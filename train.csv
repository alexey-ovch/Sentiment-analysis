Best music experience ever,1
Lots of music I can't find any place elseâœ“âœ“âœ“ I love Spotify!!! Premium is the only way to go though,0
I Actually love Spotify helps me sleep and let's me have my own Playlist I juts kinda wish you would make more skips and let Mobile people be able to loop a song!! Over all really good app,0
Absolutely fantastic. All the music I want and need is here.,1
Bro I hate the fact I can't preview sings while adding song to my playlist it's stupid. I get trying to make money but at least make it so we can play a sing whenever we want yall have over a billion downloads ur making enough money give some of us broke people some premium features. Also the amount or ads is stupid and the 30 min of ad free listening is bs two 3 min songs ain't 30 min,0
umm ive been using it for a while but ever since you guys updated it ive been getting alot of ads and whats going on with this only a limited amount of skips i really dont like that part then i have to wait a hour but ive always loved spotify but that skips thing is really pissing me off honestly,0
My Spotify app isn't working at all when I try to my some music it just stucks and It been two days.,0
"I'm about done with Spotify, no matter what I do. The songs are always in random no matter what I do and it's pissing me TF off. I'm paying $10 for service of random music? I've contacted the company regarding this and it's always the run around. ""Uninstall reinstall"" (I did) "" goto settings ' (did that also) and nothing changed. This is probably my last month of using this service. Time to start handing my money over to Amazon or YouTube",0
"ok so everything's great. Spotify is literally my home and most used app but it still hasn't given me the lyric sharing feature. i am tired of updating again and again. i really hope i get the feature now, since i have premium too. and it sucks when everyone around me has the feature.",1
Seems like the random stopping of music has been fixed.thank you! And also people If you can accept what's included on the free spotify aspotify app just upgrade And stop complaining!!,0
"Background music seems broken in Spotify. In the past the app would keep playing in the background, but now whenever my phone screen is off Spotify stops playing and i have to wake the phone for it to continue. This is really annoying... can you please fix this?",0
"Music keeps pausing constantly on my Samsung S21!!!! Terrible experience, even for downloaded songs",0
"Still need to iron out some bugs and performance issues. Having to double back gesture or if playlists is getting annoying. Fixed: I really hate that it's missing the swipe to add to queue gesture from iOS, other than that it's perfect",0
"Takes a while to open but once connected, music selections are great",1
"I honestly love this app, It has amazing sound quality and everything, but these ads its getting annoying.After playing one song one ad starts playing.And these goes on. please reduce these ads.I was getting irritated. You are just forcing us to buy premium. Please fix this or I am uninstalling Spotify",0
"I had over 50 hours of music... makes no sense to hear the same song 3 times a day. Then it gets stuck on one artist. No time for this nonsense!I I had a diverse library, and enjoyed Spotify when it worked properly. Fix your repetitive old nonsense and I'll come back.",1
What happen Spotify!! It keeps shutting off after 2 or song the app and the song stops and I need to play it again. It is annoying when every certain minutes I need to reopen and play again.,0
I never listened to Spotify before Joe Rogan. Now I love them! Not just for the podcast but also the music. And thank God Neil Young is gone. I don't want to listen to that hypocritical boomer!,0
Wonder,1
"Long, long, long time customer on many different platforms over the years. Something is seriously wrong with the recent updates. The app is almost unusable there are so many glitches and that's no exaggeration. Please pull back the recent build or get a new one out ASAP. This is the very first time I've ever even thought to cancel. I've already done reinstalls and it's not getting better. It's so bad, I would go as far as saying due to recent public protests from staff, this may be sabotage.",0
Worst experience to be a music app due to advertisements. After 1 song there are 3 consecutive advertisement wasting worth 1:24 minutes just on advertisement for my 4 or 5th song. ... ... This is really a bery bad experience for me .,0
"I've had this app for a long time with no issues, but recently it's stopped giving me the now playing window that allows me to stop and start the current song. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling it. If there was a recent update... it's not working!!",0
"Used to use Spotify for parties, since everyone could play music together. Sessions absolutely suck now. It's a hassle to let people join them, and the music plays on every device. It's extremely annoying. Now I just use YouTube since guests can join without hassle and add stuff to the queue.",0
"This app is amazing, I works fine for me. But when I didn't have premium there were way too many ads and it's not fair that people can't choose their own songs when they want.",0
I like this app because so many songs are there when i am going to sleep that time i think to hear songs my favourite song i type and it will come,1
This app keeps crashing. Doesn't show need of updating or any of that.,0
Smooth and always innovative,1
"Was great to use at one time. They keep updating things and changing things that are not broken. One example is car mode which is still not replaced with the ""better"" feature they said they were working on months ago. So far the only fix is buy a separate module for your car, which is only available the U.S. Very poor app experience lately.",0
Control your platform. Don't allow hate mongeringand and spread of misinformation. Very disappointed.,0
So far I like using Spotify,1
I lovr this app so many others do as well. And if it is good for over 3.5 billion people to use it is good for you to. Download the app now.,0
I'm not paying to see advertisements for podcasts. I'm not paying to see podcasts I accidentally listened to pop up permanently on my front home page. What is nonsense,0
"Update: something is wrong with the app. It is so glitchy. Trouble playing, won't connect to Bluetooth, can't see song playing or get back to it. Have to continuously close and restart app to get to play.",0
"Broken since the newest update! I can no longer use the app with my headphones. I can't see what song are playing, in the car or on the phone. I can't stop the music. I had to force stop it to stop the music!",0
"The Ads. They are more than any other music app. Decrease them before I uninstall the app. I just use it bcz I have already made a playlist on this, but the interruptions are crucially time-taking.",0
Great app for streaming. Except randomly stops playing and I have to push the play button to get it going again.,0
Listening to my favorite artists and letting me branch out to find music everyday is the best experience. Always something new and I'm here for it,1
Still haven't fixed random pausing and play bar bugs.,0
"Website works phone on my phone, but app just spins and spins and never loads. Web also connects to Google cast devices, app can't figure it out. ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸",0
"A lot of music to choose from, Good app.",1
Keep it up but add all songs including garhwali,1
Best music app by far. Linked to my Peloton which is my favorite part.,1
"A great music App..,ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜",1
This was my top music app because I could use this app while using others without paying...UNTILL they started playing recommindations on my playlist! They should install an option if you want there recommends So I went back to youtube,0
Absolutely love using this app for music and podcasts!!,1
"The app is amazing. The selection is broad, and their recommendations are on point. I dont use premium, but ads aren't too problematic. The only problem is that the app absorbs storage. I'm not sure why, because I use wifi and clear the cache, but the app still takes up over a GB of storage. It's a minimal annoyance, but inconvenient nevertheless. Overall, I would reccomend it.",0
The onlything is when payment is due Spotify cuttes out for3days,0
Please...add the option dowloading individual songs what we like from album,0
"Good quality music, but there are many Tamil songs are missing, examples: Minnal oru kodi and Malargale, both ARR music composition are missing ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”",0
STAR,1
"Constant bugs, popping in songs requiring a restart. Song-based radios might not even have the ""based off of"" song in the playlist. Regurgitated radios, very difficult to find it curate new to me music, it just trys to play my already liked songs. If I find and save an new awesome playlist, the next time I check it's full of my liked songs and missing the fresh stuff. Give us a true dislike button to customize music. Stop trying to play artists I have marked as do not play. Etc I could go on",0
Just like how easy it is to use,0
This app is good until it crashes it gets frustrated when this happens even if you have the latest version it still crashes!,0
If I say play my liked songs don't play songs that I didn't like I liked them for a reason so I can listen to it,1
Its so great but annoyed the ad...,0
"the new update is making the app worst, fix it develop.",0
third class app,1
"Auto recommended music , sounds quality sharp , bass just perfect to go along with all song.",1
Bruh how many ads will they play I already got 8 ads stop playing ads ðŸ˜’,0
"It has all varieties of songs ,of all genres, of all ages,of all singers from old times to the latest ones.",1
Reasons behind my 1 star rating- 1The ad pop ups which are unskipable 2I fas also not able to skip some part of music 3YOUTUBE MUSIC is the best now ,1
I have Spotify premium and it is worth it. Best music app by far that I can say is worth my money!,1
It's an very good app....But by the time the ads are continuous increasing...I think the company should handle this,1
this is the best app ever i recomend it here is a reason why.there are so many diffrent musics and the best artists ever and there are so many musics to pick,1
"SECURITY ISSUE. The accounta are not secure, avoid signing in with your email service if you cannot avoid using the app. Have been using it for almost a year to discover this. Your login information is NOT secure. Apart from that.. App is not upto the standard. Bells and whistles but no quality. Low quality customer support for a paid service. The audio is very low quality, also the support executives have zero clue about their own product.",0
Please fix! After the update there is nothing but start and stop. The app just stops and you need to physically restart. I already tried reinstalling but today it is very bad! I love spotify but this is terrible and unusable lately.,0
"Upd2 I'm a long paying customer, yet everything in the app is designed to prevent me from contacting support, but why?? You want a letter in post? // Do songs dissappear from Liked Songs?? and... Please ... add ""refresh"" function for Daily Mix playlist - when pull it to change your suggestions for another ones (e.g when you've already fed them to me yesterday ) - similar wishes in 2020, nothing changed since 2019.",0
"Sir, my Spotify is not working my internet is good but he says you are offline I try every thighs but still it is not working ðŸ™ please solve us problem",0
I love it. Wide range of choices in genres and Artists!,1
"My only place for music, podcasts, audiobooks.",0
keeps shutting off 1 time soon after opening and playing After that it usually stays on,1
"Pretty good. I've been editing my videos while listening to Spotify and it feels so good! Just one problem. I want to be able to have unlimited skips whenever I want without having to buy premium, which disturbs my music. If you could remove that, I'll give this app a five! ðŸ˜Š",1
The adds get gradually worse the longer you use it to the point where it's unbearable. Every other song is multiple 30 seconds ads,0
"On the whole, it's great. Mostly a brilliant experience. The only gripe is that it doesn't go to landscape while playing music in full screen? It turns into a tiny interface in the bottom corner and displays no artwork and car mode doesn't rotate at all despite the phone settings.",0
Problem after updated. When clicking the button play..apps shutdown. Pls solve this problem even i pay ready.,0
The best music platform,1
"Very nice app for music listening, can't live without it. Only thing that I don't like is that it isn't integrated into samsung mobiles, because samsung music let's you browse on spotify within the samsung app but you can't log on to your personal spotify account inside that same exact app. Spotify gets my 5 star if they fully integrate into samsung mobiles (Hope it can be a choice for people that have spotify). Also a landscape mode when I play a song would be nice to have in the mobile appðŸ˜Š",0
Nice,1
Love Spotify I can find my music in a matter of seconds but there's a bug I'll tap on one so g and it will put a whole different artist and song on but otherwise it is a great appðŸ˜˜ðŸ’•ðŸ’…ðŸ’…,1
"I've been using this app for multiple years and it is awesome, if your using premium. If you don't have don't have premium, it's filled with ads and unskipable Songs. If you can afford premium though I would highly recommend it as I couldn't imagine my life with out Spotify.",1
Just great everything nothing much else to say!,1
Stupid ads play to often but apart from that it's on,0
Great as you can select your favourite music,1
Was great but now a pain to use. The app will continuously say I have something playing even after a phone restart but nothing is on. I also have it randomly going to songs that I have never listened to halfway through another. Becoming unusable.,0
"For some reason, itll only play a song for a few seconds, and it wont let me access the playlists I've created, please fix this",0
Too much advertising. I don't like it. I think you should make one ad for whenever we open the app.,0
"The new update is a big disappointment. It is so so so worse. The previous version was good. In this new version, you can't play a specific song from your playlist. You can't skip songs. And if you search a song, you won't get to listen to that song but will song dome random song. It is really disappointing!!!",0
So many ads after the latest update. It make me wanna uninstall it,0
This app is amaizing l h've been using it for a year and a half the boring part is you can't download the music for offline,0
"I think this is great app all around with a good monthly premium cost, well worth it. I love that you can make your own playlist and also a wide variety of artists to choose from. I don't like to pay for hardly anything but I pay for this for sure.",1
Constantly have to close down app and restart because of pausing.,0
"Everytime I need to search the song ad play, I can't enjoy songs because of its Random shuffle is very bad. If I search one song then it doesn't shuffles and stops after playing only one song.",0
"Update: The last version behaves wierdly and won't display the ""now playing"" bar and I have no way to control the playback. Please fix! Poco F3@android 12. Original post: Works well as a paid user. Don't forget to increase the quality to highest when you register, in the settings. Needs hi-res quality like the competition for premium users.",0
"Lyrics are not coming in Hindi,. Instead of that they are showing in urdu",0
It's wonderful!- even without Spotify Premium...though the ads have been getting longer,1

Great service and easy to use. Highly recommend,1
"How are u the worst and the only 1 thats good..ish I can't stand how everything that a normal streaming app SHOULD have is behind a pay wall how come I can't just get the song I want I have too go in to a TRASH playlist just too find the song and sometimes it's the 2nd or 3rd song in the playlist IF YOUR LUCKY it could be SOOOOS FAR in the playlist, your the effin EA/Dice of music streaming like Goddam, I can't just find a song from a creator to my knowledge. I'm just mad u shouldn't acknowledg",0
"Spotify got it (almost) all! Watch, voice assistent, android auto, shazam integration, wide music portfolio. On the other hand, missing some very basic features like better management of podcast automatic downloads, history of songs listened to.",0
Very limited internationally,0
"Enjoy listening to the songs I love. Each time I search for songs to listen to, I find ""new"" songs (oldies, but goodies) to add to my collection. And the ads are short and tolerable.",0
"Had my doubts about Spotify, but love the free version of their app. Music without adds. Thankyou Spotify.",0
Awesome!! I don't even need to store music in my phone. Everything is here on Spotify. Already organised for me as well. Very impressed with the app.,1
Find it kind of fascinating to find a variety of music to wake up to!!!,1
"I absolutely love Spotify, especially the feature that allows you to listen to certain like genres of music, except it hasn't been working lately. Like I would select country and Christian music would start playing or I'd select rap music and musical would start playing. The apps genre play feature in liked songs is not working at all!",0
"I love love love Spotify! I'm 61 and here I can find the music I grew up with. Whether it's Rubber Band Man or Train kepta Rolling, it's here.",1
Constantly loses my spot and I paid to no listen to ads. On android this app barely works. I constantly have to restart this app and refind my spot in every podcast. Not worth any amount of money. I'd leave if it weren't for Joe Rogan.,0
The Android app kinda sucks. It had bugs and frequently crashes. I do like it better than Pandora though,0
I've used Spotify for a while now and it's been great until the new update. I can't see the song playing like normal anymore. I can't rewind or skip songs anymore. Please fix this as I want to continue using Spotify but can't if I can't see and can't skip/rewind a song.,0
It's an awesome app but the only thing I hate is the ads...it's too frequent nowadays..and sometimes when I got to uninstall the app and reinstall after few min all the songs dissapear and I've had to re-search and add the songs to my playlist again but this happens very rarely maybe you've fixed it and that's great. Overall I really love this app..user friendly and amazing songs are made jus for you. â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,1
Allows podcasters that spread misinformation and lies. I can't support companies that allow the spread of misinformation.,0
"Thank God Spotify has integrity. At the moment, they do not stand for cencorship. I use this app mostly for podcast but it also fulfill my musical preferences. Better than YouTube imo.",1
"I changed my phone and i factory reset the old one, but I can't download songs even when I'm premium and it says I have to erase the downloaded songs from the old device to listen to the new one??? Idk what to do",0
Love this app but one thing I would add. Where you click button that would listen to the music and tell you what it is.,1
Ok spotify fixed the issue I had and now I'll go ahead and say it's really good hahaha the only issue is the region locked songs but whatever.,1
Good selection of music,1
"Theres some problem about the pc and android, for the pc you can like skipped the line but on android you cant",0
"I've had no choice but to resort to streaming. Every conceivably convenient way of having music on my phone is defunct. Other than that I can say that it works, at least.",0
I love to listen to music. Spotify makes it easy to do and gives me a variety of songs!! I like the commercial free also!!,1
I click on a song it does not do that song,0
When working properly it's great. The app randomly changes episodes/song while your listening. Only fix is a uninstall and reinstall every other week. Gets old.,0
I keep going offline. I have completed all suggestions but still happening.,1
"I do lots and lots of driving and I love music, so that means I listen to a lot of music. Spotify is a great app other than the fact that they don't know how to shuffle. I have repeats all the time on playlist that I know are days long. It's quite annoying for me to click one of my playlists and have repeats within the first couple hours.",1
"I enjoy it. Could use a few more options, like a random shuffle play of everything you've downloaded or maybe just a surprise me Playlist of random stuff. Could be interesting. I'm just happy with no commercials.",1
"One of my favorite apps! All the music I love and I can make as many playlists as I want. Any artist, any song, you can find it. Highly recommend to anyone who loves music!",1
Too many ads on the base version,0
Great app lots of music and can read lyrics too!,1
"I appreciate Spotify's content especially their support of speech and open dialog, but the app itself is clunky and unreliable. It's frustrating that the controls to pause or navigate content stop working after switching between apps, even after switching back to the Spotify app, making it impossible to pause or stop playback without restarting my phone. Come on Spotify the technicals matter, delivery and user experience is just as important as content.",0
"Seems the last up date broke the app. Pod cast cut off, the play bar disappears from the bottom and it keeps playing, I can't pause anything. I have to close the app and re open it really annoying, I hope they are working on it.",0
"Annoying that it starts playing randomly in my car. It auto starts when I turn my car on, when I answer a call, when I hang up, when I turn my stereo on, etc. If I turn off permissions to avoid this then it doesn't work properly. Like the service, hate the app.",0
Cool but ads irrititating,0
"I liked the app until the newest version. The older version in my opinion better. 6 skips an hour really? The songs that get added to the Playlists are the most annoying, they never end. Before i would rate Spotify 5 stars but this, it's not something i have seen anywhere.(sorry for wasting your time if you are a normal person but if you help Spotify tell them to fix this. Im not the only one here that wants this fixed too.)",0
"Nice app for listening to music. Huge library of songs and many functionalities to make your experience more enjoyable. Two downsides for me are: 1. Even with a premium account, half the time when you open the app you get pop-ups which you already said no to many times before. Becomes real annoying after a while. 2. The settings are all in one menu and look pretty long and complex. It provides many nice configurations, but chances are after seeing the menu, you'll never look through it.",0
Excellent app for your entertainment all-day and night long... Can you believe thisðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ it gives me time to pay my credit before taking my song's away,1
I love the idea that I cuold listen the whole album o just the music that I want to listen.,1
I have a Samsung S22 and and I love all the music you'll have especially the disco and everything is just tremendously 2 minutes late good to hear I enjoy it And it's fun music too so anyone can enjoy it,1
"The apps functionality is very poor, when I play a postcast I can't get controls have the time. And it consistently forgets where I am on my podcasts.",0
Great podcasts. Great music playlists,1
Poor optimization and network issue,0
"I can't use the app when storage is setting to SD ""something went wrong""",0
Spotify is good but can i have a request that when u pick a song theres a download button so u can listen without internet,0
I like it alot good for music,1
Automatically logging out. Can't log in again and the 'you are offline' keep appearing even though I have a stable connection? I was just peacefully listening then all of the sudden it logs out and gives me hard time to log in again because of that offline thing. Please fix this.,0
"Super buggy, even when clicking the direct link to the songs I want to listen to, it will only play a clip and gives me no way to play the song from the app. Had to go to it in the browser to get it to play.",0
Outstanding app. Hope you give more freebies to new and old users.,1
Cant even got my account back when getting a new phone without making a new account im bot paying twice,0
"I love the app, but for some reason my music is skipping when played through my bluetooth earbuds. #Edit: Uninstalling and reinstalling the app fixed the problem.",0
Lovely great must but only if I could download without premium,1
"App is alright other then whenever i get a call on my phone ,the next song starts playing in the call which is verry anoying.",1
"I searched a song. It return results, clearly said it is a single. I clicked on the single. It played an shuffle list, didn't even let me to listen for the song I searched for. Even unable to skip.",0
4 ads eveyry 2 songs. Worst thing is if you dont have premium you cant even choose what you wanna listen to you can just shuffle play,0
Sometimes it will kick me out of the app and won't let me reopen it again.,0
Why is it so hard to allow you to go down the list of songs u have on phone when u can do it on other devices. Always shuffle play,0
"Seamless, high quality I'm particularly grateful that Spotify is an advocate of free speach",1
It is because you don't have the right lyrics for a song,0
Good app but what's the delay on us getting lyrics on mobile versiin...please work on this asap... And was my previous comment deleted or what?,0
"9 ads just to listen music, you're gonna listen to more ads than actual music.",0
Good,1
Because it's very cool and good song play,1
"I use Spotify for the podcasts and it is constantly crashing, stopping my podcast within a few minutes of playing it, or skipping to the next one without actually playing it. Please fix your broken and worthless app.",0
I can't even play my Playlist like I wanted it to be,0
It's easy to find songs for me and it's cool how Spotify gets a playlist with music close to the music you listen to.,1
Good music,1
App keeps crashing. Track controls dont come up. Have to shut down and reboot constantly.,0
It's awesome and very useful app..,1
Easy to navigate : just type music of interest and it gives good suggestions.,1
"Truly amazing app, but I'd like to put a caveat on that. Paying for Premium is a nightmare in my country. If I could pay in cash, I would, and I tried to call in a favour from someone in another country, but the payment didnt go through because of country codes.",0
"I've used spotify since it first came out, and it's absolutely my favorite music service platform.",1
Best music player ever! ðŸ˜‹,1
"The app is great, and the recommendation system is also nice. However - can we have a filter by country? We're at war here in Ukraine, and I would very much appreciate if you could cut me off from russian artists that keep squeezing into my ""Recommended""! This issue bothered me from the very beginning, but now it became even more stressing. Thanks!",1
"Extremely infuriating, I pay for Premium and Spotify wont even let me play the songs in MY playlist without playing a random ""recommended"" one, and there is no solution for this, and if there is they have done an incredible job of making the UI as confusing, cluttered and unnavigatable as possible. Unsubscribed, am now using a competitor, which is a lot better, for free.",0
"Enjoyed the Spotify Premium service in particular. My most sincere complements and thanks to all of the very talented staff there at Spotify. You can tell much thought went into even the most minute detail. Spotify staff truly love what they do and in doing so, they show how much respect and genuine care they have for their customers.",1
"With every update this app seems to get worse. Frequent crashes are very annoying. Often when I pick something to play, the app will say ""Spotify is trying to play..."" but it is playing the audio I want, but without the controls to pause/fast-forward/rewind being available. To fix this I have to close the app multiple time and re open it. Spotify is awesome, but the app flat out sucks now.",0
"Latest update glitches. It turns off every 10 minutes, won't allow the playback screen so you can't skip. I have to force stop, even after Uninstall / reinstall. I pay for this service, already downgraded my plan, may drop entirely if this is not fixed",0
I consider my musical taste as extremely eclectic. Spotify allows me to indulge in my eclecticism. For you to appreciate what I mean check out my playlist ECLECTIC IMAGES on Spotify.,1
Ads are bit repetitive and you should have a feature allowing you to listen to only the album you're trying to listen to. You should also be able to choose which artist show up on your Bumble app.,0
"So you seriously adding songs to my playlists? Songs that i don't want, that are nothing like the songs i added?",1
Way better than pandora,1
If I could give them a negative five I would I tried to cancel the premium service before the subscription was up and they still charge me after I hadn't used it for a whole week after subscription was over. When I talk to chat they told me that they closed my account but then my account was charged a second time and I still have premium service that I do not want and I'm paying for and I do not use it,0
"I cant seem to delete strange albums i find in my library that i didn't even put in the list, Spotify just keeps recommending me stuff i wouldn't normally listen to and put it in my library without my permission.",1
"Works alright most of the time but I don't know what it does with downloads. They keep disappearing. Also, I get logged out when there's no network. It's let me down a lot in no network areas. Fix the offline mode issue for the other two stars. Quite annoying.",0
Spotify is a phenomenal app. Hands down one of the best apps for streaming music and podcasts; not even trying to sound like a bot.,1
Love how i have my music on shuffle but somehow manages to play the same 15 songs even though i got over 500,1
Got 6 ads in a row but good service,1
"Lately got issues to connect,tho im online and got premium. Otherwise I love this app",1
I love using my Spotify app on my Chromebook It is way better than listening to Youtube which has adds I do not own Spotify Premium and I never get adds I do have a couple of issues but I will keep my rating at 5 star My app just laggs a bit and only lets me play certain songs in my school district But other than that I love spotify Definetly recommend,1
Best music app out there. Premium is worth the purchase.,1
Great app but lots of adds sometimes even if you do the 30 min of no adds,1
"Definitely 5 stars! Amazing music streaming platforms, I've tried out a few. Deezer was good as well, but I prefer Spotify thanks to the simplicity and still being able to compact in loads of features!",1
I will give it 5 star but it shows too much ads if we ignore ads then it is the best app for listening music it only take 15mb or above data for playing music 30 mins or above,1
"5 stars, for the most of the times. Car mode could improve. Some songs are not there, but all in all... It rocks ðŸ˜Š",1
I can't listen to anything because the play button doesn't actually work but it will play randomly and then stop randomly and you cannot press any buttons because the app doesn't think it's playing anything..... and this is on premium... you want people to pay money for this?,0
3-star rating for the issues with the app over the last few months.,0
It's pathetic how much Spotify has changed in a year. The app is basically useless if you don't pay for premium. You can't listen to a song if you search it up. Can only skip a few songs before you have to listen to an ad. Also 5 ads in a row? Have the developers gone insane?,0
"It's been great, only issue I may have is, with my one very big Playlist, it still repeats some songs, as though there is only like 20 songs instead of 100, but besides that I enjoy it",1
"Not sure why the newer update, makes my music randomly pause . And it never syncs up with my galaxy watch . Always says I'm playing something completely different.",0
First it was playing the right music but then it started playing random musics,0
This app is have the best music ever,1
I love Spotify I can find all the music I like and make different lists I can connect it to my Alexa and ask her to play my list on Spotify it's great,1
"Great App, links across devices and plays the things I love. Ideally you should subscribe to Spotify for optimum usage",1
"Been a loyal spotify listener for the better part of 7 years as of late been nothing but trouble seriously need to sort it out lagging,music doesnt play,play screen not showing up",0
Enjoyed the music nice and clear.,1
Great UI and good Playlists,1
The constant music interruption is going to cause me to unsubscribe.,0
"Was a good app but now they're getting excessive with ads, its about the same amount of ads as there is music, plus they mix random songs in your playlists and won't let you pick a certain song without premium.",0
"Right now as soon as I start vacation it is not working, not loading. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, forced stopped, restarted my phone. This is beyond annoying!!! Edit, got a new phone and app still not working!!! Everyone else in my family plan has a working spotify except myself and I am the plan account holder.",0
"I can't listen to a song I want to without it being on shuffle. The app was better off without this update on thr interface. For gods sake I can't even skip songs without premium?? OR go back to songs. Update ruined the app, I rather just download youtube music",0
"Crashes every time I switch apps. Tried to uninstall and reinstall, I think it's worse now",0
I'm deleting this app idk if anyone else gets this problem but it's not letting me listen to my songs I can't choose my song it just plays a random one and I can't take it,0
It's a wonderful app I really love it Spotify is best forever really â¤â¤â¤,1
Excellent,1
The app has gone downhill along with Spotify in general. Buggy mess along with management.,0
"Something wrong , running slow , logs out automatically frequently",0
The whole customer service experience usually takes way to long to fix a simple issue. By the time they got back to me I was already irritated enough to cancel payments through my bank. Loyal user for 6 years and I'm kind of over it.,0
I haven't been able to enjoy music on any other app like I am this one (Spotify) and creating an account is completely Free!,0
Too many bugs! Keeps crashing or playing at random. No longer has the control bar either. Please fix!!!,0
Excellent music service,1
It's amazing sound feeling I love it spotify ðŸ™ƒ,1
"The entire app breaks every few updates, it's like they have no quality control. It's not just my phone brand either, everyone in my family's Spotify apps have become borderline unusable with this most recent update.",0
Love it. No adds just music.,1
This is really frustrating. The app was all good in my tab a few weeks ago but then all of my playlist and downloaded songs won't appear even while using wifi. I can't even play any playlists saying it's all empty??! What's the sense of paying premium if I can't even access my offline library or play any music? You need to fix this ASAP.,0
"Unintuitive, buggy, and censorious. Bad experience. No up/downvoting. No commenting. Ads in paid version! Final straw: you removed Joe Rogan videos. Leaving for better platforms. You suck.",0
"It does't matter the musical genre, my mood or the time. The suggestions raise the bar, too.",0
"PLEASE add the possibility to delete the shows from ""your shows"" I hate the fact that if you try to listen to one it will always have to be visible, I even tried listening to other shows to push the embarrassing things back but they're still there and it's annoying. Please fix this",0
"It's a really good app to play music/podcasts, but I dont really like how much it changed and how more aggressive it is to non-premuim users. Non-premium users are beaten to the point where all they can do is only shuffle. I didnt have premium for a day, and I felt like I got pushed off a roof. PC and Console players that use spotify without premium arent as punished as non premium mobile players.",0
I used to have pandora but switched to this and never looked back highly recommend switchingðŸ’¯ðŸ‘Œ,1
"Great app, sadly since quite a while it is not possible to get a list with all the songs of an interpret of choice... Only the top 5 songs. Why is there no ""show all songs"" button :( And no I don't want to shuffle the interpret to get all songs in the queue.",0
This was an amazing app although I would appreciate it if you would PUT LESS FUCCIN ADS,1
"Music is constantly shutting off , and I have to go back in and turn spotify on. Can you fix this problem ?",0
The app isn't optimised for low connection speeds and spotty connections.,0
THE APP IS GREAT .. GREAT QUALITY SOUND IS FINE AND EVERYTHING IS WELL BUT WHEN I HEAR KOREAN THEN THE LYRICS CAME IN KOREAN I CAN'T ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE LYRICS OR ANY INTERNATIONAL PLEASE FIX IT OTHERWISE IT IS AWSOME APP LOVE IT BUT SPOTIFY PLEASE FIX THAT ISSUE AND GIVE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN KOREAN LINE....... OR ANY OTHER SONG THANKS,1
Good content lots music and podcasts reliable,1
Sometimes the app just skips to the end of the podcast after an advisement. Now I have to scan through the podcast to find where Spotify decided I had to move on but fought back. If Joe Rogan wasn't on this app I would NEVER use it.,0
Great app for organizing my fav podcasts. I've upgraded to premium and I think it's worth it.,1
"Spotify asked me to rate them and I did, ur welcome Spotify.",1
"Selection is good, queue is cumbersome to use and edit",0
This is my most used app and I love it so much with the different choices of music.,1
"Spotify player controls that are normally displayed at the bottom, disappear. Will leave the music running and is unable to pause. Have to force stop to stop music.",0
I hate when they add suggestions onto my playlist.,0
Love it the website got all kinds of artists & songs I'm enjoying this app to the max thanks,1
I paid 129â‚¹ for a premium but i haven't received premiumship yet.,0
"Stupid constant emails, annoying pop ups, can't dislike anything so you keep getting the same stupid recommendations. Fed up getting ads disguised as suggestions in the paid version. Sick of my ""top mixes"" having nothing in common with anything i ever listen to.",0
The app is good with the sings and stuff and i understand about the ads but why i can't go back to a song or skip a part of the song when i am in a playlist? This is really annoying please fix it.,0
This is the best app for listening to music and streaming and enjoying your fav songs and podcasts. It is a must try and I would also highly recommend the Spotify Premium.,1
The best music listening program ever made. The only thing I did not like the program missing referral program. It is better making referral program available for customers and offering them some privileges for each attracted person.,0
"It's an amazing app, at first I always downloaded my songs from YouTube with a converter to my phone. I always told my friends how many good things I could do with the playlist on my phone for free, than when you compared that with spotify. But about a month ago I was persuaded by friends to try spotify out at least. And it was so much better than expected. Both thumbs up!!ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ» I'm not gonna delete it as I actually would have expected.",1
When I pick a song it always plays a different song please fix this bug.,0
I have been using Spotify for years now. I have had no problem with the app. Getting Premium is a great thing to have and easy to get.,1
"STOP ADDING SONGS TO MY PLAYLIST! I HATE IT! IF YOU STOP DOING THAT, ILL GIVE YPU 4 STARS! GOD.",0
I love this app it is so given Hindi english nepali song,1
Have all my fav songs.playlists(mine and others) downloaded for when no internet available I can rock on the trails! Settings are awesome for what you can do with playback!,1
Great selection of music. I love my daily mixes. Pity you have to subscribe to get rid of the repetitive adverts,0
"this is one the best bocus and useless app during creating account , i had became fullly angry.",0
There's this dumb thing where I clicked on a podcast by accident trying to listen to my favorite song and the podcast won't go away it's directly under the good afternoon thing and Iv tried and it just won't go away,0
I cant hear or see myspotify wrapped 2021 it's been 3days I tried clearing the storage and cache no use can ull please fix this really looking forward to see my wrapped .. overall the app is great for music lovers Yea the ads a little.. But Its a great app I loved from all the music streaming apps please do fix this please please pleaseplease,1
Great I can listen to any artist I like,1
Spotify is not working since the morning. My all the playlists and liked song are gone. The whole app is empty. Uninstalled and reinstalled but still not working.,0
"Keeps on crashing when i play something. I can open the app and navigate without any problem but when i start to play something, it crashes/closes automatically...",0
Kind of sucks how it's only in shuffle but at the same time I think it's a good thing because you don't have to decide what plays next.,1
"I love this app. I have premium, which is totally worth it. It's so easy to make playlists and find new music.",1
Exceptional,1
I love this app it just has many ads,1
Nice app with lot of music,1
I'll give you more stars when you quit screwing over Tom McDonald!,1
Money grubbers Cant even skip the song these days without premium,1
"The best app ever, i wish the premium would be cheaper but I just can't live without it",0
I really don't like this app just bcoz of its ads they literally show ads after 1 or 2 songs. I have used jiosavan before spotify and even without premium they don't show ads so frequently and spotify is just worst in this particular perspective. I hope u will sort this problem out.,0
"the recommended songs just annoys me, i just wanna listen to the songs i have on the playlist yet it just plays different songs that isn't even in my playlist, there was this one song that wasn't even in my playlist yet it said it was in it, i checked the playlist and it wasn't even there. This update just sucks not gonna lie",0
"Spotify is now my daily-living essential and music is my main most beneficial medication. As always Nothing is perfect being I wish spotify would share with pioneer dj / rekordbox, I'm looking forward for when its is sharing!. #TOPAPP",1
Better than the other satellite radio station offered. I like that you can customize your music. I have the premium subscription with no advertising great option.-,0
"love Spotify, audio is so much cleaner and clearer than youtube... if you have a sound car or bass vehicle or hi-fi setup at home pls use Spotify. if you put the same song in a eq, youtube will be louder, but there are dramatic spikes and distortion, on Spotify it is actually a really clean graph, 0% distortion and hardly any spikes... or distortion = no blown speakers kids",0
THE APP BEST AND I LISTEN THE BEST SONGS IN SPOTIFY AND THE BEST MUSIC APP BUT THE APP IN ALL SONGS BUT BEST MUSIC APP I GIVE 5 STARS YOU DOWNLOAD NOW,1
Just a great app for all music,1
I love the old songs and the franch song it's so amazing,1
This app works great on my Samsung tablet and phone as well as my wife's iPhone.,1
"Cool App, â¤ï¸ it! Thanks to the Developer",1
All of a sudden the song that I'm listening to isn't available for me to see. Like I can change my song or anything. Idk what's going on,0
"So far I have had a good time with spotify premium, except for one bug, a few times the music has cut out midway through and I have to restart the song again. Other than that a positive experience with spotify so far.",0
To much ads and it could improve podcast offer and presentation.,0
This is a very good app please download it and enjoy music,1
"Poor quality. It's gone downhill drastically in the past two years. Never opens, or operates properly. Even with latest updates and reinstalling app weekly. Deletes downloaded Playlists, doesn't play downloaded songs when I'm not connected to network. Removes artists that are LGBTQIA and songs about weed, but leaves Joe Rogan and other misinformation spreaders. Getting a new music app, this one has finally hit the last of my patience. They also take mass profits from creators and artists. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž",0
Latest version has bug that doesn't display what's currently playing. Huge issue.,0
Keeps logging me out and am currently trying to log back in nothing is working and it keeps saying it sent me a link and it doesnt show up. I've been trying to fix this problem for the past 4 hours straight with help and still no success. Spotify is usually really great but its acting really stupid right now and i just don't understand. Fix this problem immediately.,0
"Underdeveloped cockleper , cant check on what you have listened on pc, when you want to listen on phone. deevelopers are responsible",0
Has to be the best music app ive tried.,1
Can't actually play songs in want to play. Chose a song and it plays a play list that song might be in.... completely useless if you want to play specific songs.,0
My favorite part of the app is the free podcasts. Plus I get to download to listen to anytime! I love it!,1
"App force closes constantly, new bugs pop up every week. For how big this app is it shouldn't have so many issues",0
I can say that this app is marvelous I can go through songs of any language like English or hindi with lyrics and this is what I like the most,1
I was worried about the his app because I knew little about it. But after all the hype about Joe Rogan I wanted to listen to him shure glad I did and the app works very well for the podcast,1
"It's been glitchy lately and music skips like scratched CD. And today, when I tried opening the app, it stayed at the logo and wouldn't load. I tried uninstall and install again, restarting my phone doesn't work either.",0
"Ever since the last couple of app updates it crashes on me every 10 minutes or so. The playing bar keeps getting stuck on a song or podcast too, so I have no clue what I'm listening to. When it connects to my truck it creates issues and often my phone will start playing after I've shut my truck off, which it never used to do before. Not impressed. I've tried redownloading the app and still have the same problems. Considering switching to another music provider.",0
I've used Spotify for those long as I can remember but as long as I can remember it's always never let me play music offline and it was wondering if you could fix that and then I will go ahead and keep it if not I will delete it thanks amazing app one it works wonders has all my favorite songs,1
Don't know what happened but app extremely buggy lately,0
it has been a ride i dont want to get of...,0
"SPOTIFY IS SUPERB, but ADS makes me wanna suicide. Please do something of these ads. And it would be awesome if you guys made organising and customizing playlists more easy and compatible. But come on, please do something of the ads. (YOURS ADS MAKES MORE SURE TO NOT BUY YOUR PREMIUM)",0
Best app for happy and sad moments. I pinky promise.,1
Love that whatever I'm in the mood to listen to I can find it on Spotify.,1
"I'm a premium user and enjoy the app greatly, WHEN and IF it works properly. Connectivity bugs and long loading times plague this platform.",1
It's only good for like 2 3 years after that it just repeats the same 15 songs doesn't matter what play list you look up or what radio station you create. It's starting to get annoying,0
Lots of variety of music and very good audio quality,1
My experyence was great you caan play any song you want or any raper and with no adds what so ever.,1
I love Spotify but it keeps logging out for no reason. It logged out recently...while my account was set to offline mode. I can't log into my account because I need to be in online mode to do that. There is no way for me to set my account to online mode if I'm not logged in though. I plan on cancelling my subscription.,0
I can't play my playlist:/,0
Great UI. I like how I can finally have all my favourite songs in one place regardless of when it came out,1
"I don't think that we should have adds or when we get ""free premium"" we shouldn't have to put in a card :/",0
"The app is good but the searching is the problem. Whenever i search a song and listen to it, it plays a different song and i tried many times and searched different songs but it always shows playlist and when i listen to the song it still plays a different song. Please fix this.",0
High quality of sound,1
"Horrible quality, too many ads.",0
"Really enjoy the appâ¤ï¸ best app for listening music, creating music, playlists and you have every kind and genre of music....perfect app for those who think 'music is a therapy' ðŸ˜Œ",1
The app is forcing me upgrade to premium It shows ads after every song and the ad is not 3-4 seconds it's 20-30 seconds I was on this app so that i could listen to songs but all i can hear are ads,0
What is it Im Very extra Extreme and Virgo,1
"As of late the music suggestions in discover weekly and the recommended section have been much more diverse in genre and suggesting some of the best music I've ever heard, stuff I never would've found without this feature",1
"I am in a Spotify premium family plan but my account does not show the lyrics of any song. I have tried all the steps to follow posted on your website, but still it does not show the lyrics. But the owner of the family plan has lyrics on it. Is it because I am just invited? I'm back here again for a complain. My spotify premium account doesn't still have lyrics. I tried all the solutions on your website but still it doesn't have a lyric, even a just a bit. This is so frustrating.",0
It is the best music,1
I have been a part of Spotify for years and won't go anywhere else. ðŸ’¯,0
Very good music app,1
"I have no clue what's happend to my Spotify app it was working perfectly fine and now I load it up click on my playlist and all my music is gone, yet on xbox and my laptop my music is there, I don't understand why it not there on the phone app and it not just my playlist it's literally ever song on there u cannot play if it was still working this would be a 5 star rating. don't bother asking support because I was talking to them for hours and they still didn't have a clue. FIX THE APP!!!!",0
"Frequent crashes are driving me insane, had a 5 star review but I had to change it because of my issues. The app has been glitching, where it will freeze up and I can't control anything. A song will skip and unpause, then pause, rewind, pause again and so fourth. Closing the app DOESNT help and it starts conflicting with other apps audio as well. You can't physically stop it when the app does this, you have to wait till the app completely crashes before trying to re-open it.",0
"Haven't used this app for a very long time and I don't followed any changes, but before I was able to listen one song, I had to watch 8 (!) ads. Like 3 X 30 seconds and 5 X 15 seconds ad. The song was shorter than those ads",0
I don't play much music on my phone and I'm excited to use this app! Superb!,0
"Good app and all, but like could you not give me suggested songs on my liked songs Playlist please? Like I have that stuff exclusively my liked songs for a reason, nothing feels worse then getting a upbeat song when im trying to listen to my lowbeat songs. And the ads. Repetitive, hear them more then the music some times. I love the app, but man so many things could be better. Let's talk about picking and choosing a song on mobile. On computer I can no big deal but not on mobile? Its dumb imo.",0
Like Spotify. They also remove the songs the songs I love the most ( obviously play the most... that's maybe due to encourage to upgrade). I would just like if the give more suggestions of upbeat pop songs similar to Ã²thers I like... I am always confused what to search for lol ðŸ˜†.,0
Ugh. What the heck is going on Spotify? Your interface keeps getting worse. I don't get the interface anymore that provides pause and skip functionality. The app stops randomly.,0
I love the selection! There is such a range of choices. Great job Spotify.,1
Best music app i have ever used just loved it,1
amazing,1
"lyrics don't appear on my phone. The app is up to date but still nothing :( Edit: today I opened up the app and there was an ""announcement"" about the lyrics. I was excited about it, but a second later was disappointed again: no lyrics for. Updated the app but it didn't do anything. Edit 2: uninstalled and reinstalled the app on my phone, the lyrics thing appears on the songs in the library, but doesn't work at all â˜¹ï¸ I pay for this and shouldn't be having this problem",0
"Update to reemphasize that each update makes the app worse. If I could rate it below one star I would. The latest update causes glitches so music will start/stop even when not using the app. Avoid this app, use Google podcasts or iTunes",0
"Spotify is great fun, period.",1
Very nice song best Spotify,1
Enjoying everything most especially OLDTIME FAVORITES !,1
"2 years later, still using this app basically on the daily. You can find anything from UK hits, podcasts, heck, even video game music! Downloading songs are only worth it if you have a lot of phone storage, at least 8gb free. A few minor bugs whilst working with Amazon Alexa and some Samsung Edge extensions, but I'd recommend it overall. 4/5",1
"Some issues with VPN. Be careful connecting to countries like Russia, it will delete every download you have, even on PC. So just tunnel it before you male the same mistake. Took a while to realize as well ><",0
"Since the most recent update, I'm unable to use and play the music on my Sonos speakers. There is an error message stating ""Can't play this right now"". Spotify - what have you done?! I can play some of the music from Spotify if I use the Sonos app but the options are limited (i.e. no access to podcasts) and I don't want to do that. Spotify - please fix the issue.",0
Just what you need and all you'll need for you music enthusiasts,1
"Please combine Stations and Spotify (matter of fact combine all the individual Spotify apps into one). This is one of the main reasons why I haven't switched from Amazon music. Switching between two apps just to hear a STATION is NOT intuitive. Also, it's a fairly interruptive experience.",0
Back to 5 star since all the problems are already cleared. It's still the best music app so far,1
Only flaw is a small amount of time before phone realizes laptop is already playing music,0
Rubbish update app its messed up at songs on my play list no longer the same as I has. It won't play anything I click on anymore it plays what it likes even if when using a play list.,0
If you like music you'll love Spotify !,1
The app switches to ads about 5 mins in and then restarts or moves to the next podcast in the list. Garbage. UPDATE: Half a year and it still randomly crashes and shuts off my podcasts...,0
"Keeps turning itself on at random intervals, like when I'm at work. So irritating, may end up deleting it again like I did before",0
Fix your app. It always crashes. I'm done paying for this,0
"Couldn't figure out how it worked as it's been a year since I've used it, but still a good app",1
I'm using first time this music app it's amazing music collection. Thanks for the making app,1
Great app. I love music and Spotify meets every requirement,1
"I can't buy premium mini, it always appears unable to connect, even though the signal is good.",0
this is most likly the best app for streaming music my one problem with the app is one time i got like 8 ads in row. otherwise would recommend 9.5/10,1
Very good app to find more underground artists!,1
This app is really good. I am grateful that this app exists. I'm meeting new bands through him.,1
"App is easy to use and has got huge music collection to select from. The music recommendations are also good. But, huge pressure (the ad count is much more than the songs played) to switch from free to subscription option... nowadays, I listen to songs already stored on my phone...much easier, much better music and absolutely NO annoying ads...",1
Cannot turn off without switching phone off and restarting. Gonna stop paying for it if they dont fix it,0
"Since last update, app randomly stops playing songs. I have to close it and stop it from running in the background, and reopen it for it to work again... for the next 30 minutes before it acts up again.",0
I love this app but it pos the song wuns in a Wiyll. Sorry ubawt my words. I am a kid.ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜¶ðŸ˜¶,0
I like it cuz it's ad free,1
"I love Spotify, but still there is issue with 2021 wrap, not fixed with the recent update",0
Spotify is literally my go to app! Love it!,1
"A lot of stability improvements lately , good effort",1
Still trash. New feature: breaking the current song playing interface.,0
"Shuffles even when auto shuffle is off. Raised it up but nothing has been done. Update, 1 year in and Spotify cant resolve the problem. Useless.",0
Wow Just amazing,1
Sick of this I have been paying for Spotify for more then 7 years now everytime I open it on my pixel 6 pro it says no internet connection which I definitely have,0
"I love spotify, my favorite app. Just wish could download song onto device from app.",1
"Spotify is love, Spotify is life. I can't live without Spotify. Thank god for existence of Spotify. I love Spotify more than my own life. I would sell my sister just to listen to Spotify. Luv xoxo <3 (Spotify sponsor me plz I don't want to pay)",1
Love the app but even my internet connection is good also the app tells you're OFFLINE CAN YOU DO SOMETHING SPOTIFY,1
this app is so trash. it is impossible to do anything unless you have premium and not all of us can afford it. Also i got an ad that was supposed to give me ad free music for 30 minutes but it literally played an ad 5 minutes later. There is so many other music streaming apps that are infinetly better than this one and most of those at least let you listen to the songs you want instead of randomly playing songs that arent in your playlist.,0
I will recommend u 2 download this app if u r reading this then u r at good suggestion in this app I will get every song and that type of playlist which u want I wanted a playlist which I didn't found in other apps but here I found it but the only problem is ad but not that much in each 30 minutes 1 ad will come which is not a huge but u can handle it download the app now now I will listen my playlist have a nice day bye bye,0
Good app but they keep making my favorite songs unplayable and they don't have autograph (on my line),0
Had Spotify for years on premium and had no troubles. The new property lyric feature is awesome! The only neg I have is the My shazam songs don't go straight to the playlist even though I have it linked but probs a shazam problem. Beside that happy with the app it cover legit nearly every song. Only a tiny handful of songs I couldn't find,0
"I love so much about Spotify, but the most recent update has songs stuttering, stopping, and all around unlistenable. For a music app that's pretty important. Sucks cuz it's one of the only apps I thought premium was worth it but now...",0
"Easy app to use and play your favorite music, lots of music to choose from",1
"Gets me all my music, from current releases through classical bassoon concertos, and much more.",1
"Pathetic update....Can't login to Spotify using any device now....OTP, Gmail, Facebook no login option is working..",0
Crashes April 2022. Ever since the update yesterday the app keeps crashing and shutting down after like 20 mins of play!!,0
I love Spotify because it gives you so many wonderful options to discover.,1
Very good experience. Could not load Amazon unlimited on Alexa but Spotify went on easily and I have been very pleased.,1
Everything thing is good just leaving the ads,1
"Used to be amazing, have been a premium subscriber for 3 + years. The latest update causes Spotify not to show the song playing so I can't skip etc. Will stop at random intervals so have to manually open phone again. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, problem still persists.",0
From last update music cast is not connected,0
Since the last update the app just lost it. The music keeps on pausing for no reason and the now playing bar disappeared. The app also forgets that it should keep operating if it's in the background/when the phone is locked. What am I paying for here?,0
"It's a good service, but the only problem I had was, I found that every so often it stop you listening to music you downloaded offline. Took me ages to find out how and why to stop this. When reading on online forums it's a common problem. It's frustrating to say the least , it's why I've only given 4 stars and not 5.",0
A few occassional technical issues with not being able to shut off music or music plays randomly. However overall good app and great selections of music and podcasts,1
For the love of music is the only answer for everyone in the world.,0
Been using this from 2019.. It's the best music streaming app.. the UI is user friendly both mobile and PC.. only complain is ad but if you have premium then all sorted!,1
Best ðŸ˜… but you should give some songs for free download plzzzzzzz,0
"Hi Team Spotify, Lately the app has been crashing too often for me. Are any updates on the way? Kindly look into it please? Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you.",1
Too much ads. I got 3 ads in a row and 2 of them were the same thing.,0
"Hello, i facing a problem sometimes it turn off suddenly and no pop up when music was on. I have to keep install and uninstall this app, and it kinds annoyed me sometimes. Please fix this bug. I was using samsung a73 G.",0
It's an amazing app for music,1
It's good but I have my data on and says I'm offline when I alr fixed the MMS port on my side in the settings so pls do something.,0
Will never use another music app. Spotify is everything I need,1
Waste of time there no song if you want to listen a song then search its singer's name that is always worst app for ever,0
This my favorite app because all song are available.... I use before gana but nothing there now I using Spotify favorite app ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜,0
Not able to play the song. When I try to play the song app is getting closed everytime.,0
"I used to listen for Music through YouTube apps for almost whole day before I met this app, when I moved to here, I got some great experience from UX and UI inside this app, everything's great and I believe it could beaten Apple Music (iTunes) popularity becaused what we found in here was so close to what we felt in Apple Music apps (In listening musics experience, UI and UX too) eventough wasn't the best in his line but at least we could find the same between both...",1
Plenty of content easy to navigate!,1
"Great music app, however, I've found that I've lost the control bar, meaning I can no longer control the songs I'm playing and have to reinstall the app to get it back :/",0
Everytime I install the app it opens it but it won't go to the log in page it only stays on the Spotify logo and it just stays there I've tried to install and uninstall the app but it doesn't work. And even tryed to restart my phone and check my data and it still doesn't work.,0
Half hour without ads and wonderful choice of music that I can blend easily!,1
"Well the music and algorithms were great. Now liked songs are gone from phone and won't play music. Says Playlist are empty, but everything exists on PC version. Been days, of long depressing songless drives to work, ugh. Please fix this.",0
"It crashes when I have anything Bluetooth connected, meaning I can't use my headphones. It opens with wired headphones or with nothing connected, but it crashes with Bluetooth, even the Car Thing crashes it.",0
Can't turn off shuffle,1
"Very good music app, by far the best. The only downside is without premium it wouldn't be as good.",1
"Absolutely love Spotify and wouldn't move to another streaming service. Recently the app has updated which has added a bug which continuously removes the music controls from the interface, only rectified by force closing the app and starting again. Please fix this issue!",0
A lot of songs good mix always find band I'm looking for,1
Spotify keep giving me HORROR ADS At least give me pleasant ads,1
"There's a serious bug in the current version of the application.(7.8.20.1261) No option to pause or play music from the notification bar, or the lock screen. Kindly push updates that could resolve this issue.",0
"Too many bugs, also I can't get the Spotify widget to stay on after a locked screen. I must unlock the screen, go into the app then change the song, pause etc... not worth the premium family membership fees. I have been a loyal customer for many years, now I think I'll change to another service or way to play music in my car unless it's fixed asap! STILL NO HELP REGARDING THIS ISSUE....",0
"In my opinion Spotify is a great app/software for music but the thing is that I have premiun and there isn't that much you can do in premiun except downloading and no adds and that's kinda all, they should add more things to premiun",0
High performance ,1
Totally enjoying everything u,1
"Stop asking if I want to activate Bluetooth! I do not! I pay $10 a month for Premium, I should not be bombarded with annoyance every time I open the app. If this trend continues many customers will find other options. I will adjust my review when this issue is fixed.",0
This app sucks. If you do not have premium you can not even choose what song u want.,0
"This app has great sound quality and is easy to use. I enjoy it. But I don't like how you have limited skips if you're a free listener and can't pick what song to play, the entire playlist just goes. I also don't like how the playlist automatically shuffles. What if you don't want it shuffled? Other than these issues and some pretty annoying but bearable ads, the app is great and I would recommend it.",1
"I LOVE Spotify... I can't live a day without it. You can literally enjoy Spotify with or without premium cuz I don't really mind about the ads when I'm listening by myself. But sometimes the ads are soooo long and we couldn't skip it. Anyway, I still love the app hahah<333",1
"I have been using Spotify for the better part of 10 years and I have never had any problems until now. Sometimes I'll hit play on a playlist and nothing will happen, and when I finally get it to play, the music cuts off for no reason and I have to start the process all over again. I have never thought of going outside Spotify for music services but that may be what I have to do if these bugs don't get fixed.",0
best,1
"When Spotify added the ability to swipe to add to write, it made it so you could queue ONLY one song",0
"i use spotify premium, worth it!",1
One of the best apps I've found for music. There's very little you can't find on Spotify. No annoying adds. Runs smoothly. Love it!,1
This app is great. The amazing fact about this app is that we can even listen to songs when our device is off.,1
"Great, but could use more!",0
I've had no problems and love how you can customize the audio to a bit,1
"Also there's no what's playing now button to see and stop or explore the actual episode you're listening to, and I got embarrassed at work because EVEN THOUGH I HAVE AUTO PLAY OFF WHEN I TURNED MY BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES OFF IT STARTED PLAYING THROUGH MY PHONE AT FULL BLAST AT MY QUIET OFFICE SO NOW I'M LOOKING LIKE AN IDIOT.",0
The app is recommending me to add songs that I already have in my playlist. That never happened before. It's a useful tool to discover new songs based on my playlist but now is useless. It don't even recognize that the song is already added if I press the + button.,0
"I liked some of the features that the previous version had, but it still a pretty cool app!",1
Really annoying i spent 15 minutes trying to go back to one song but it kept playing the same song in the play list and i had to uninstall it just to to back.,0
"Music redommendations given by app are interesting and the music database is broad. Simply works. Can listen to enjoyable music with less effort, thank you for this!",0
"Please for the love of God, fix the local music player!",1
Spotify is good the only problem is if you don't pay for premium then you will probably assume it's not a good music app but I find it way better than other music streaming apps.,1
After I emailed Spotify to ask them for my premium to be cancelled because they were trying to charge me for a family account and my daughter's student account (which does not exist because she is on my family account) they attempted to proceed to charge me again. Horrible.,0
"WAYYY to restricting! This app annoys me because its literally Forcing me to buy premium. I shuffle in my playlist and it plays a completely different song i havent put in my playlist Its so annoying that i have to shuffle in order to get the song i want to play cause if i click a song, it doesn't even play it. I dont even get the song i wanna play! I only get 6 skips per hour and the updates they make are a HUGGEEE downgrade. Im done with this app.",0
I love Spotify I like listening to music and Spotify has made the experience absolutely wonderful and extremely easy.,1
"It's amazing but.. I can't get to play the full songs that are on my playlist, like it's only playing ten seconds of the song I want to listen to, and I try to find my favourite song by Stellar but it just shows playlists of songs I don't want to listen to or don't know them.. 4.5 â­",0

After the last update i dont have controls on pausing or seeing whats playing. It just plays and the only way of stopping is to force close the app. Samsung user,0
Doesn't show the song that's playing I can't skip halfway. The tab is not showing. You understand?,0
"I can longer have my Spotify play on my phone if I have it open on my computer, I have to close the app on my computer or else it will just kick me off the app on my phone",0
I love to use spotify,1
Don't like how you removed listening to songs when adding them to playlists in the latest update.,0
Needs more skips for finding your music 6 skips r not another,0
Latest update very bad. Control bar has disappeared so I can't pause or skip tracks. I have the paid version. This is unacceptable.,0
"App not working after last update, it's automatic stop to playing song and out",0
"I took a break from using it so I tried using it again but now I know why I took a break. When I search up a song it takes me more than a day to find it because it keeps showing me the song I want but then when I click on it, it plays a different songs. Also I wake up late when I set alarms because when I use Spotify the song plays really late, and the excessive ads. I don't even care if you guys reply on this cause if you do you probably won't even give a real solution.",0
"Definitely a step up from Pandora, more variety, and all the podcasts are a plus. I used pandora for almost 8 years and I'm glad I made the switch.",1
I think this is the best place to listen ANY of your favorite songs,1
Gold App,1
"Aggressively asks for new permissions, insults you if you say no. No way to provide feedback or get support, even as a ""premium"" subscriber. A few years ago they wiped my collection of liked songs with no warning. Otherwise it's okay. I don't recommend ""premium"", all it means is fewer ads, you'll still be treated like dirt.",0
The adds are annoying. I wish you could skip with out premium at least,0
"Was amazed with the customizing and shared info how awesome the choice of music was, as sometimes it can be humiliating, it's more relevant. I believe in this, and music helps me more then words can explain. This is one app I love and recommend.",1
No reply to emails or tweets. Service drops in and out for the last 1 month. Looking for a better service.,0
"It was fine until it kept crashing. Out of no where it will freeze and go unresponsive. I don't know what causes it or how to prevent it, it's getting frustrating. Reinstalling the app does not work.",0
"Queue does not work, it seems it only queues the last song you added to the queue.",0
"Good for music discovery. Doesn't allow hiding of podcasts, so if you're a 18-34 male you will have to live with seeing joe rogan's face presented to you dozens of times per day.",1
"Very excellent app, Spotify extremly meet my desire for old and current music. I recomend this beautiful app for all music lovers. I give you 5 stars.",1
I seem to be missing certain episodes of podcasts. Cowards,0
GREAT!I love listening to music and playing my favorite playlist!It's a great app if you like music,1
If there is power cut and when light comes and you try to play some music it say no network connection,0
"Great app to listen to your music, all I need to say.",1
Fantastic! I don't know how I'd live without Spotify,1
Excellent selection of trac,1
I pay for premium and have downloaded so many songs yet when my data or WiFi is off I cannot play them!!!! It's extremely frustrating when I was on my flight today and can't play music!!!!!,0
Current version very glitchy for music playback. 10+ hiccups(micro pauses per song).,0
"I had JUST signed up for premium for the first time, switching from another service, and the app is almost unusable it's so damn buggy. Screw this, I'm switching back.",0
Since last update it's crashing non stop. Will only play one song then crashes. Asks me for Bluetooth permission everytime I open the app. Android 12. Fix this.,0
Wonderful experience with no problems,1
"It's yo good, I can't say anything to increase it",1
"The app is good, but the lyric won't show for nun of the songs",1
Simple and functional app.,1
Easy to use and has every song imaginable.,1
Spotify music is cool! Beside you making your own list of favorite songs It makes up special list of your favorite tones I listen to on one play set too in different ways then I have made up,1
"Love the app... A few small issues though.. 1. I find a song and add to liked, then look for the same song and it takes me to a whole different playlist Please fix.",1
"I have to close the app several times before it works... it lags A LOT... it wasn't like this.... I want a block songs feature too please, or a no track session when someone uses my spotify but I hate the recommendations",0
"I sometimes don't understand this app...when you search for a song you want to play it won't let you, there is only a shuffle option, and when you want to play the songs in your playlist or liked songs, then it also plays random songs you didn't even add.",0
"This was always very C grade (a kid could develop better) but lately it has gone from bad to completely unusable - play bar disappears and when playing in a car when you leave the car, the phone starts playing but as there is no play bar you have kill the app. Almost as bad as Evernote.",0
"Last update messed everything up. It overlays with all the other sounds of my phone. Does not show the control bar on top of the notification bar, so I can't control nor know what song is playing. It doesn't even show the control bar at the app itself. Pretty disappointed.",0
I've had Spotify premium for over a year now. Recently its started glitching and not playing as it should. It pauses randomly (on downloaded songs) and more. If i am expected to pay $12 a month for my music I'd expect to be working as it should,0
Awesome to listen to my favorite music anytime!,1
"Always pauses itself, gets stuck on onesong and never changes. I try and try and try to redownload, delete cache etc. It never improves. Does Spotify care about its Android users? It never, ever broke 2 tears ago, why does it do this now? Also app fails to work with sonos. Never connects when you need it to.",0
"Love my song list, so easy",1
The best music app so far!,1
Great for music and podcasts.,1
Really love the music and the fact ican pick anything I want.,1
Good,1
Good,1
It's good but I hare the 6 skips per hour..,0
Idea- your organization should make where it only shows ads after you run put of skips.,0
"Ive been using spotify for a long time , and i usually buy the mini premium , but now i cant buy the mini premium because its always error or unable to reconnect , please fix this. Im from indonesia so i usually use a 3rd party payment such as ovo or gopay but it always says unable to reconnect and i have to buy premium mini from the spotify website rather than buying through the app.",0
"It has every I could want and more,and Spotify make play list that I might not have thought of. The best place for music love this app",0
Please focus on music not add,0
Greatest app ever for streaming songs,1
Best,1
Guys I don't need add free music stop giving this amount of add... It's toooo much annoying for me,0
This app spreads COVID misinformation. They're losing a lot of great artists because of their mishandlings.,0
You get a good deal of unrelated music in the shuffle. I don't mind being exposed to new artists but if feels like the ratio is 3 to 1 in favor of the random songs.,0
Spotify is the only music platform that's goes the extra mile for both artist and listener,0
Nice app...... Can find any music I want.... So easy to use......,1
"Even when you pay it's garbage. Songs stop frequently, I'll be listening to a song and when i walk away and come back it's paused. Cleared out cache and uninstalled/reinstalled but nope. Still pauses at least twice every song. As I'm typing this my song has stopped twice. Not to mention the insistence to connect to Bluetooth share or something. Not happening. Give me an option to never see that pop up ever again.",0
I love this app. Everything about this app is perfect. It has a great user interface.Sound quality is better than any other music app. Ads are annoying though ðŸ˜…. You will get an ad after every song you hear. Other than that the app is super awesome ðŸ™‚,1
Good,1
"since the last update, when a song is played, the play bar at the bottom disappears",0
When i downloaded spotify it was so fun and good i made Playlists of my favorite songs but suddenly i can't play any music in the play list it just play a little clip and it's so disappointing how the app just need money to help me listen to one song you are making yourself the worst app time to go back to sound cloud it was fun while it lasted.... See ya.,0
As per me Spotify is the best music streaming app out there ! I've been using it since the time it launched in my country cause it's absolutely amazing !! I love it !,1
Fantastic! I love the app! Lyrics are helpful for language learning. Thanks a lot. Merci beaucoup!,1
Excellent selection. Easy to use and doesn't interrupt my other apps. Great app thanks for keeping it free. Makes life easy just like music eases the mind Spotify is my mind ease app,1
"I love everything,because the choices are many.",1
"Easy to use lots of music, still more to discover I'm happy",1
"The music stops whenever I lock my phone, this was not an issue before. Pls fix the app",0
"I started to use this app a week ago because it's impossible to use youtube with tons of ads. But yesterday in spotify I was listening 3*30 sec ads before I can play music, and after 2 melodies another 3*30 unskippable ads. It doesn't worth. I wanted to purchase premium version, but no - not when I am a hostage",0
Really great app. But it's annoying that on computer or pc you can control your listening (if you don't have premium) much more easily compared to mobile but other than that I feel that it is a great app for music.,1
"My experience with Spotify has been pretty good over the past years, but since the removal of being able to preview songs when adding them to playlists the app hasn't been as enjoyable to use. I'm not sure why that feature was removed, as it seemed to be helpful to a lot of other people too.",0
"Good in my opinion i think that you should be able to choose, what ever song without paying for premium",1
Best selection of music With a hassle free subscription,0
Great selections. Great sound.,1
"Oh my God new version is TRASH. 90% of the time it will be playing something but it won't register as anything playing so I can't pause, fast forward, save to likes, etc. Downgraded to previous apk until they fix this mess",0
Ads just because of ads you've lost 2 stars other than that it's fine,0
The sound quality is vary good The adds are coming in 30 min And many more things Nice work spotify ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
NICE,1
Super but some not have the lyrics,0
"I thought it was good at first, but I don't have the ability to play previous songs, and I can't even USE THE APP I want to play ONE SONG and it has me play TWENTY It takes 20 minutes to play because it is at the very end Irritating, and Thousands of people don't like it because of this. Spotify premium is paying for something that should be free.",0
best music app if you get premium,1
The lock screen for android needs an upgrade Edit: I forgot how often this app crashed on my Samsung. It works ok on iPhone. 0 Stars for Android.,0
"I love the curated playlists! They introduced me to new music I love and tracks by my favorite artists that I had not known of. I don't like that you can't download individual songs or just listen to all of your downloaded music as a group, regardless across different playlists or albums.",1
"It is a very nice all but I can't find the option ""canvas"" and I have the latest version of Spotify",0
Great selection of music & pod casts. Love that they support freedom of speech,1
Music player,1
When ever I search for a song it's say that i am offline but i am online but still it's show that you are offline ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
Love my music I've enjoyed the podcast as well I use prepaid card enjoyed my subscription plan even whenever I run out I still enjoyed there setup better than most apps.,1
This so sux I can't even play the liked video if I click it's going to change idk it's bug but I think it's not so don't download this. This app so super ultra sux app,0
This app is very nice to kidsmenwomans,1
This is the best music app i have experience,1
I love Spotify its great but whenever i put a 1 hour song and it ends it always starts another one and i can't listen the song for 1 hour but i love this app.,1
Bring back the music bar so i can change songs or play/pause. It's been glitchy lately where it will stop randomly or just quit by itself. Go back to the previous update. Otherwise would be 5 â˜†,0
"Love the app. However, I've been getting some glitches where the song bar does not appear at the bottom om the screen.",0
It's a good service and I'm on premium. But it's so sad to see there some disturbing content like Joe Rogan's podcast.,0
Great,1
I HATE the new update i can't listen to my playlist from the start and i have to hear songs i don't wanna listen now and ads!?! There weren't ads when i used it. No it's not easy to use anymore bc of the new stupid update,0
Pretty good apps for better quality musics,1
Annoying algorithm that replays things I used to enjoy. Hardly any divergence espically for people who only get music from the application from my observation. While this puts emphasis on exploration i prefer discovery to be effecinet. My understanding on this topic isn't high but is it not possible to create additional ones with different logics? Other than that it is a decent music streaming service.,0
"Can't keep track of podcast listening progress. Randomly starts playing full blast while I am at work. I am tired of being embarrassed, uninstalled.",0
"Update- love spotify in general but the app is super glitchy on phone and computer. It constantly turns off or doesn't show that music is on when it's playing Still true- Friends told me about this for a long time before I actually downloaded it. Now I can't believe I waited so long because the more you use Spotify the more it learns about your interests. I've made many Playlist and like many genres of music, podcasts and even books! So if you like exploring music this is super user friendly!",0
AMazing,1
Mobile app is pretty ok. The TV app is laggy.,0
I have installed in my android tv but whenever i play it the tv hangs and there is no problem with the apps even though i update the spotify on time,0
"I don't know what happend but I can't see my songs in the Playlist without editing and I have a Playlist of melanie martinez and the first song is crybaby, instead of the first song it comes in a song that I don't don't know, idk if this is an update but I hate it because I can't even listen to it anymore, I think I might download a new music app.",0
"After the update I cannot like songs or download songs and play lists... I have a galaxy note 8, I have been to the support page but there are no solutions to this problem... I used spotify everyday but ever since this problem I found myself using it less",0
I love the app but it's hard to put songs in a playlist when it keeps going back to the first song then you forgot what songs you added so you have to start all over,0
"Over ads. Advertisement too much. One song , one advertisement. It's irritate",0
I found my favorite songs and bands,1
"Absolutely loved Spotify when I was paying for it. Recently reviewed my finances and decided to cut some unnecessary payments out. Didn't realize how awful the ads were. Sometimes I have to switch to a different music app because they get so unbearable. However, Spotify is phenomenal ðŸ‘Œ with making personalized playlists.",1
Because I like it but when I want to play the song I want it put a different song and it's glitch so I don't recommend this app a lot.ðŸ˜¶â€ðŸŒ«ï¸,0
"Constantly randomly stopping, disconnects from my speaker or car, no longer stops when headphones are unplugged. The currently playing no longer shows what's currently playing and the play/pause button does not always work. The last update destroyed the usability of this app. 10/10 would not reccomend there are apps that work out there. The above review still stands 2 years later and the issues with an unreliable app have only gotten worse. Considering stopping my subscription.",0
I am using this app on Google pixel 4a and when I m connecting to my Bluetooth device it's showing data corrupt and the mobile is shutting down. Please do fix this bug,0
Great app and amazing wide variety of content. Ads are not too loud or frequent in free use. Price of premium is very fair and totally worth it!,1
Spotify does what I always wanted You tube to figure out.,1
I have been wasting so much time on other apps. I really enjoy listening and searcging for my music so much better now. The playlist that are made just for me by them are as accurate as a friend would know you. Love it!,1
"Only music app I use. It's great! Sometimes the adds can get annoying, but that can easily be bypassed with premium. All in all I love it!",1
"Today something good happend , Spotify gave no ads for 4hrs straight . I dont have a premium membership. Good spotify keep going",0
spotify is by far the best way to listen to the music you love to stream and its free and premium allows you to keep your downloads and listen to them offline with premium amazing,1
The now playing bar keeps disappearing! Have to restart the app,0
"Would get a better a review of not for their casting issues. Casting video seems to work for about 10 seconds then buffers for infinity, however casting my screen works just fine.",1
"Review has moved from five stars to one. 6yr premium customer, miss 1 payment, my account is removed from Spotify and all music lost. no contact number. Will be using competitors apps.",0
"Very specific choices when I'm looking for music, not left guessing or getting low quality copies",0
I can't use this app any more! Not only does it frequently crash in the middle of my favorite songs it glitches so I can't unlike songs and I have to completely uninstall and re-install the app. I then have to re-sign in just to add on/take a song out of my liked songs! It's a hassle and is so time consuming but other than that great app.,0
Every time you go to listen to a song it plays recommended songs you didnt add and I find that mechanic annoying because it plays songs in your playlist,0
"Really poor app. Constantly shows it in my notifications panel, even when I close it repeatedly. Struggling to clear the notifications on my Tab s7 and my Note 10 plus, they just return after a while.",0
"I really like Spotify, I don't have proplem with ads but shuffle and only 6 skips per hour is sooooo annoying! I neither want to pay for Spotify premium nor switch to another app, and this makes Spotify really hard to use.",0
The android app won't sync with the local files i have on my own phone.,0
Great quality of audio and also the fact that the team gives us a lot of flexibility like creating playlists and moving tracks to it and many more make it a sure to recommend app.,1
There's a free trial. I pay monthly. Works really well and gives you lyrics to most songs. You're also able to adjust things like if a song fades into the next and make your own Playlist. Love this a lot.,1
"Good app, i can put in any song from any human, never tryed downloading any of my songs, just try it, you be hooked, cheers spotify",1
"Used to be incredible, but the so called enhancements have made it almost unusable. Playback suddenly stops without warning, the app crashes repeatedly and its now impossible to refresh playing from liked songs or playlists. I really hope this gets fixed otherwise I'll have to look at alternatives.",0
"Last few months, during every song 1 - 4+ times, dead air for a second or more! So annoying and frustrating. I can't listen anymore! Have high speed internet and no other apps or devices do this! And it's at several different places, house, cottage, cars, etc. It's Spotify for sure, as other music apps having no issues. Need it fixed, or need to delete.",0
It's good but there are lots of ads..........ðŸ™‚ðŸ™,1
App keeps glitches and will stop playing in the middle of a Playlist maybe 10 15 mins in. Doesn't even show the song playing on the bottom of the screen. Not sure if I'm gonna keep paying for premium. It's Especially annoying during workouts fixes by re downloading but that's annoying too !,0
i want to subscribe to spotify premium but i don't have a f**king credit card . pardon my french .,0
In my opinion I think that Spotify its the best app bc I can listen to music and I dont need to have my phone on,1
App continues to ask me for Bluetooth permission despite me granting it everytime it asks. Problem has been going on daily for weeks.,0
I am so happy with the Spotify Music App. To be honest I would be lost with out it.,1
"easy to use, update many songs",0
"Have downloaded music for when I have no service or wifi as my work requires me to be in dead zones a lot. Sadly even though it's downloaded and essentially in offline mode. I still can't use any of my downloaded music cause the app itself refuses to load. Used to not be like this but past few months to a year it has been. Let alone shuffle just shutting off or the app just doing what it feels like doing. Fix the issues. Enough apps take ""bug reports"" but do nothing. Don't be like those apps.",0
it has very nice streaming quality and the playlists are amazing,1
I love this app Spotify is very very good app ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ–¤ðŸ’–ðŸ–¤ðŸ’,1
"I don't know what I would do without this app (although the shuffle feature needs a little work. I understand Spotify can see what I prefer to listen to, but I enjoy variety over listening to the same stuff over and over).",1
Shows an error every time I try to log in. When I was finally able to log in from a new email address it says that I am not connected to the internet. This is really frustrating.,0
lag when switching song,0
Why does it keep crashing?,0
"My experience with this app has been trivial.. I like listening to music with this app and I respect the need for ads without premium BUT, why must you keep people from going to a previous song? It's really snnoying and you shouldnt need premium just to go back a song :/",0
"Lyrics' line spacing after the last update became too large, previous one was giving a prettier look to the lyrics section. I understand the purpose (Make it easier to distinguish between lines while reading, maybe), but I suggest to only apply this large line spacing when there is a back to line (in the lyrics source) or whatever it's called. Now, there is that large space even when it's the same line but split in two due to space constraint.",0
It's not that good and it puts random songs into your like songs,0
Pretty good. Lately has been crashing a lot when I change songs though!!!,1
"Fantastic app! Great suggestions and created Playlists! I had been using another app, decided to subscribe to premium and so glad I did. I listen to a lot of different world genres and rare sounds. This app has been a huge improvement in my listening experience daily!",1
Horrible updater. Every time it up dates it will take hours or just freeze and not update at all cant even use it to download anything cause its stuck at 19% trying to update itself horrible app switch to stitcher,0
All my fav songs are available ðŸ˜Šbut few don't have lyrics ðŸ¥º please add them,0
They need to fix this app... it'll play without the play bar so I can't pause or skip,0
"Pretty good streaming music app, wish you could specifically select the song you want to hear from any given playlist like you can on the desktop version.",1
Too good,1
"What is up with free Spotify. I get that I'm not going to get the best version of the app but you only have 6 skips. The 6 skips are that bad but pair it with when you play a playlist it just plays random songs that aren't even on your playlist. So you skip those song but then the app is like: ""woah slow down instead of skipping try editing your playlist?"" And you can't edit your playlist because it's playimg random songs. And when you search noooo it has to play more random songs.",0
"Very good, but I'd love to be able to see a Top 20 All-time most popular for every artist with the total amount of plays.",1
It takes minutes to start any podcast,0
Awesome Sauce!!! Highly recommend!!! No Commercials!!!!,1
Your better off just using a different app because every time you try to play a song it just plays a random song,0
Swipe song to add to queue for android please! This would make life easier,0
The best app ever expected,1
Ye buhat acha app h mujy is se kafi faida hua,1

"It's disappointing cause I can't even play a full playlist anymore without skipping like before. Before, I used to play a playlist full without skipping a song and then just click the song of my pick,but now, I think this is the worst app I used.",0
Great ðŸ‘ no. Best music app,0
It's easy to use. An you can lesion to all your favorite bands,0
Great app tons of music,1
Decided to change music taste and got exactly the experience I was hoping for . Finding old songs and new ones .,1
"Please help me how do I fix this I can't open the app the logo is stuck in the screen, I tried restarting and reinstalling the app and it doesn't work. Fix this.",0
"It's okay, has a lot of selection to choose from. But, I have a liked list of like a thousand and I play on Xbox but there isn't a way to organize my music I have to queue it which gets exhausting. Other than that I would four or even five. Please fix",0
Great music app. Like it that new improvements come from time to time. Just want lyrics for all the songs I like.,1
"**Update: May 13 - Just downloaded another ""Update,"" but nothing has changed or improved. Still completely useless!** Last update killed Spotify! I've paid for Spotify Premium for nearly a year with no issues. After installing this latest update, early May 2022, I can no longer access my library, play music, or search for music. Literally, NOTHING WORKS with the new update. I uninstalled and reinstalled, but that didn't help. Please fix this immediately, or I will have to cancel my subscription.",0
"Love this. You can find anything and it is free. Tried other things but nothing like Spotify â˜ºï¸. So happy with it, if you haven't tried it you for sure should.",1
"I rate it 1 , becuase when i open spotify it always says that no connection internet but i have my internet:/",0
Doesn't allow me to play music from mixes on demand at times.,0
"Most entertaining and exciting,with excellent switching from one zoner to another swiftly.so many apps for music r there ,but SPOTIFY IS par excellence.",1
"When I open the app from Shazam it won't recognise the track/artist unless I manually search. Now the play bar keeps disappearing so I have to turn down the phone's volume and let endless random songs play until it reappears. Restarted phone twice, updated, problem still occurs. Now has cut out on my bluetooth headphones so all I'm getting is intermittent static. Emailed support. So annoyed. They can give a celebrity racist $100 million but can't be bothered to fix their own app. Ridiculous.",0
"Since this new update, when I manually switch to a different song, the music will start playing then suddenly stop and leave the app.",0
"Since my last review was deleted....long story short disgusting monetized app, since you guys make lots of money from the adds you guys put avery 2-3 songs (like 2-3 adds)....why block some futures under premium? Im sure u guys make same money from adds....uninstall and forget spotify exists!!!! ðŸ˜¡",0
"Incredible, better than Pandora in my notion and usesuch less battery...",1
"I don't understand why after selecting choice of songs, I can't click on the DONE button. Even when I try to use the back key to leave the page, it shows SKIP or CHOOSE ARTIST. I still cannot click any of those",0
"I am so annoyed by the fact that I was listening to my playlist and some random music suddenly appear, I did never search of that music nor add it to any of my playlist, is so annoying I really wish this bug get fix as soon as possible because it annoyed me a lot I mean a lot. Is a shame Spotify did not fix it",0
It's good but doesn't work with weak WiFi signals,0
Very easy to use get any band any album and any song I can think of I can always find it on spotify very pleased with my subscription with them,1
"amazing app for listening to music but if you don't have premium I have found you can struggle to play liked songs. but there is an easy fix, all you have to do is go to liked songs and click shuffle play. also you only get 6 skips per hour on songs so be careful but if you have premium you're fine. all around good app though",1
"Wonderful, easy and clear music, not hectic",1
Ok service . But it takes over phone. Starts up first over everything else when in car. Spotify lies about changing through settings.,0
Great access to all of my favorite songs. Unbelievably large library of music.,1
"Great, I used to just use it for music primarily but lately I've been getting into podcasts. Id have to say It's been pretty great.",1
"I always cut off promos before I start having to pay, most I'll do is 9.99 for a couple months. You guys provide hate content in podcasts, so you deserve no premium users or money. Remember the customers can make or break a company. You're free to have whoever you want, but we as customers, don't have to support you anymore. Lose customers, you lose profit. Simple. You'll profit as much as Truth Social and other clown sites. That's why ya'll had to turn to shareholders. They won't help you",0
"Sooooo glitchy lately! I love it otherwise, but this is frustrating! ðŸ˜¤",0
"Free music, and top choices, something not to like? Listen!",1
Best music platform ive had so far Recommended,1
Doesn't work well with the latest updates on Galaxy S10.,0
"When I click on a sound , another start playing",0
"i can't open my account, I can't open Spotify. My premium acc got into waste. Hope you can fix it soon",0
I enjoy the great selection of free music. I pay the monthly member price so I don't have to listen to advertisements.,1
"It could of been a 5 if only ther wasent an ad every 2 seconds that were 10mins, so less adds and more then 6 skips some songs trully sucks:( witch means when im in a bad mood or just in a mood to sing either adds keep popping up or the sung is lame and i already used the 6 skips, please fix this i really would like to use this app more often then feel like i would like to delete then redownload because of the adds and skips, snd the quality isent so poor it's been better tho, ty and byee !!!!!!",0
I honestly don't know any other music app that's even comparable to Spotify. I've been with them for about ten years and cannot imagine life without it. Truly.,0
Still the best music platform of the planet.,1
I like this app very much but it should be offline and I like it to hear without internet so I like to give only 4 stars,0
Every good for anyone that likes music,1
"My experience with Spotify has been great until just recently... Where does the ""currently playing bar"" or ""play/pause bar"" keep dissapearing to? Have to close the app and re open to get it back. Very annoying. Another thing that has always bothered me is that in order to remove a song from a Playlist you have to go to that Playlist and scroll until you find the song and then use the 3 dots to select remove from playlist. Why is this option not included in the menu while listening to the song??",0
Super audio quality,1
"Use to love spotify, was even worth the monthly cost for premium services, but taking away the preview for a song is disappointing,it was one of my favorite things, it made adding to my playlist so much easier, without this I won't continue my premium membership and may even find a new music app to use as my new main one",0
"Smooth easy to use. Keeps all my favourite music in easy to find ""daily mix"" playlist and it's very helpful",1
"CANT GET AARON NEVILLES TOP 10 SONGS ,WHY????No one in the world has a voice like aAron nevile H Why can't I hear his beautiful voice?????? Been TRYING TO HEAR HIS TOP 10 ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY, IVE GOT EVERY ON BUYING HIS CD -HIS TOP 10 FROM OUF FITNESS CENTER IN SUN CITY CENTER, FL. THEY LOVE HIM",1
I don't know how one of the biggest music companies in the world can't seem to figure out how to make their app work consistently. Your app is garbage. It only works 25% of the time. I can never pick up a podcast where I left off if I'd like to switch to music for a couple hours. Sometimes I can't even get the Podcast or music to PLAY. For a company this big... This apps performance is unacceptable.,0
Controls are missing.,0
"Lots of good content. The software is garbage. It freezes every time I use it; it never connects to the internet without my help; does not sync with Android Auto. Glitches galore, and it pisses me off every time I use the stupid app.",0
Great app for music and creating playlist,1
I can't even listen to music anymore my playlist does not work as well as all the other songs on Spotify.,0
"Used to work for me but it decided stop playing and it would freeze and now,it won't load and I get is a black screen and it says that I have no internet. Go figureðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸",0
What are the development costs of Spotify so far? How come it performs worse than most one-man projects out there by a long shot? Google music is becoming more and more appealing,0
"The songs aren't showing on my phone, they're just previews but on my friend's phone it's completely okay. :(",1
Oh my goodness it is really nice cz you get every music you want ðŸ¤ðŸ¤,1
Seems to be one of the last platforms that protects freedom of speech and truth!,0
"The new player UI is terrible, even I know that's not how to design a UI.",0
Best app for music hands down available on all platforms at an affordable price,1
"Too high of a price for the perks that it is offering. Regardless of using it on the phone (oneplus 7t, latest android version) or Desktop/laptop, whenever you search a song and the song ends it does not play similar songs after as it should. Sometimes when openi g the app, it says that I need to connect to the internet and I am not able to search songs. It works oly after I clear the chache. For these bugs, rhe price is way too hogh, therefore reviewing it as a 1 star app.",0
Fantastic a great mix of everything and anything.... Tunetastic,1
"Been very buggy since last update (Huawei P30). Play bar no longer at bottom of screen, crashing without notice, very difficult to listen to. Disappointing considering I have a Premium membership",0
The app is so useful. You can listen to the songs while doing anything n everything. Songs makes emotions more valuable. But I think they should decrease the rate of ads a little bit that's why I am giving it 4 for now but It will be set to 5 when the ad rate is deacresed. The song quality is so good that's why I will recommend to use this app for sure.,0
One of my favorite apps but I'm clicking on songs in my playlist and it works but after a couple of songs it plays music that's not even in my playlist and I can't even hear my playlist like bruh fix this now!!! ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸,0
Amazing music app all the best new music in the palm of my hand,1
the play button keeps on disappearing. please fix this!,0
Spotify was good untill they started the 8 ads in a row deal,1
I started using it recently...and I've enjoyed...until recently....I found out I can't play songs separately.......it's frustrating and I don't even.....pls...restore the prev settings pls....,0
Annoying amount of ads Ads pop up every 2 songs Rest assured spotify is a great app,1
I really love Spotify the value of this is so good and it makes me so happy,1
"Song/album radio declining in quality. Now radio function creates stale playlists based on songs you've already played instead of new songs related to the content you chose. Previously one of the selling points of the app, YouTube is providing much more service for the money",0
lqbal javed,1
It's an amazing app but sometimes it randomly turns off the music it self while i am writing something (texting someone),0
It always gives me the wrong songs,0
"Buggy, ads pause unexpectedly which means I can't listen to my music because the ads refuse to play. Podcast listening is a pain",0
I never seen this type of app it's worst app The app is not at all opening from first i didn't listen even one song also Pls solve this problem Spotify ðŸ‘ðŸ»,0
Spotify randomly stops playing and songs seem to stutter while phone is locked. It's days like this I miss google play music,0
I'm usually pretty satisfied with this app but it seems like we are no longer able to preview songs when adding songs to a playlist. I hope they bring back this feature because it made discovering new music super convenient.,0
"I've been using this app for years on a nearly daily basis, and it's worked without issue since then. Recently with this new update that's changed. Now I experience crashes, my player decides to disappear, the playlist shuffle button randomly switches to regular play, and my headphone Controlls don't work occasionally. Really annoying when I have to stop working to restart the app. It was perfect, why did you change it?",0
"Increase the download limit to atleast match your competitors, other then the download limit everythings ðŸ”¥",0
"Disgusting app ,doesnt alow you to play some of your favourite songs without premium membership",0
bring back free shuffle,1
Easy to get download and the music enjot,1
Premium Member for 6 years now; before and I've haven't had to buy an album again. Everything is fresh and theres always something new.,1
"Poor...30 seconds ads never felt like they last a long time till now. Especially when you're just trying to play music. I get that they need money...but bro...right in the middle of the Playlist? What's the point of listening your favorite song If an ads ruins your mood, hype and vybe just because you don't have premium.",0
"Genuinely disappointed wanted to listen to the good the bad and the ugly instead I got some other song and couldn't even select it because I'm a free user, what a scam",0
"It's quite a good app all the music you want and some you weren't even looking for! Overall, it's a banger and I hope you enjoy the app as much as I did!",1
"Watched a ""watch this for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music"" ad, hoping for an ad free shower. One song played, and when it was over it immediately played three ads back to back. Thought maybe it was a glitch, but when i heard at least two ads after every song, I knew I'd been lied to. This is the kind of thing I'd expect from YouTube, but I truly thought Spotify was better than that. Please, don't make me have to find a new favorite music source after at least 7 years of dedication to you!",0
"Theirs alot of ads tho, the shuffle is REALLY annoying, & I hate how we cant skip the music as much as we like.",0
just love the selection of music & love the addition of the Lyrics,1
All the music i can and want to listen to.,1
The adds are too much and im not paying for premium. other than that this is a good app,0
Best music app if you're a paid user. Although the podcasts are trash and get recommended on the home screen that you can't remove so it's really irritating.,0
Great place to experience your playlist and to be moved by them.,1
"It is very glitchy lately, the play/ pause button on the bottom of my screen disappears, and I have to close the app to pause music. Also, does not show on my lock screen anymore.",0
"BRING BACK SONG CLIPS/PREVIEWS FOR ADDING TO PLAYLISTS!!! P!ssed off... I FINALLY decided to bite the bullet & make the arduous manual switch from Pandora, MAINLY bcz of the excellent interface for creating playlists, and what do they do almost immediately? Take it away. IT IS IMMORAL TO TAKE AWAY SERVICES WHEN YOU ARE STILL CHARGING THE SAME AMT!! That was one of the main reasons I hated Pandora and now it's the same Fing BS with Spotify. Not worth premium, but no better options so here we are.",0
"my last review was about me not being able to use Spotify because it's ""offline"" my wifi is turned on and I have stable service. I cleared my cache, didn't work so I cleared my storage. When I tried to log in it didn't work! I know the password. tried logging in on my laptop it worked! I uninstalled the app, I place my info so I can log it it says 'logging in' it took so long so I sent myself an email, I press it it takes SOOOOO long again but all it says ""link has expired""it wasn't even 4hrs!!!",0
"I am unable to search for songs even when I'm connected to a strong network, either a mobile data plan or wifi. This has been am issue for over a month now. I don't know what kind of effect will this review have but hoping that the aforementioned bug is resolved soon. I will change my review status once this bug is fixed.",0
Keeps deleting my review for some reason. I canceled my spotify due to their low sound quality and switched to a service which has hifi and pays artist better for the same price. Very happy to no longer use this app.,0
"Outstanding vin YOUR field.... dev team esp EVA group,? ALL folded when our group of beauties showed up. But took til now to get all the shelves cleared of scratchy wax. Thanks for keeping dabwaves humming",1
NICE,1
What is going on with Spotify it won't play the song I want the when it does it starts half way through then when I type a particular band I like and the next song has nothing to do with the band I put in then after every song it plays 2 to 3 adds it used to be so good now I've unistalled and reinstalling it to see if that's the problem but if it keeps doing what's it's doing then I will never use the app again,0
They dont have vultures,1
Song all are good have good quality and all but even though I'm online it is showing offline and can't get songs while I'm searching and also can't get the lyrics bcs it shows offline,0
The pause button is on the left side and the skip buttons are in the middle... It looks terrible and I hope this bug will be fixed soon,0
Why don't we have feature to change sequences of songs in our playlist,0
"9.99 for 3 months is what the standard should be. No way will I pay anymore than that for this buggy, invasive, irritating and frustrating app. When it works 100%, its a great app. Unfortunately, it typically falls short of that mark.",0
"What a fantastic experience. All the music I love, where and whenever I want. If this app doesn't close I will never use Spotify again. Revert to ZERO ðŸŒŸ",1
Sound quality is awesome.,1
"Terrible UX in this app. And to top that off most of the time searching a song and hitting play triggers an ad, and once you sit through that BS, it just plays an entirely different song. You had one job.",0
Brilliant. All my music in 1 place all the time with me... what more do you want....,1
Great to receive Spotify app because it awesome,1
I like the music on here and I like the fact they kept Joe Rogan on here and cancel the Obamas. Love it!!! Finally an app thats going in the correct direction!,1
"Music. Lots, and lots of beautiful music. Glad I got the privilege to have this app :)) Oh, and also podcasts, documentaries and some others. It's actually a very good app, and would recommend it to flippin' anyone",1
Excellent app for music lovers with ease of listening to your favourite music anytime...anywhere..fantastic,1
Works great until it doesn't.,1
I liked it,1
Love it i totally recomend it bit the ads suck,0
Literally have to reinstall this app everyday. It just doesn't work. Probabally should end my membership. This is garbage.,0
"Last few days spotify has been bugging out, needs a fix. The media player won't show up and the app will randomly stop playing music.",0
This is a really good app to has all the songs I want but on my phone they only give you about 6 skips afterwards you can't skip a song,1
"Seems like the recent update broke it, the current song doesn't show",0
"It's Spotify, better than it used to be even, honestly... Im impressed",1
This app is amazing.but the problem is were listening the music after the song ads will automatically play,0
Don't download unless you're paying for premium If you're listening for free you'd only get frustrated trust me ðŸš®,0
"Every time it's time to play the ads, the app crashes. Also, have you all stopped giving 30 minutes of ad free listening, because I haven't been offered that in a few days.",0
Love it best music app,1
"After the last update, there are some bugs, the music suddenly stops, or the control bar isn't visible Doesn't want to open, it crashes constantly",0
One of the best applications for songs,1
"I have no idea if something's wrong with my Phone, but the new GUI is so confusing now, I can't choose specific songs on my playlist and it forces me to listen to suggestions, this is not improving the app in any way, shape, or form, please revert this back to the old GUI.",0
Keeps crashing and won't play my downloaded episodes without my data being on. Which defeats the purpose,0
"Great music or podcast streaming app. Would recommend because its easy and simple to use. I use it on my xbox and it makes listening to things easier, there are a few issues but it works quite well because I can even connect my phone to it.",1
"Incredibly easy to use, great recommendations, no hidden charges and no constant pressure to upgrade. Wish I'd used it sooner!",0
Ads are annoying but other than that it's great ðŸ‘,1
Love the variety & ability to create your own playlist,1
I can't copy any links to share songs.,0
"I loved it It had best experience instead of other applications. But after latest update, When I open it it automatically closes Please fix this quickly as possible......",0
This is the best music player I have ever had Spotify has all the song you like you can put them in your liked category and you you have daily mixes that you will enjoy that's why I love using Spotify 5 stars.,1
"hate it, where the hell did the skip button is? And i can't choose what to listen to . It always gives me random songs when I click one, and I hate the shuffle thing, I want to pick what I want from my personal playlist. I tried downloading lite and it was good for a while until the same problem is happening, am moving.",0
It good and all just I hate how if you don't have premium that they would play songs that aren't even in your playlist it's like mad annoying ðŸ™„,0
"Amazing music experience but two adds for a dumb premium membership, thst i dont like plus the app keeps freezing and nothing is wrong with my phone.",1
"Best app to listen to music, unfortunately some of the rarest song & artist that i was looking forward to listen sometime not available ðŸ˜¢",0
"Got Spotify for my daughter who runs and wanted it for Music. In the end, I would say I benefited the most. I have made multiple Playlists of Music and am a listener of numerous medical podcasts since I do not have much time for reading. Thanks very much!",1
"There's a new glitch that makes the play bar disappear completely in the app and outside of it, so it's impossible to control things.",0
It kinda makes the app purposely worse to try and get you to buy premium,0
"I find it incredibly stupid on how I can only shuffle my music and not listen to individual albums without shuffle. If I can do this on my computer with the free version, I should be able to do the same on my phone. Otherwise, I'll just listen to the full albums from my phone using YouTube. It's in better quality, too!",0
Nice music so refreshing to hear some songs!,1
It does not open and is stuck on the login page,0
I like Spotify and learning to never gate the system. I get my Gospel music. Thanks,1
"Using Spotify from 3 years and it worth every single penny, best music app. 100% satisfied.",1
Very inspiring. I feel blessed everytime i tune in. God bless you guys richly in the precious name of Jesus the Christ!,1
"I'm really not happy with Spotify. All I listen to most importantly is the podcast. It never loads. If Spotify isn't meant for podcasts, please kindly let us know.",0
"Most irritating app ever, I've never found as much advertisement in spotify apart from any other apps... I understand their will be ads in other apps as well but spotify is just too much...",0
"It's like every feature has an Easter egg as to how it's broken. Listing all the bugs I've found on this app would make me die of exhaustion. Update in 2022: Every feature has at one point or another broken in functionality for me. Still. Update 2022 (again): Spotify asked me to rate the app, so I continued giving it 1 star ðŸ‘",0
"You shouldnt have to buy premium to play an individual song, instead of it randomly generating a playlist and shuffling it into it for you to find.",0
The app is very good but there are to many adds,1
so good,1
"Still cannot run spotify in the background despite updating, despite having the option to play spotify in the background ON. There is definitely an issue here.",0
"Bruh why do u need to wait for an hour to skip? What's the point of that, it's literally a music app so why. This app is just stressing me out bro, can't even listen to a music without listening to an ad for like 30 secs. You need to fix your playlist why do I have to listen to many songs when I only search one, ONE, if your gonna make an app make it like it's worth it not an ad music, fix your app it's not that hard bruh.",0
"I enjoy it! It's reliable, has a variety from Joyce Meyers to Steve Harvey to Crime. I listen on my laptop and phone.",1
I loved this service and have been a paid subscriber for a few years but will have to find another service. Since the last update the media information has not been showing on stereo I contacted support who told me the new update no longer supports my 3 yr old over $1000 kenwood head unit. Guess it's time to try pandora!,0
How many millions of dollars before they can make an app not full of faults? I've seen apps spun up in a few days for something far more niche and low budget perform better than this. A disgrace.,0
Seems pretty good. I would definitely say it's better than a lot of the music apps out there. Definitely recommend it!,1
"As one of your customer, we got the wrong track while streaming and Spotify did not take action. How can you let hackers compromise your credibility and access your system? We don't pay premiums just to experience incompetence like this with your app and staff. We will continue to give bad reviews if you won't fix this problem.",0
"Best streaming app! Only thing to add is, that you can swipe right to queue up a song.",0
"Good music app ðŸ‘ You can listen offline or online and make playlists with songs you like . You can also find playlists and podcasts, I recommend getting this app :)",1
One of the best apps that you can listen to All the music lovers can enjoy listening here,1
I have had Spotify for quite a few years now. I have tried most music apps. I love music and I love Spotifying. Love Robbie Rob,1
"I went from giving 5 stars down to 3 because when I'm in the app playing music, the controls for the music don't appear. I have NO WAY of pausing or skipping a song. The widget for the app doesn't work either. PLEASE FIX SPOTIFY!",0
I wonder like to listen more western Contact English language songs song more then Reginal sons need more English songs New add more k pop songs good Hindi. Song recommended also,1
"Great app. Vvv questionable ethics. Id rather buy CDs than support investments into the war machine. Like this is straight outta Black Mirror. Yeah, no bye.",0
GOOD APS,1
Excellent,1
"Lockscreen widget vanished. I would love it back, especially when driving When reconnecting to my car I have to reopen app and force it to start playing Both issues seemed to start with android 12 with pixel 4 XL",0
Listening to 2 songs = hearing 7 ads,0
GREAT,1
"I use the app to play music for my dog when he is alone, since he has separation anxiety. However, every single time, I come back and find music is not playing and the app has shut down itself even! I even bought a premium account, but it does the same and I just don't understand why on earth.",0
Great way to listen to a variety of music anywhere.,1
"I would give 5 stars but the commercials are WAY louder than the music. It is extremely irritating and annoying to have to constantly change the volume level on my devices, especially while I'm driving.",0
Loved it for years but recently they added a multi control feature that was in beta and all my friends an I loved it well recently it updated and now we don't use it any more because it's more complicated than it was when it was in beta I used to use it at home at party's at work now I don't use it at all I miss it :c,0
What happened now? I can't play my favorite songs in my playlist? How disappointing..,0
Good,1
"You need to fix the bug that's restricting users from accessing the app with the ""No internet connection"" error msg. This issue has been going on since last month and nothing has been done about it.",0
Excellent. All options are available,1
Great selection of music and other audio media but app will stop play between songs or drop out during one.,0
I love this app so much I love the music and everything about it. The podcats I really enjoy it's really interesting.,1
1)Stop adding random songs to a playlist 2)Update the ui 3)Just add a play button on songs,0
It's annoying. Why don't I have access to Spotify canvas?,0
"Keeps starting by itself, but when I want to liaten to music the app takes long to start up, I have a galaxy S8plus it quick with any other app but this one, thinking of changing to another app",0
"Acting up, stops playing at times. Doesn't show that it's playing music but audio is coming out through whatever output...",0
Bugs and crashes when playing music,0
I mean its cool but I still have someone problems with it. When I look up a song it shouldn't take me to playlist with that song in it. I. WANT. TO. GO. TO. THAT. SONG. Also 6 skips an hour???? God at least make it 10. Or shortan the time of before you can skip again. Another one is that I can't go back to songs? Like what if I accidentally skip one I got slippy fingers smh. Overall pretty good tho,0
It is a brilliant music player ,1
I've left Spotify now . I'm sick and tired of not getting the songs in my play list and getting just random songs playing. ðŸ˜’,0
Spotify the service is great for listening to music but their apps both for mobile and desktop are the absolute worst. I'm honestly thinking about switching to a different service just because of how absolutely terrible their apps are. They're always crashing or freezing and I need to keep restarting. Absolute nightmare.,0
Too good,1
It's the best music app man. Keep the good work.,1
I enjoy the app but the inconveniences are annoying. Why is there no button to turn off shuffle on Discover Weekly?,0
I love having the music of the world under my fingers.,1
People have been sending complaints about Lisa's song Money being hacked and unavailable to play in some countries yet there is no one to respond. It's been hours hope y'all fix this problem! As a user of this app this is disappointing!!,0
I truly enjoy the endless possibilities of music at work there is no wifi so the wifi-less music is fight on time.,1
Dude. Been trying to open the app for days. I have premium and it's getting wasted ugh.,0
"This app sucks. It won't smoothly bounce between wireless and data streaming at all. Updating my review: two years later and still the same glitches, also get rid of the stupid covid warnings on Rogan's podcast, he literally just said ""covid"" and there is a warning on it. Stupid.",0
"Everyone who loves music should have this app. It's so easy to navigate around, create playlists and connect with. It even helps me get through my work, every single day. Love it!",1
"It has been an upgrade from our last service provider, pan something ?",0
"Lovely app,but the audio is not in stereo,and I am a potential premium member,I hope this doesn't discourage my membership.. please fix .",1
Spotify is saur cool,1
Good place to listen music but I can't skip over 6 times and it sucks.,0
"As of the recent update, Spotify constantly keeps crashing and is constantly running into issues. Sometimes the mini player on the bottom of the app will not show up, which is extremely frustrating.",0
Can no longer pause songs. What happened to this functionality?,0
"To many ads and when looking for one song... the system ""shuffles""! Very irritating.",0
App is ok but recently been having to reset device or reinstall. Playlists are quite narrow,0
Good for making playlists,1
Since i bought premium i cant see the lyrics in any song at all. Also some album cover from albums that i saved dont load at all,0
"Nice, excellent quality music effect, add more kannada and other regional languages and classical music also",1
I love this Spotif music it has all my favorite songs,1
"Again this app started crashing whenever I try to play a song, this is happening 2 days after the bug fix update was released.. pathetic",0
"I pay for the family membership and it's worth every penny. I don't have to deal with ads, can queue up whatever songs I want, change songs when I want, and the selection of music to add to playlists is practically infinite. Even if I can't find the exact song I'm looking for I can upload it myself from another source. An overall awesome app! Don't listen to the cancel culture nonsense.",0
Best app ever to here music,1
Good but there should be an option to speed the song up,0
"Love Spotify, I've found hundreds of new songs I never would have came across without my discovery weekly, just wish sometimes it could figure out what song I'm thinking of even I don't know the title or artist haha",0
This Spotify music ðŸŽ¶ app to good and amazing app,1
"Says ""Go online to search again"" everytime I try to search a particular song even though songs in my playlists and library are playing via internet but search doesn't work. Needs to be fixed immediately for a smooth playing experience.",0
i like it even not premium .. feel like premium in my Samsung Galaxy tq just download and enjoy,1
"I'd love to give 5 stars only if: app didn't constantly drop my downloads (so what's the point of downloads??) Also, if app didn't play ads over podcasts even though I'm a premium user. The fact I pay $10 per month and still get ads thrown at me is such a slap in the face. Not cool, man.",0
Too much ads fr,0
I love it after the recent update  it was unnowin but after some time I realise that this is good because I use to skip songs and play the songs that Im familiar but now I listen almost every songs from start to end  now I can say it is good for our attention span time,1
It's a great app to use on any device that you're using the future,1
"Really goodðŸ‘ you can play song when your offline. But, when I played my liked songs, they played other song that I didn't liked.",0
Two average-length songs and more commercials. I'm actually keeping track. TWO songs. Not even TV is proportionate in it's commercial to viewing ratio.,0
I only played my fav songs in just 1 week. It needs to be paid before u can play again ur fav songs. But im broke bruh.,0
"Gets 30 min free, two seconds latter I get an add. Also the songs are glitching by hitting a note on a song and then repeating that note for 3 seconds then continuing off where it left off. It only happens whenever I turn off my phone screen.",0
Just worked and great personal music suggestions. I feel my personalisation data are safe with the team in Sweden so it was easier to ask for what I wanted than giving everything to Jeff B. Thanks team s,1
"The horrible bug has been fixed, finally. Other than that, I really like Spotify. It streams well, it has all the music I like, there are plenty of podcasts I like and it connects with the devices I have.",1
"So far the was really good...but after the recent update it keeps crashing. I have tried all the possible methods (uninstalling-reinstalling, clearing cache, updating os etc). But nothing is working. I don't know why it is crashing in Android 12 ver but working fine in 11th vers ...",0
"Ot is amazing, and has every music I want, and if you buy premium this is the best music app ever",1
3rd class appp ,1
"Love it when it works. But the crashed on my new ultra 22 are upsetting. Random crashes, no bar at the bottom to click next or pause. Have had to restart my phone on occasion to make the music/podcast to stop playing",0
"After 2 months you can't play your albums, I tried to play my favorite song but the app played different because I didn't want to upgrade it,they won't let you play your favorites.",0
"listen, in what world does someone think that a paying customer should have to endure ads of any kind that are specifically put in by Spotify themselves (not included directly into the episode by the creators). get a grip on reality",0
"New review- I would give less than one star because it was already on 1. The update I made today is now not allowing the app to play songs in a consecutive order if there is no shuffle on. Also when I want to play a song it instead plays something entirely different that's not even in my playlist! The app keeps stopping, it just pauses the sound and I can't make it start again unless I force close the app and open it again. Rubbish",0
Incredible! I love this app!,1
Very good app even has songs form way back,1
"pls get yourself together, so much bugs, my downloads keep on disappearing out of nowhere. it's getting kind of annoying",0
STUPID APP!!!ALWAYS CRASH WITH WATCH ACTIVE 2(REMOTE).!!!FIX IT!!!I'M PREMIUM USER!!!SUCKS!!! Update:Now No remote function on watch active 2??REALLY!!!,0
Yo Spotify what are you doing to these updates?! I have a set Playlist and yet your algorithm think it's best to automatically put on a radio of my chosen songs. Especially when I put on a certain Playlist and queue up upcoming songs I put down and you reset that and choose your own songs. FIX THIS NOW!!!,0
Have to use data to listen even when I have downloaded my Playlist on my premium account. Have tried reinstalling but now won't even let me log in,0
"This app has so many insperation.it helps me calm down,relax. I love this app sosososososososososososososo much it is amazing â¤ï¸â€ðŸ©¹âœ¨",1
"I've been a Spotify user for over 5 years. The last version was great. Recently in the last three weeks there's been an update which has LOADS of bugs, which has been tiresome to use as whatever you're listening to the app crashes. The current song playing doesn't appear on screen anymore, it's the 4th or 5th to last track that appears, the app vlitches and you physically need to go into the app to click start again. And disconnects again after 30 seconds. Bring back the old version pleeeeeease",0
It never plays a single song straight. It stops out of the blue. Not sure why. It sucks.,0
"Great, very pleased with the variety of genres. Would recommend to my friends and family.",1
"I can usually always find what song I'm looking for. I've noticed some artists aren't available as well as some versions or remixes, but for the most part I LOVE this app!!!",1
I play a song and can't see the buttons for play/poss / next... Can't see what sing is playing. Fix please,0
good,1
Let the app keep the phone unlocked while playing or I'm not resubbing. It's dangerous while driving otherwise. And it USED TO DO THIS!,1
"I liked that your leadership did not cencor joe rogans episodes with Dr. Malone and McCulloch, when all other major platforms would. So I gave the app 5 stars. But now that you caved (allthough only slightly) to media pressure i had to go in and change it. Definitely a step in the wrong direction for people's freedom to think for themselves.",0
Worse and Worse So many bugs recently that the app is getting to a point where it is unusable. Why do you keep pushing out these updates without stress testing first. Your making more work for a team that already can't do their job properly?,0
Good,1
"I have used tbe paid version of spotify for years, and I was very happy with it. Now it is very unusable, the control bar disappears and i have to shut it down and reopen it to be able to control the music. I am going to look for another paid music service.",0
An exclusive set of songs with a personalized playlist makes it a listners paradise and a music enthusiasts haven.,1
Love the app but the fact that the lyrics feature still won't work even if I cleared Cache/data and reinstalled several times is annoying,0
Enjoy listening to podcasts while working. Ear buds in and listening.,1
I like Spotify it's great ðŸ‘ music app,1
I loved this until all of a sudden it changed the way I view my playlists and other songs and stops randomly even tho I've changed all my settings to accommodate it.,0
"I have been a happy customer of premium for a few years. However the app was more stable 3 years, and even 3 months ago than it is now. The player disappears at the bottom of the screen. This means you don't have access to the MOST BASIC functions that a walkman would have haha. Many ways to mess up an app, but breaking the ability to see what is playing, and play pause skip tracks and go to previous tracks is absurd.",0
Have used Spotify off and on for a few years. Always find pleasure and peace in my lifetime of songs. 68 years of music and it's all there. Kudos,1
Was about to get premium when I heard how they were treating Joe Rogan and bending the knew to cancel culture. I am now deleting the app entirely. Hope that Spotify learns burning books because people disagree with them isnt the right way to handle it. Will follow Joe Rogan elsewhere and will never download Spotify again.,0
"This is best platform for listening music . But it is glitching in many devices , including mine too in which it was crashing as we play any song . Mine got fixed now but in many of the devices , this glitch is still there and hence i give 4 stars. Developers should look after this issue or else many of people will shift to other platforms like yt music , prime music , gaana etc",0
Plays one song then 90 seconds of commercials! Deleting this app after 4 years!,0
"This is quite a nice music app, well developed and well thought, but I hate it that when I navigate the app offline, even if I downloaded like 800 songs, I can't play none of them. Like, that should be the perfect ideal situation the download option was created for. Even after closing and reopening the app several times, my downloaded songs won't play. So the thing is, I'm wasting around 4 gb of space for nothing. At this point it's better to get Spotify Free and not the Premium version.",0
"Yeah man, it's Spotify",1
"Does not play a selected song in my library. Shuffle play works, searching for the song and playing it from the artist's channel works, but selecting one song from my ""liked songs"" playlist does nothing. Paying for premium service for now, might cancel and switch services if this keeps up.",0
"This the worst music app ever. When you want to listen ""a"" song and they will give you a long playlist",0
I like the vast variety and the price is fair! But please add these features to your app: - Clear queue - removing every song on it is mind numbing,0
I like the app but I don't like that you have 6 skips per hour because I don't like sitting through a song that I don't like. knowing I can't skip it,0
This app is dedicated to music lovers and singers because audio very clear ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹,1
Hey can you erase that for me can you erase that for me let me start over day for me and I'm just going to keep thinking the best and I'm going to get that check and that's just facts and then I'm going to help and do it the right way it's just facts slippers don't count so by using this app it takes me away for the song and that's the best songs,1
"Great app ,however I am cheap and don't want to purchase premium, which is annoying. ðŸš¶ðŸ¤¸ðŸƒðŸš¶Flip",0
Experience been great so far! Really enjoy using it...,1
Its the best app for music ever.. i love it so much only one thing should be inproved that there should be less ads otherwise the app is best...,1
Not gud very bad no skip songs past 3 of dem unless pay also many ads no recommend but found some good music on so I guess is ok,1
"Great music app, pretty much the only one I use. Problem is it would crash every other song and make mad. Hope it gets fixed since I'm a premium user.",0
One word amazing Though it would be helpful if some updates is made to the sort options and if one can search for songs by lyrics,1
I try putting a song but it shuffles and puts a different one,0
Love the algorithms the team uses for finding new music. But the persistent unloading of any of the librarys or liked songs or even any content for that matter on an android every hour or less is ridiculous. Makes me want to cancel subscription before the 3months is over. Fix this. And I shall change to 5 star.,0
It's been more than a month and Spotify hasn't fixed the HUD notification for currently playing songs...,0
"I have to download the songs on PC, and save the cache at specific location. And when I try to restore the songs with same cache after reinstalling the OS, the cache doesn't work. Again I have to download the all the songs. It's the waste of my time, money and data, after paying all that money to spotify.",0
This app is disgusting. The lyrics are not coming for available songs also.,0
I can't play my own music from my phone unless downloaded songs why???,0
I don't live without Spotify,1
"Since the update, the player at the bottom disappears and doesn't come back until I force close it twice...very annoying. Please fix bug!!!!",0
Really amazing but lyrics in English have mistake,0
Great music. Easier to use than YouTube!,1
Great platform have to say. Wasn't a fan to start but really has made a difference to how I listen to music,1
The great music songs available Nice song app,1
"If you are looking at getting this app then I recomend getting premium if you are going to use it enough to justify it, the only problems you get are with the free version. The main problem I have found with Spotify is that Spotify adds random songs to you playlist and the only way to get rid of them is to hide them but this does not solve the problem, nothing does seem to solve it. Spotify needs to do something about this. I am sure that I am not the only one with this problem.",0
"I literally do not know why but while in school my spotify was not working so I thought I'd just turn on airplane mode to refresh the connection, I spam clicked it and realized my wifi icon was not working either, nor my flashlight, nothing in my panel was working, so I decided to ""force stop"" Spotify because the icon was glitched in my notification bar, and then all of a sudden my phone went crazy, turning on and off airplane mode, along with wifi, and flashlight, spotify shouldn't do this...",0
Love Spotify. Never let's me down!,1
It can be hard to find playlists that suit my musical tastes but I love how easy Spotify is to use and there is a lot of great selection.,1
I'm not using Spotify anymore cause they removed all the lyrics,0
I hate the new update where you can only play the full versions of songs on shuffle. It is really annoying please fix it. I will change my review when this is fixed,0
I really like Spotify is ah really good music appyou can choose your favorite songs and have them on your favorite list and you don't have to search for them,1
Much better choice over amazon music. Autopsy works wonderfully,1
Spotify is awesome. There are so many song choices and there is so many customizable features,1
One of the best music apps you can use no cap,1
All of a sudden the app will not work on my S22+,0
Spotify has a lot of music and comedy I like. Spotify has a large variety of podcast and music. And comedy I really love Spotify,1
"Love this app. Its helping me to listen different category of songs with different genres with lyrics. Like whenever a song hit my mind then i used to open this app. In gym, walking, traveling, study time, lonely and sleep time this would be helpful to enjoy music. Thank you Spotify.",1
So easy to use Love this app,1
"Very good intuitive selection of similar music based on listening habits. Easy to use, easy to explore.",1
"Yes, I am having the same issue with the app bugging out. The player just disappears and I have no control of the functions and the Bluetooth connection keeps going in and out. The app is just acting glitchy, pleased fix!",0
Amazing music app,1
"Got a new pair of Sennheiser BT earphones that use Qualcomm aptX HD audio, when I open Spotify and start the music, everything is fine, but after a while Spotify shows a notification that ""Spotify is tryng to play some music"" and the controls are not visible, even though music keeps playing, the only way to get them back is to force close it, but after a while it happens again. Not sure if it happens when i put them in the case for a few minutes and take them out again, are just suddenly.",0
Would love this app even more if they came out with a 5x1 widget to fit my screen and maybe song facts on already downloaded songs with no internet required ðŸ˜‰. Other than that I love it ðŸ˜,1
"The app crashes after every other update. It will work again when there is new update. Then there will be new update again, then the app will always crash again whenever I'll play a song. I need to wait for the new update again to be able to use it again.",0
Very nice but you put too much advertisements!!,0
"Fantastic app with Premium but feels like a demo without - Too many features are off-limits for free plans, most of which are available for all on the Desktop version.",0
Great selection of music with a lot of choices of genres,1
Downloaded few months ago still dont understand i cant listen searched songs so annoying,0
Updated cause my offline music wouldn't play and it does now .... however like many others now my music just decides to stop playing randomly like every 4 songs,0
"Too many ads , and what's with the lyrics . It's all messed up . You watch an Ad for 30 secs and you get free 30 mins except ads goes for 1 min and after 3 songs another ad pops up. Y'all be drivin it too much for the money .",0
I love the music ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ always on point.,1
Recently tracks started skipping and pausing when I have full coverage over data and wifi. I pay for the premium family plan and I'm on the verge of canceling and moving on to another music streaming service if this isn't fixed. ðŸ˜¡,0
This is a good app it's wonderful but I think it has a flaw which is that the songs can't be translated a Korean or Chinese song can't be translated to English pls help with that aside from that the app is perfect ^_ðŸ˜Š,0
Great app especially for podcasts. Only reason I'm not giving five stars is because it can be very very slow sometimes.,0

i don't want to hear the same ad in between songs.,0
Get 30 minutes without ads for free,0
"Love the app in general, but there is a problem with the podcast system. Spotify does not moderate it's content when it comes to big players like Joe Rogan. It will take down smaller podcast episodes that intentionally spread misinformation, but JR's episodes that spread conspiracy theories and even feature hate groups (is, the proud boys). While I do not believe in governmental censorship, Spotify needs to take responsibility for the content that they are choosing to promote as exclusive.",0
"Since the update Spotify has been stopping automatically after 1 second of play. Also, more frustrating, after pausing the play banner disappears and have to close app to rectify.",0
This is just amazing music app i love it!!ðŸ’—,1
Pure bliss of notion yeah its cintrivical motion,1
Is Spotify not working or something? My Spotify has not loaded or worked for the past 2 days...,0
"Im not paying $100 just for the ability to choose which songs i wanna play, this is a complete money grab and i've had better experiences with literally every other platform i used before",0
"Having the same issue as many others now where the music bar at the bottom disappears, you can't control what plays, the music stops if the phone isn't active, and the app needs to be restarted multiple times a day.",0
"The app itself is easy to navigate. While I do believe in free speech, I believe that what people say will have consequences, good or bad, and JR's past use of a racial slur means I will not lend support to him or any service that affiliates with him. Him saying the N word and simply getting a slap on the wrist is not setting a good example for people. We need to make it clear that in the present and the future racist speech and/or behavior will get you at the very least cancelled.",0
"Hey there, I've been using spotify from more than a year, but i am not a premium user and the whole experience on spotify was great till now. Now i am facing a problem in logging in and playing any song. Its showing that ""You are offline Check your internet connection"" But there is no problem in internet. The problem is in the app. So please help me in solving my problem. Thank you Shubham",0
Needs more lyrics especially for songs that are over 30 years old,0
Get rid of Joe Rogan! Covid misinformation and now his latest racist story was the final straw. I cancelled my premium membership and moved to YOUTUBE MUSIC. The UI and app in general is better too. Thank you standing by your racist talkshow host and allowing me to find a better music app!,0
"Everyone around us is safer when a responsible gun owner is carryingâ€¦ And TODAY, the Supreme Court of the United States AFFIRMED this fact in their landmark decision in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v.

Everyone around us is safer when a responsible gun owner is carryingâ€¦ And TODAY, the Supreme Court of the United States AF",1
Great for podcasts.,1
"It's good,and has alot of songs,though I can't seem to figure out if I can loop songs,if I can't then what's the point in using it?",1
Widget has stopped working and in the app it no longer tells me what song is currently playing no matter how many times I uninstall or log out.,0
"Used to just play what was on my playlist, now it throws in random songs I don't care for.",0
"I don't need a playlist for my dog, I need the app to not crash constantly.",0
"Very good app, I really enjoy it. But I don't see the option to download songs into my playlist. That I don't have to use data Everytime am listening to the same songs",0
"I like this app very much. World's all songs are here, I can listen Hindi, English and also Punjabi songs anytime and I have made different types of playlist for songs.",1
Forget this. Im going back to Youtube. At least there i can listen to the songs i want instead of my 30 ad free minutes being recommendeds of what i listened to last week. 10/10 do not recommend this app. Alot of problems built into the app on purpose just to pressure people into buying their premium. Premium in their case being a decent app that just lets you listen to your music which i shoukd get anyway. Total ripoff,0
Great app to listen bts song,1
This is the best music app I ever hold off it was so awesome I listen to a lot of music it's a really awesome that maybe you should update it some more in May 1st,1
It was fine when I started using it but now there are ads after every song not like it says that add free listning for 30 min apart from that its great ðŸ‘,0
"new UI isn't user friendly, at least give us an option to choose the old UI",0
I enjoy music on the app and there should be an option to download music but everything works perfect,1
It will crash some times but other then that love it highly recommended,1
Love the app. Since I got my new Samsung it's been going well with spotify. Thai isn't spotify's problem but I just hate it when I find the song I want to listen to but then it's a playlist. But beside that I love the app,1
1A,1
Absolutely perfect for music lovers and those who want peace,1
"For the past 3 days it keeps showing no internet connection when in fact there is internet connection. This isn't the first time but there has been breif periods where it connects and i update my playlists, but this time it hasn't connected at all in 3 day. I thought the new update will fix it but still nothing. Whatever you messed with in the app reverse it to the way it was last year.",0
'Now playing' invisible. Bug still not fixed after a whole day.,0
"My Episodes Folder makes this app useless offline. Every podcast I download is added to My Episode Folder, it happens automatically and it's much harder to remove than how it's added and undownloading an episode doesn't remove it. When offline I to go to downloaded podcasts in my library, but that just brings me to the My Episodes Folder, which won't load because there are undownloaded episodes in it. I can not access my downloaded episodes offline, so why have the app and pay for premium?",0
cant cast video of podcasts on tv,0
Fix your stupid app. It's been crashing for months now,0
"The selection of music available is extensive, and the monthly cost is excellent!",1
"I've had Spotify for a few years now. Love my playlists and the random ones Spotify creates for me. For ten dollars a month, I can listen to whatever/whenever I want...ad free. Love it!!!",0
"Well I've got 2 things to complain about. 1. There used to be this thing where you srarch up a song and you can listen to a fraction of it, now it's gone. If you wanna make sure its the song u want, or to just browse new songs, u have to play them individually, which makes it very uncomfortable. 2. There's no option to stop the app from playing SUGGESTED songs after it plays some of the playlist's. It's frustrating, becouse most of the suggested songs aren't my type at all.",0
"I had three months deductions of $10.99 withdrawn from my account for premium that I didn't get and therefore didn't use. Their 'help system' is not conclusive enough as they kept asking me for 'merchant numbers' which I couldn't get, and that's just the 'chat' tried calling them direct and got some hindi sounding man everytime who wants my debit card number & that's at the contact number. I regret the day...",0
"You guys are driving me cryz, i found great Vybz from your app. I also recommend you add offline playlists in case of network barriers and bundle depletions",1
Used to be perfect until I updated the app. Since then it won't work with my mobile data until i connect via wifi. It's been the same since then,0
"The Spotify is not a song, it's only contains ads lol. I mean i can tolerate 1 ads at 1 time, i just got 4 ads at one time lol. The ads comes out every single t i m e.",0
Great app for great music. ðŸ’¯,1
"Same issues as everyone else with it randomly stopping or not showing controls and doesn't seem to work well with Android auto anymore and refuses to play music. Getting tired of it constantly breaking, do you do any testing at all?",0
"Useless app, can't even listen a single song peacefully full of advertisment",0
"I hate this, This Spotify,now plays advertisement whenever one music ends I think jio Saavn,ganna etc are better than this. So, Spotify please stop playing advertisement whenever one song ends ðŸ™„ðŸ™Œ",0
"I won't lie, Spotify is a really good music app.. But that's only if you become a premium listener. It's really stupid to me that I have to pay just to hear the song I want when I want and to stop songs from shuffling into my playlists. And we can't play a playlist normally without shuffle. Why should I have to pay for functions that every music app should automatically allow you to use for free? Really frustrating.",0
I love everything about spotify especially reccomendations and ease of use my randomized favorites music list always knows what i need to hear and i have 500-1000 songs on my 2 accts,1
"Great app, but i does not like to work with Google sometimes. There's times were it won't connect or even tells me there is no speaker available when there are 8 i have, especially after waiting 30 minutes.",0
I'll change this when the app stops bugging out if you go back on a track more than like twice it just won't let you without clicking on the song again or or going forward and then back back to a different track and then back to the same track.,0
I love Spotify so much because there is so many song to chose from not just some songs and the rest are for V.I.P. I would recommend this=D,1
The ads are really terrible i don't want to become a prime member,0
Love This App So Many Great Songs Here,1
They just removed a latest marathi film songs album which I was frequently listening these days. The claim of 30 min music without ads after a long ad is not right.,0
So things have changed. The ui is way better there are some bugs that need to be fixed. But the app is working better,0
Always loved it. Glad I pay for premium,1
"Spotify comes through with the music but there should be a close button or something, if you don't force stop it stays forever, fix that issue then we good",1
Spotify is an awesome app. It's meets my expecting greatly and the way everything is organized so I can find things easily is so nice. 10/10 rating for sure.,1
"The new update is so annoying I can't even change the song when I put it on ""Shuffle"" and the layout is so annoying when I try to play a song I want it gives me a ""part"" of the song like no I want the whole song. Please fix this",0
****PLZZZ****FIX****THIS*****GLITCH****** PROBLEM!****** This app hasn't been working right at all! It's irritating me that I can't listen to my music. It plays a song then stops right after it starts. And then it says it's playing but it's not really playing. Idk what's going on but yall need to fix it.,0
to many adds on phone,0
Keeps stopping my music and not showing player controls,0
There is some bug which plays your song for a minute or so and then change the song by itself. Can't even listen one full song. I had uninstall it from every device including Alexa. I am writing this so that they can fix this asap.,0
Easy to compile playlist,0
Great for Playlist storage and easy add on and recommendations lists.,1
I've had spotify for a while and I've now started getting a bug with where its not playing the song I select I tried to install and reinstall but nothing changed is there a way to fix this,0
This is very fantastic app for every age,1
Very good it has most of my songs I listen too on there. :),1
Bring the songs from zee music back and I will give you 5 stars Update given 5 stars,1
The most recent update causes it to unpaired to Bluetooth and makes the songs sound like their skipping. It also doesn't show the currently playing song or says it's not playing when I'm listening. Currently it wont allow me to skip songs because it says it isnt playing. Usually I love this app but this last update broke it.,0
"I would never ever of, enhanced my musical brain without the help of Spotify. A truly exceptional music app. God bless Spotify.",1
"-May 08, 2022 I really love the app, it is very good indeed. But a few minutes ago I got a problem with it. My phone is an Android, I opened the app on my phone and when I did it showed me that I wasn't logged in, so I went ahead and tried to log in, but it showed a message lf ""Something wrong happened"" I keep pressing over and over again ""Try again"" but it doesn't work even when I tried to uninstall it and install it again, please fix it whenever you can, hope you have a nice day.",0
So annoying. Trying to play a song. I keep clicking on it but other songs are the ones playing.. not the song I'm clicking. Omg!!!,0
"Since I got my new Samsung Galaxy S22+, music wont play inbthe background when I play Beachbody on demand. Anyone else have that trouble? Aside from that, good app.",1
"Urgent Requirement! âš ï¸ You must add the ""download music option"" in tha application. Although downloads remain close inside the application. But it should me in free mode.",0
Been using Spotify for several years. Still a great streaming service since I listen to music everyday.,1
"I love the app, but about 6 months ago, it started glitching really bad. My biggest complaint is that the que changes most of the time when I stop playing music and come back to it. Besides that, I love using this app.",0
How has it been almost 10 years and you guys still cant make shuffle actually shuffle. It somehow gets worse everytime,0
Super,1
"when I go and listen to my music on my likes songs I can't choose but it also plays songs I don't even have on my liked songs and I just don't understand why it does that. I just want to listen to music I already know, not in a random playlist I don't remember clicking.",0
"Why, who ever decided to remove the feature to listen to music before you add it to a Playlist deserves to be locked up, this is my only complaint.",0
Absolutely useless allways off-line why?????????,0
Nice experience I can play my local files on it,1
"It's good,, but middle middle add's problem. Please remove add's. Tq",0
This best music player i never used before. Thank you so much created this player. I listen to music in this player.,1
"Come on, scrolling through months in liked songs was really convinient if you dont remember where the song is, but remember when you added it, also it brings you back to cool memories of your past and i also miss fast scrolling ;(. Please, return itðŸ™",1
I had to delete this bc it was playing songs that weren't on my playlist and I couldn't fix it,0
How is this app so terrible at maintaining your progress through a song or podcast? Open the app at the wrong time? 3 hour podcast progress reset. Or it starts playing a previous song/album/playlist when you've listened to numerous things since.,0
I'm sick of it cutting all my songs off at 9 seconds and I pay on time always and it still charges me 2 payments as well as saying there's no connection when I'm connected to internet so please get this fixed soon thanks,0
The newest update hasn't helped. Huge amount of glitches since then. Stops playing and won't play when press it again. Quick scroll is gone and a lot of time the now playing down the bottom doesn't come up at all,0
This the most trashiest music app I've ever download dont but anything from this app its useless,0
I like the app most instead of other apps but I'm giving 4 stars because of too many adds about Spotify premium but it's ok .. this ismy favourite music app ever â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,1
make it so I can turn of shuffle it's so annoying,0
It is cleared that Spotify has a successful services and its features.The app is over all nice one,1
It did work at first then after a bit it started to play up I tryed unstalling it and installing it again and again and it still wouldn't work I really enjoy the app its just playing up so I just stoped using it,0
"Love, love that Spotify has such an incredible variety of music, artists and podcasts. There is something for everyone. And creating, saving and sharing my playlists...Priceless!",1
best music streaming platform. algorithms are insane.,0
This app keeps on getting worse you only have like 6 skips q day it'd just annoying I have to use premium ðŸ˜’,0
Why has my playlist of songs turned to short video clips of each song only,0
I love Spotify,1
"Great app,if possible please add sleep timer .",1
Lots of amazing content .... and easy to use. I love the sleep function,1
"Good app, although sometimes at the beginning of the song it repeats itself like a scratch CD (very annoying). Also I would love if the Blend Playlist could include more then 50 songs, for more variety, specially when there are more than 5 people in the playlist.",1
"Awesome app so far,times my moods very well and knows wat I want to listen to before even I know wat I want to listen too,how cool is that",1
"After a update some time ago, the buttons on the notification are always black even when the song has black background. It's annoying but not deal breaking. The other issue is when I change songs on another device with my phone, the song changes but on the phone it gets stuck on timestamp 0.01 and the buttons to change songs stop working. Then I have to go back and forth between the main menu and song display to change them. Other than that it works.",0
Love the wide range of music offered here and I always look forward to listening on Spotify,1
"Very nice app for music streaming ðŸ”¥ But the only problem is ads , after 3-4 songs a 30 sec add always come Please reduce them Spotify team bcoz I really love this app ðŸ™‚",1
Its a good app just that sometimes when i press on a song it puts on a different song,1
Have all your favourite song playlists wherever you go.,1
When I came across Spotify I love  it,1
"Compared to the desktop app, this app is terrible. Bugs everywhere, too many extra ""features"" being added while the core functionality gets worse. For example regularly the play/stop buttons just simply disappear. Only way to stop the audio is forcing closing the app. This doesn't happen on other audio apps. ""Offline mode"" doesn't work, you could download something and get on a plane and the file won't play.",0
Spotify are awsome music app.because all songs avilable in all language.nice,1
Very Good app for music ðŸ™‚ðŸŽ¶,1
I tried to re install due to major instability. No now playing screen or anyway to control the music. Constant skipping. Randomly just stops. Now I can't even install it. Off to Amazon HD I go. April 2022.,0
"Kind of OK but lots of bugs. Eg when you start playing a podcast you'll get a little control bar showing what you're playing with play/pause and skip forward / backwards buttons. However this soon disappears (maybe after the screen has been off for a little while?) leaving you with no way of controlling the playback, other than force closing the app and restarting it. Guess there's a fair amount of content on Spotify, so deserves at least 2 stars.",0
I love it this app have every song and its so chill and relaxing,1
I don't know I'm perhaps I don't listen to your app enough but seems like everytime I want to listen to some music it's always turn to something I'm not interested in now I don't know what it goes and I haven't decided whether I should put up the money for everybody to quit pestering us with ads all the time I mean I know it's important but you know every other song?,0
Ads too much,0
I can't play my fav songs before the shuffle play,1
"Brilliant ,love this ,type in your favourites ,sit back and enjoy â™¥ï¸",1
Its good,1
"I love this app, it is one of the best reading apps i have used, and there are so many songs that make it worth the while, i just wish you could change the song when ever you like and not have to worry about only 6 skips.",1
Have been a customer for years will be disappointed if I have to change to android music because app is suddenly so buggy no player music pauses and plays on its own,0
This app is very helpful and amazing â¤ï¸ðŸ¥°,1
"This is for the new update. After 10-15 minutes of listening the app freezes. Another BIG issue is that I can't see what is being played at all and if going back to a podcast I can't just press play, I have to go looking for the episode I last left it at. Please fix this, the app was great before this",0
I've had spotify for over a year. I updated the app today & now I'm logged out of my account! I can't log back in with any of my info or Facebook that is connected.,0
"Incredible app, i myself as a EDM artist, song writer, producer and Dj love this place. Great place to start off as a new artist, and also a great place to build reputation.",1
"Use any music app you want to but sooner or later, you need to come here on Spotify because there is nothing better than this. ðŸ’š",0
"As a musician and a music lover, Spotify is the best place for me.",1
I hate this app when I tried to look up a so g I want to listen to all it did was give me other songs that didn't even come close to the meaning of the song I was looking for and when I did find the song I wanted it would replace it with a new song if I could I would give this app a 0,0
Relentlessly nags me to give it Bluetooth access.,0
Great selection of choices and remembering my listen to stations,1
I had to give one star cause I couldnt give zero  Just get YouTube music Spotify has made everything premium You cant even rewind songs,1
Only works half the time. Randomly stops playing podcasts. I have to go into the app and restart it. It Will randomly remove my downloaded episodes and make me re download them. To pay $11 a month you would think it would be a better app.,0
"Thank You Spotify, for supporting free speech and expression. Every single person in the world has a right to voice there music or opinion.",1
"I basically have my headphones on at all times, and spotify gives such a broad scope of music for a couple ads. Premium has been worth its while for me, and it is really just extra goodies like better sound quality and the like that make it all so nice. Spotify just works so dang well. Maybe 5 stars is a bit much, but that has been my experience.",1
Thank Ndlovu,1
Not sure if its just my phone but the app keeps randomly crashing and stopping songs every few minutes :(,0
Nice can play my fav songs,1
Love love love the music and that you can share your Playlist with your friends! ðŸ¤©ðŸ’•ðŸ’–ðŸ’¯,1
"This is okay, but the constant ads every 3 songs completely ruins ur vibe u had from the previous song. At times the ads become so annoying that I just go to YouTube anyways",0
"I love it but it would be better if you could turn off the suggested songs, because sometimes I just want to listen to just my playlists",1
Has a wonderful collection of music and playlists.,1
An app with an overpriced subscription should not have full screen ads,0
"Since I updated the application, the lyrics disappeared What happens...",0
"It's awesome. Podcasts, fav songs, Playlist!!",1
Has been using spotify for years now I really like this app Most of the songs that i like are on this app Most importantly during early days spotify got most of the thai songs tht other app dont have The interface also good However would be better if got some old songs,1
I like the app but while making the payment it doesn't work. Maybe this app isn't available in our country(Bhutan).,0
New update is completely broken I have to close the app every time I play songs or else I can't see them or stop them. Music will randomly come on too like it's haunted or something. Please fix. (Edit) it has been fixed excellent work! Edit again... broken again. Cmon guys,0
"It was good the first month, but now why I can't play those music in my library?Just a short song",0
"What a sad excuse to make me pay for subscription. This app is horrifically hard to use. It's like telling a 2 year old how to do things. You tell the app to play this song, but except it plays something completely different all because ""you didn't pay the subscription.""",0
Very good and good quality music,1
"I love spotify :D, but I got a new phone I forgot my password log in details, joys of mental health. :( But I tried to set up a new one and needed to cancel the payment in the bank I forget what payment was called but It wasn't a direct debit so I couldn't cancel it. To reset it up if I did I would block it for life. I couldn't find anyway of contacting anyone to sort this out and am still paying Â£13.99 through the bank. I am on the free service when it ends I will have to change provider. :(",0
I not possible to play music any bug going on,0
"Welcome to music...and playability,...",1
Great content terrible app. Gets stuck playing but says it's not playing so you cannot pause or play. Only way is to completely reset the app by closing it out. This happens nearly every time. Samsung S20.,0
"I used to love Spotify buh for for the last couple months it won't play anything. My phone is connected to the internet and every other app works buh mu music ones. They say ""no internet connection"". The only app to do so.",0
This app is sooooo cool and amazing it make me feel like someone is with me like friend with me and it make me always feel better!,1
I've always relied on Spotify since inception. An improvement would be staying on top of licensing so we don't lose those hard to find tracks.,1
"ABSOLOUTLY TRASH. THIS IS THE WORST APP I HAVE EVER USED... IT ALWAYS KEPT SHUFFLING RANDOM SONGS WHENEVER I TRY TO PLAY ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SONGS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE WRITTEN A HATE REVIEW BUT. Please consider fixing this, I absolutely hate having to pick out the song from the shuffled playlists, if you look at the icon it looks like there's only one song but there's like 100 of them randomly shuffled together... PLS FIX THIS OR THIS WILL GET DELETED... ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡",0
Worst App...most of time received e mail stating that a someone have logged in to your account even after changing password...and e mail id too so where is security of data?,0
"I hate it, you want to listen to a song and then you have to wait and listen to 50 other song before the one that you wanted comes up. It fills me up with rage to me honest I HATE THIS APP",0
"Spotify give me Always Running from Teyarch and Malukah and I will pay you money. This is an outrage. Also, I still can't filter different albums/artists. Double outrage",0
Nice app but sometimes it's gets lag and the song dosent show that what song you are playing so it would be much better if this lag wouldn't happen....,0
Spotify it works very well and I don't have issues with it buffering or anyting.,1
"I enjoy the app, it has everything you want. But I hate the new features. Why can I only skip 6 song in an houre, why can't I pick from my playlist what to listen first and why do I need premium to do all of the above?",0
Can you explain the limit of 4 pinned playlists? It makes no sense.. I have tens of playlists and i want 6 or 7 pinned on top! Why just 4?! ðŸ˜¡,0
"Simce the last big update the app has been absolute trash, bugs, crashes, same song on loop for no reason, loses connection.",0
Absolutely hate the change they've made to the group session. It was so much better where everyone could connect to the one phone playing the music - now it's forcing every phone to play the same music even when we're together. Change it back!,0
"Need my premium accepted on all devices ..easier .. why am I getting ads for premium, as a premium user???",0
Overall great. Managing podcasts could use some work. Would love an auto download feature and you can't sort your episodes by oldest episodes first. I also get frequent infinite loading loops on fast wifi.,0
Nice selection of music and them stories U share . Thanks for the music it's easier than in 1970' seeking music.,1
I can't but any music I want must get premium,0
Works amazing and I'm finding songs I haven't heard in a long time,1
Super,1
"This review is reactionary to the latest update (April 2022). App has begun to fail fairly regularly, not displaying the control bar while a track is playing, need to force close the app to resolve issue. Tracks will, on occasion, abruptly stop for no reason. Shocked the app worked seamlessly for literally years, just fall off a cliff with 1 update.",0
Most songs are great. Maybe I haven't picked enough for a better playlist. Many are repeated frequently.,1
Too many ads,0
I don't like how it's not working how it use to but it's an AMAZING app it's just I want to listen to a different song when a song is playing but it plays 10 seconds of the song I want to listen to,1
it does'nt let you choose your songs,1
"Updates downloads when I need it most, I work in a manufacturing facility so it is very hard to get connection and I cant having my phone out too much on the floor. Its annoying to have to wait on it working and feel like my job is at risk cause my PRE DOWNLOADED PLAYLISTS need to re-download... SHUFFLE DOESNT WORK. PLAYS SAME 20 SONGS OUT OF A 40 HOUR PLAYLIST! FIX IT PLEASE!",0
"I like Spotify and have been a longtime user but, I'm not in support of Spotify keeping content producers who are devisive, spread false information, and use racist vocabulary. As a result, I'm leaving the platform and will look to enjoy music and content elsewhere.",0
Great and easy to use. Only complaint is that on phone Spotify is much worse then on computer or another device similar to that.,0
Love it found so fs from back in the day. That I could not find on any other music platforms,1
Fix the now playing and Bluetooth issue. My phone is running on Android but it's not Samsung.,0
"Cool app, but there's a small issue, I get ads right after two songs; even thou, the app says it will give you ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening."" I get ads right after two song and the songs are only 4 to 5 minutes long.",0
"Last update sucks. It was working amagingly, but when i updated it started to show application error.ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ i really loved this one.ðŸ˜“",1
Beggar APP Irritating Ads Just For Premium. How many times does an app have to beg the customers to get preminum by posting ads just for spotify premium..I thought spotify for an International and well reputed app that doesn't need gimicks for people to use it. Great app..love the music BUT the fact that the ads Only ASk to join Premium every 5 bloody mins may infact discourage me from buying Premium.,0
"Great app, probably the best after you get Spotify premium. Would definitely recommend.",1
Amazing app.....loved it...just sometimes I'm not able to find some of the songs cover....it would be great if u look into that,1
After few latest updates it has become really impossible to listen to the song we actually want to hear it just randomly takes to some song and can't play full songs in favorite playlist like previously in non subscription mode,0
I love Music. This app is great! You can justly about anything you desire.,1
Too much ad's ðŸ˜ž,0
"I like this app because i can easily access into sermon topics, songs,etc.I recommend this app.",1
First you could choose songs from between your playlist and put your favourite songs but now you have to wait for you to listen to that song it's not how it used to be alot more things I would like to tell you but I won't I'll let the rating decide my experience,0
"Not working well with assistants recently Spotify isn't responding 90% of the time to assistants. Bixby, Bixby routines, Google Assistant on Samsung S22 and S20 Ultra nor Google Assistant on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 are opening and playing songs on the app properly anymore I have to constantly close and reopen, and even that doesn't seem to be fixing the issue most of the time anymore. I can't get it to work at all on the watch with my phone",0
This app crashes 10 times a day without fail. Fix this garbage.,0
"It is very bad now, it will stop after 1 song and often not playing in background. The notification bar player doesn't match with the song it is playing and cannot control.",0
It's a very good app for music. .,1
It is so good and Adam if you like playing music wail playing video gains you need the is apppp nowwwwwwwww,1
Thanks for adding lyrics to the songs you play.,1
Sooo many issues with this app and no customer support whatsoever do not pay for this! Many users complain about spotify canceling accounts in order to spread false news... like twitter. Xbox app hasnt worked right for over a year now!!!!! Does not play videos the screen just goes black have to keep closing and reopening and eventually maybe it may play... also get playback notifications when app is shut down and not even running. Watch they'll suggest I contact customer support who does nothing,0
"Hmm, so much ads, and if you are thinking you would make me buy your premium then forget about it, ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",0
App works great. Music is great ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¾,1
So apparently I'm never connected to the internet ever and this app is unusable,0
"Good app.. but it lags too much, and it gets pretty annoying sometimes.",0
"Easy to use, excellent library of music",1
"I use Spotify aton but the new update today is weird. I can no longer pick my song I want from my playlist, and I can't skip more than 6 times in an hour. Sometimes I listen with my family and a song with bad words will come on so I always skip. It's also strange when a new song comes on and I can't exit out of it, or replay my playlist. Can you please just go back... like take away everything you did for the update? Other than that I find no problem and use it alot. This update is useless.",0
Its good and all. But i wish you can download songs without premium,1
Literally worst app I've ever used can't even listen to your favorite song when you click on a song it takes you to some completely different song. This app is dog waterðŸ—‘ï¸ðŸ—‘ï¸ðŸ—‘ï¸ðŸ—‘ï¸,0
"I don't know if yall did a recent update but there's a lot of bugs this time around 1. Music will randomly stop playing in the middle of a song 2. When I click to play a song, the song doesn't appear at the bottom of the screen for some reason and I can't click it to change to the next song. I have to manually find the next song I want to listen to.",0
Amazing spotify has all the songs you will want to listen to and more. I would recommand getting this awesome app.,1
Any app that doesn't bow to the liberal woke crazy left has to be good.,0
"Why am I paying for premium, and now I can't access my Music unless my Wifi is turned on",0
"Does what it says it does. Ads are infuriating and only put me off of actually getting premium. Might've swallowed my pride and bought your bs subscription service if you actually paid your artists, but you don't.",0
"I can't log in, they emailed me a link to log in to my account but the link doesn't work. It says that the link was valid for 4 hours, but when I clicked on the link after 30 seconds of receiving it, it says the link was expired.",0
There are plenty of apps that play music. Find one that doesn't actively participate in the dissemination of COVID misinformation,0
"Buggy on Android, player not working, song stops",0
"Would have put in 5 stars, but spotify just contains to much adds that gets very annoying.",0
This is the app that is consistently getting worse with each new update. I'm a paid customer of Spotify I'm seriously considering switch to apple music 1.)App's startup time isn't optimised takes too long to open. 2.) It lags a lot for some reason. 3.)Also there is playback issue if I play something i can't see what's playing neither in the app nor in notification panel on Android 12 this is so weird. 4.)Also bottom navigation bar is not transparent with Android 10's gesture navigation.,0
Best music with out interaction by any app,1
Best music experience,1
Love Spotify.... I have used it for years!!!!,1
Perfection. I use this app as a student. I use the free version and I don't know why I don't get the ads. I never saw them in the app. It's an excellent app for a student and also for other age groups. I listen to the music to concentrate in my studies and listen to podcasts too. I think it's the best music app. UI and UX is nice. Till now no complaint. It has many tremendous features for free no other free music app gives you. You can go for it! Satisfied ðŸ˜Œ ðŸ‘.,1
"Spotfiy is one of the best music app i ever have and the only problÃ¨me is that on yo click on a song i doesent allways play the song you click on like what the hell i click on on faded (is a song) and a difrent song plays like heat waves (also a song) and you only get 6 skips 6 SKIPS like us broke ppl cant buy spotify ""VIP"" now adays 5 stars only 2 problÃ¨me i have with wait never mind 3 problemes why cant you just loop a song man so you dont have to sherech for the song anyways 5 stars",0
Any other Android users having issues with the app? I've read alot of us are experiencing the same issue after updating the app..once it's updated and you try to reopen it stays stuck on the logo....its trying to load up but never does! Extremely frustrating when you can't speak to a human. All Bots when trying to resolve the issue! Back to Pandora I go!ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”,0
"For freemium, I know yiu don't pay for it but on your phone it is terrible but, on your laptop it is wayyyy better. But for premium it is soooo good",1
Love the free premium although only temporary,1
Started using this app like a week ago and it always plays a different song than the one I selected. Have been checking for updates for bugs fixes but still nothing... heard its a great app but I'm not enjoying so 1 star,0
Sometimes the system can't handle me playing to much music and if I swipe app and come back on to try play the same song it just simply won't play! Else I do prefer it over apple music !,0
The best app ever thanks Spotify for the greatest experience I have with you.,1
Easy to use and good features,1
Useless app. I had a free account for 3 months and never used it a single time. Just use youtube.,0
Can' connect with my samsung galaxy note 10 plus with kenwood after update. It still show connecting and song is playing.,0
App randomly stops playing and play/pause bar disappears. App needs to be restarted to resolve issue.,0
"Nice app. You can download songs for offline listening. Found almost every song/band I listen to and that's not pop, but even rock, metal atc.",1
"Best management best collection system in songsworld , This is the best apps in the song appsworld... ðŸ˜ it is really good ðŸ‘",1
I hate the update when ever i want to play the song i want it switches to different song please fix this Spotify!,0
I love Spotify and I pay every month but the bugs are becoming really hard to deal with. Please fix.,0
Adds galore. Confusion between song and playlist. Give me Kazaa.,0
"Good for listening radio shows, dj sets. Bad ui, manage tracks/playlists hard as pain, advertisement is louder then music.",0
Wow can't even turn off the shuffle mode I just wanna listen to my favourite songs and I need to pay for it?,0
"The app will NOT work. Just a black screen with spotify icon. Have cleared cache and data, logged out, reinstalled, restarted device. No purported solutions work!! So frustrating. Support is garbage as well. Chat support has you do the abovementioned over and over with same results...Einstein's definition. Premium is a cimolete ripoff if it won't work on mobile devices!!!!",0
"Just switched over from Pandora and I love Spotify, way less commercials ðŸ’ªðŸ¾",0
What is wrong with ur algorithm of giving ads... there is like 3 ads after every 2 songs.,0
I think it's cool. I recently shuffled a playlist and every song I've tried to play has been shuffled on some list I am supposed to preview and like/dislike all before I listen to the song I wanted to play in the first place. That's been frustrating to me.,0
Great that it can be left on in the background,1
"Terrible user experience since the last update, select a playlist and it plays a completely different one under the selected playlist name. Buggin out badly. Paid for premium family for years now, sort it out or I will cancel.",0
I need lyrics but all songs don't have lyrics,0
"Since the new update my songs that have already been downloaded won't play more then 10 seconds unless I restart the app, and even then it's a toin coss if they'll work afterwards. This makes the app almost unusable for me even though I'm paying for ""premium""",0
"good app for music , recommend",1
"let me listen to different tracks on different devices, even if it's only on wifi. I play Spotify for my dog while I work in the other room, so it would be nice to be able to listen to Spotify while I'm working but preferably not the sleep sounds my dog is listening to.",0
For hells sake do something about this bloody payment issues man!! Every month I try to renew my subscription I'm redirected to websites and something or other goes wrong with payment!! It's really frustrating and very damn annoying!!!!,0
Spotify is great app music is great too many ads tho I would recommend mutify if you cannot afford Spotify premium,0
I love it but the limited skipsðŸ¤­,0
They removed the play and skip button on an app I pay $10 a month for.its literally unusable,0
Best music app ever...if u hav data u can search ur music but if u dont u can play ur favorite music free and the one in ur phone,0
Thankful for the wonderful music I can listen to. In addition to listen to talks too. Goes back to music we have enjoyed over the past years and music of our choice. Thank you for the selections too which are recommended. Never a dull moment with the wide variety of music. Further to my comment above I have the pleasure of listening to talks and life sustaining discussions on Spotify. WD recommend it ðŸ’¯ to anyone. Please feel free to use my selections. Thank you,1
this app is usually 5 starts but since this last week the app has been super buggy. Please fix soon.,0
Love this app. And love Spotify for picking up JRE. Will continue to have the subscription as long as you continue to support JRE and not censor. Thanks guys!!!,1
"its pretty good but when i play 1 song called ""the dirt""it glitches my spotify and my phone.",0
Spotify is very good but its just that I love to listen to music I chose but it would always play the extra one.not the one I chosen,1
I bet the next update will require you to buy premium in order to breathe while using the app,0
the app always play the less popular songs..youtube is far far better... if a user asks for an artis.. then play the songs frm the artist.. dont play other songs from other singers... and play the top songs not the unknown songs.,0
Best music service. PERIOD.,1
Got the app to listen to Joni Mitchell on long car rides. Apparently some shill is better than a foll icon though. Jfc.,1
"Playlists are nice but recent update removing ability to even preview songs when adding makes it a huge pain to discover new music, which was part of what brought me to the platform to begin with.",0
"It works really well, However You cant close the tab while playing it, Which is completely fine! Just thought id let everyone know, This app would be a 5/5 but when i play liked songs it can be kind of difficult when you dont have many songs! It can also be pretty Glitchy at times.",0
"I love it!!!! And Neil Young sucks anyway, the catalog is better without him. I read some other has-beens and some never-was artist are leaving Spotify because they hate freedom like Young. LOL I'm glad the fascist are leaving, well done Spotify.",0
I love this app! It's one of my favourites!,1
Great since you can find any song you look for,1
"The app is good. I have been using it for a , year and it work smoothly. We have all kind of genres and language plus also audiobook where we can download them. Which is for free! I haven't use the premium site cause of some personal reasons. So , over all i recommended you guys to download this app",1
Total changed from good to worstðŸ˜­ðŸ’” i even cant play my playlist youtube music is now even better,0
"I've used this app for 10 years. To say that I cannot live without Spotify is an understatement. It's so cheap as well to listen to unlimited music and podcasts. If you a willing to invest a small amount on a monthly basis, I guarentee you won't regret your experience with Spotify.",0
New update sucks Can't listen to podcasts I downloaded when I'm offline and sometimes I cannot start any music until I restart the app. Nevertheless one of the most important apps for music.,1
Great other than the ads,1
The best music app ... And surprisingly cheap .. not a bad way tho,1
the group session is not working,0
We just love it and enjoy it so.much .we take to our picnics and sometimes to friends places xx,1
Number one music app for me ,1
Glitching and stopping since the last update...Samsung galaxy 10,0
"The music is great but the service is way overpriced, if it was $5.00 a month it would be worth it.",0
"I like the app but sometimes when I close the cover of my phone or when my screen goes off the app stops playing music, I don't know if I have to set it somewhere or if it's a in-app issue.",0
"The only issue i have is that, i dont know if my account is bugged or something because i dont have the lyrics ""mode"", when i log in with other account works but not with mine, i tried all the things that moderators suggest on the web forum but still doesnt work, i have the app up to date. Pls help me and help the other people who also have this issue. Ty",0
Easy to download music,0
Unstable currently and takes ages to load up one's downloaded podcasts.,0
Incredible Music App.,1
"It has been really good. I kinda wish I could get unlimited skips without spotify premium, but other than that it is a great experience.",1
"Awful awful upgrade!! ðŸ˜­ I have Spotify premium and following the update, I can no longer see the name of songs playing at the bottom or have the option to stop, pause, skip, play, see lyrics. What is the point! It's awful! Please revert back. Or explain to me how I can revert back to the old version.",0
"Fantastic. Besides not paying artists enough, I love having access to soc much music, pity not everything is on here though. Do love this app.",1
Always something good and rarely ads,1
This is would be really good if it weren't for the fact that it randomly adds songs to your playlist with no way to stop it from doing this plus you can't even play the song you want because you can only shuffle play,0
I think this is the good app..i really like this app...,1
Dharmendra,1
"Before the latest update, I was really happy with this app but since then, the lyrics to a lot of songs haven't been loading. That's not helpful for my usage and I'm sad I can't sing along as easily as before anymore. I'd be glad if I'd be given an explanation and the problem was solved. Thank you in advance!",0
"The perfect grace in music. Best app for music streaming and podcasts. Offers a premium version with downloads, but free version is great enough. Great job, Spotify. ------------------A Tip---------------------- By default, if your phone doesn't have an equaliser, then this app won't have an equaliser option in the settings. In such a case, headover to play store and install an equaliser and then the equaliser option will be available in the settings.",1
"Love the app, but unfortunately they removed the enhanced feature from liked songs, it's available on playlists for me, I like to just add songs into liked, and I loved the feature it allows me to discover a lot of songs right up my alley, hope it's restored will change to five stars once its there again",1
"Love, love, Love Spotify. Great app.",1
Nice app to hear good quality songs,1
I love seeing the artist while listening to their music  Still new so Ill rate more as I use the app more,1
"Love love love it, always clear music and the podcasts are great. I especially love that I can listen to it offline",1
Very good app for a music listener,1
Current update is garbage. Controls disappear so cannot pause/play/skip at all - even using Bluetooth controls. Pauses at random and whenever notifications come in. Every single update makes this worse.,0
Latest update broke spotify on my phone. No longer shows up on my lock screen when playing music. Sometimes I cannot view the song thats playing in app... fairly often music will just pause too.,0
So many ads,0
A stream of Success Amen,1
My spotify app is always crashing. I can't play even a single song. Someone please look into this.,0
"Its a music app that works well on PC or phones, and other then an ad every 30 minutes or so it's great.",1
I can't select the music Iwant to listen to with out premium and IM NOT GOING TO PAY FOR PREMIUM,0
Can't control the enhanced list. When sharing a session on same network with other users can create IP conflict if the host session finishes,0
I love,1
"Great App, VERY easy to use the only thing I wish it had were LYRICS! They use to have lyrics in the past with Spotify at least a little bit but would be nice if full lyrics were available. I'd pay a little extra for the option. Just saying ðŸ‘€ Most songs have lyrics now! I appreciate the update. Look forward to seeing what new features you add in the future",1
How can u play the song without cellular data,0
"Complete garbage. Can't listen on my smartwatch, won't let me play the song i wanna, every album is just a mixture of songs affiliations with the artist. Was good but now it's trash. Do better",0
In my time using Spotify it has only gotten more buggy. Over a year later and my review stands.,0
Best music app available ( for discover music). But there still a lot of areas to improve.,1
"This last 6 months, the app has been crashing and/or freezing daily requiring a forced stop. I have tried reinstalling, bit the issue persists. Very annoying.",0
It has a good selection of music but it just adds like 20 songs to my Playlist that I didn't add and then I can't even skip them,1
"Really enjoy the flexibility of listening to the type of music I like, when I like.",1
I'm giving 4 stars because of everything. And 1 star less because Spotify needs to get a streamlined interface on Android. It should provide better viewing experience by improving the UI of the application in terms of alignment to Android 10 and later versions. It should be improved from the upper as well lower hands of the application as it looks separate from OS and not streamlined. Also it should be more smooth at some points in the app.,0
This is my favorite app because there are available all kinds of song,1
Enjoyable App Keep it up guys,1
It says that if u watch a short ad it would give u 30 mins of interrupted listing but it gives ad every time a song end and its kind of annoyin to be honest 1/10 alot of people font have the money to buy the premium.,0
I really love this app it has a lot of good music and podcasts my experience here is very legit and amazing I really like this app but I dont like the update they have here now,1
Last few updates seem to have broken multiple features. Music more likely to randomly pause. Player bar no longer appears until I restart the app. Syncing between devices is also buggy.,0
Brilliant music experience.,1
"Best mobile streaming service, hands down.",0
It's a good app it has a lot of songs that I love.... but it doesn't let me see the song playing and it makes it really hard to pause the song or go to a different song.,0
NICE,1
It was good but not is says I'm not connected to the internet witch isint true iv restarted my phone and the app twice as well as the internet and it's not fixed and I'm payed for premium but can't play any songs not downloaded making it worth noting fix this now,0
"I have bought premium subscription but this doesn't help with bugs. The play bar is dissapearing, it's impossible to stop music, to understand what is playing or to skip. Very annoying. As i got this is more common on android.",0
"Spotify on top, Apple needs to do better",0
Why is my app not telling me im playin music. I have not control on music just able to hit the play buttum. It has been a problem for over 3 years now.,0
"Great Music App, but for some reason after a while of using it, it plays the music but shows the UI as if nothing is playing",0
"Music selection ok, but gets repetitive and only seems to stick to a relatively limited selection of songs by any particular artist (unless you listen to a playlist that is purely that artist). The most annoying thing is that the ads are significantly louder than the music, intrusive, patronising (especially Spotify's own ads) and excessive. There is also no way to customise ads. I get ads are necessary, but I will NEVER give money to this company given their obnoxious and abusive ad tactics.",0
Love spotify cause I'm able to make my music list and share it with my friends,1
Been using Spotify for a decade or so and get nostalgic with some of the songs I've started from back in the day. Thanks Spotify,1
Great mix of music on their stations!,1
"It's makes my life funner. Enhances my fun mode. It also brings joy to my friends and others ðŸ˜Š. Thank you for the service you provide. Heads up, you're better than pandora.",1
Normally would've given this app 5 stars but I didn't because of the following reason: -Apps are supposed to be better than the web version but not with this app. The shuffle option is very frustrating to deal with when you just want to listen to one song on mobile. You'll have to go through multiple songs just to listen to the one song you wanted to listen to. What doesn't make sense is why I don't have this issue on my tablet but I do on my phone. Can't loop either. Please fix this issue.,0
"Declining, the app was great a few months ago. I'm now missing features like the now playing bar, and when the Bluetooth disconnects in the car the songs no longer pause, The mixes are now becoming very repetitive where they used to be all varied. Please roll back the version and bring back these features",0
THIS IS THE BEST STREAMING APP EVER tho before when I downloaded Spotify and I played a song it plays another song it was actually dumb Which made me move to yt but I came back again and it was gone :D so mabey this problem still exists for others so I would recommend trying to fix that,0
"I absolutely love spotify. I have been with them for years, and out of all the entertainment apps out there, Spotify by far is the best.",1
Nice experience while driving my bike with headphones ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ§ very good man keep it up u r doing great job I like playlist about songs album,1
My daily routine is dry without Spotify. Spotify is my monsoon.ðŸ˜€,0
"About recent bugs Fix your app Spotify, I pay for this, the not playing bug is really annoying, and it dropped out with this update!!! I swear I'll be going to alternative apps...",0
"Amazing! I've only been using Spotify for around a year but it is ðŸ…°ï¸â“‚ï¸ðŸ…°ï¸Zâ„¹ï¸NG! Thank you for making this a thing, everyone!The only thing is the ads but I still give it five stars!!",1
Spotify very nice one proqram,1
Currently playing and media controls keep dissappearing for at least 2 weeks,0
Crashes all the time after exiting the app.,0
"This app is good in some ways The choice of music is great, but I hate how if you don't have 15 songs in your playlist then spotify will put songs you don't even like in there for you. Also I cant leave my playlist on without it switching to a random song I've never heard or put on my playlist after like 30 minutes of listening. You can just make a playlist on YouTube with your favorite songs on it and none of this would happen. Not an amazing app.",0
"Glitchy, ESPECIALLY their highly invasive Bluetooth functions! Like, you-need-to-reinstall-because-the-play/pause/next-functions-all-fail glitchy. Also, they don't pay artists despite the high subscription fees.",0
Excellent sound effect,1
Recent update causes the player controls to drop occasionally and it keeps prompting for allowing bluetooth even though I set it for allow access everytime it asks.,0
Love the app <33 music makes me feel free and this app has a lot of music!!! It's like free therapy,1
I would literally DIE if I didn't have my premium... Been using this for almost 12yrs and have discovered so much beautiful music thank you Spotify if I didn't have my doggo you'd be my best friend!,1
"I use Spotify daily and recently decided I wanted to use it's car mode since Android Auto is no longer available for use on your phone. Pretty disappointed to see that car/driving mode is gone on Spotify, especially considering the Car Thing is only available in the US. I get wanting to incentivize people to get the Car Thing but it doesn't make sense to remove a feature for everyone else.",0
"Since some update came, spotify has been messed up. It does not show the song being played and only way to make it stop is to stop the whole app.",0
Spotify caters to the music I enjoy. It is consistent. I like that.,1
"When I choose one song, you play another songI hope this defect is fixed.",0
No. I loved Spotify. But now u made it so I can't listen to songs individually. And u added songs to my playlist. I need to listen to red (taylors version) in the CORRECT order. I'm not going from all too well to nothing new. That's songs away. And the fact that it goes to different artists. Just no. I'm not having it show up on my wrapped this yearðŸ˜­ I just wanna listen to rwylm and ittg bc it's a year old now.,0
"Best choices of music along with lyrics, highly recommend it",1
This is the best i have ever seen,1
Glitchy and not very intuitive to the songs I dislike as it will play them in all suggested lists even after I have removed them multiple times. Terrible experience. Lucky you have Rogan otherwise it's ðŸ’©,0
"I've been using Spotify for more than 6 years now. But after this new update, Everytime I play the music it will auto close and goes to home screen and not be able to played music in my phone, i am frustrated. I've tried to log out log in, uninstalled and install it back nothing able to make it play again. This happens after i updated spotify.",0
Samikhadiris,1
Fine,1
Terrible in app experience. No playlist selection can make up for the UI.,0
I think Spotify is the best music app,1
"I've been paying (money coming straight out of my account) for 3 months and the app hasn't work on any of my devices. Tried getting help from the support, absolutely no help, and I cancelled my account last month and it's still active and trying to charge me. I liked the app and worked fine untill they did an update on it a few months ago and now this has turned into trash. And you can't talk to an actual person... EVER!",0
"This app is great, but one thing I hate WITH A PASSIONðŸ¤¬ is that you can't view the playlists you made separately from playlists you follow or download. I can't express how stupid that is, like it should be one of the first things you'd be able to do, separate your playlists with followed playlists. Come on. It eats me up. I don't know why it bothers me so much, but it does. 4 stars. Everything else is amazing.",1
Had a login on my Spotify so I changed the password and logged out of all accounts and it let me log back in on my laptop but for some reason it's just stuck on the logo screen on my phone and a lot of other people have that problem if they log out. Not really sure what to do. I uninstalled it and restarted my phone and it didn't work either.,0
Good to listen even if you dont have premium,1
"It's okay, not great, not terrible, very okay, a bit janky on Android, sometimes stops working when I lock my screen, or just stops playing. Bit dissapointing for a paid service. The general UI experience is also weak, it'd be cool for a free app made by some stoner kids, but not a premium paid-for music service. Also no Raspberry Pi OS (ARM64 support is really REALLY quite lame.)",0
Hate new format. A lot of times my downloads won't load when I'm not in service or wifi. Defeats the purpose. Podcasts will pause every 15 minutes for no reason and then will say I finished the podcast when im not. Little bar at the bottom thats supposed to show what's playing gets stuck on an old podcast/song and is useless. Expect more for paying for a service. Going back to Google for podcasts,0
"I'm on android and its become so buggy lately. App just crashing, screens not loading. The worst is the play bar just straight up disappearing. I cannot play or pause or use the song slider. Sometimes even refreshing the app doesn't fix this. Been a premium user for years and never had any problems until now, so please fix this soon.",0
Best music experience ever you can find all the music you like . I love it â¤ï¸,1
Nice job,1
Amazing application for listening to premium quality music,1
'Music is a therapy and spotify is the best therapist'.....â¤ï¸âœ¨ðŸ‘‘,1
It has this new update which I do not like I can't play the songs that I like FIX THIS PLEASE I JUST WANNA LISTEN TO MY PLAYLIST the songs that plays aren't even from my playlist,0
"If I close Spotify, I expect it to remove itself from my notification bar. It no longer does that, making me accidentally cut music back on when I'm removing my Bluetooth. I've been having this issue for months. Please fix it.",0
I love it but you should include a rewards program for people who rate 5 stars and use the app daily or very often ( just a good idea),1
"15 Apr 2022 update: the buttons disappear so you start playing something then it becomes impossible to pause, like or skip tracks without restarting the app. Something is obviously broken in a recent update. Spotify has been so buggy for most of the time I've had it. When I get time I'll seriously look at cancelling premium and switching to a competitor.",0
"I am in love with this app, higly recommend it. Although the past few months the app has been slow to load, regular crashes and some features stop working smoothly. The new layout with the play button on the left is awfull and aesthetically irritating. Other than that, it is a great streaming service.",0
"Starts song radio randomly when listening to liked music, like its not necessary to do that, especially when im expecting a song to play next and then some random song comes on",0
Spotify is my favorite music app,1
"We love Spotify. We can find almost anything we want, no matter how obscure. This app also gives you several versions of more popular pieces. I like the tunes the algorithm chooses for us. Playlists are easy to create & edit. Totally worth the money.",1
"Can't update payment method through the app, so I'm just going to let the service expire. They have an ""add payment method"" button, which leads to nothing. It says my plan is Premium Duo and then it says it's just Premium, which it actually is. Then it errors out when trying to add a new payment method. Just going to let the service expire. Too annoying.",0
"Best App as it , Provides a wide range of Songs , BGMs and Also supported Background Music , But it will Be better if we can Clip from these songs And listen those clips",1
"Unusable. Press the ""..."" on any part of the app and the whole thing crashes instantly. Blames it on Umidigi despite other brands of phones having this issue. Has been a known issue for over two years now but nothing can be done. Would rather host racist, misinformation spewing hosts than listen to their paid members. No wonder their stock has dropped near 22% the past month. Spotify used to the best, but now it and their support is complete garbage. Useless.",0
It keep crashing and it keep turning off and saying it's hacking my stuff poor quality,0
Best streaming online app for music and your favourite artiste.,1
Great,1
The best,1
"New to Spotify, kids have used it for years, really like how customizable it is.",1
"Has almost any song you want to listen to, and most of my favorite podcasts. Has most features you would expect, and seems to perform well on most devices. Thank you for standing up for Joe Rogan.",1
Amazing video podcasts are so cool amazing feature,1
Actually this app is so amazing i love it it gives me what i want. You guys should keep it up i love this app very nice ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,1
Just love spotify â¤ I don't go on any other app. You're amazing spotify â¤,1
"Horrible,,i just downloaded the 3 months free and it's just adds,you can't literally hear a song cause there are two or three adds in between",0
"Everytime I play OPM, Burnout and When I Met You always play next. I kind of like those songs, but these are almost always the next song played that it has gotten to the point where it's annoying.",0
The apps greatâ˜ºï¸ but i don't really like the update cause usually it doesn't have any ads and when you go in to the artist album you can't click at the song you want any more . And every time i listen to the song the ads always pop up Please fix this ðŸ¤Œ,0
This app is poorly made. So many odd bugs like not having a pop up screen showing which song is playing and being able to pasue or skip...I just swapped from Apple Music but I'm probably going back. Disappointing.,0
Please put an option to allow us to exit out of the playlist when we are not listening to music. Its extremely frustrating that all I can do is pause the music. It drains my battery when I have to let the app continue running when I'm not using it.,0
"You can't even listen to an album without suggested songs unless you have premium, the whole point, gone, if you can't listen to an album, then just why",0
"I love it and it's great, on the road, at home or enjoying with my friends we all love Spotify. So good job and keep at it..!",1
Great choices in music and Playlist I really enjoy it,1
Best music app used by me so far if your having any issue with ads just get the premium it's awesome,1
Not able to play offline music in galaxy watch 4. When click the music always go to bluetooth find device.,0
"They changed how to play songs from a playlist/album. I do not need another play button for the current song. Before I was able to push play and it would start the album from the first song, now it just continues the song I was listening to the last time I was on the app. If I wanted to play that song, I would have clicked the play button on that song, not the album. Seems like an unnecessary change that makes it harder to restart/listen to a playlist.",0
"I was considering buying the app, however lyrics feature not working.. Well disappointing as it works very well with Amazon Music..",1
"Great app., good Music.",1
Seriously disappointing and frustrating that I pay for a service that can't even run smoothly Every single day I use Spotify and every single day for the last 3 months or so I've been having this problem everyone else is Where it will just all of a sudden stop and then skip to a different song or it will freeze in the task bar and play a completely different song as to what's displayed aswell as not allowing me to skip songs,0
I don't like how it's glitchy. I put my songs on shuffle and only plays 5 looped songs. Another is when selecting a song the it'll play without showing a new window. I've been a member for 8yrs and this is the first time I'm ever posting a review for this app.,0
High bass good quality sound best app,1
"Spotify is awesome and works really great,but there is also a problem for me that it dosnt really let me play it in background,even if I allowed it.It just turns of completely at one moment,but that's not a giant problem.Also that sometimes the part that shows at what moment the song is playing and what song is playing dosnt appear sometimes,but it's also not a massive problem",0
"Great content, app has improved a lot as well. The lyrics addition has taken this to another level.",1
"Is ok. But false advertising with the 30 min of uninterupted listening. Watched the ad, heard 1 song, then stuck with 3 more ads. Might as well listen to radio.",0
Edit : I upgraded to premium awhile back like 3 years ago and have had it since. Spotify is great BUT one issue it crashes please fix this.,0
I can't play some 8d music. It sucks,0
"I enjoy Spotify however I do not like Spotify cuts my songs off for commercials they could play a few more songs before they play sn obseign amount of commercials, I would go somewhere else but it is the best station.",1
Everything about spotify to me is just great. Ive used this platform since i was 12 years old! It has always inspired me and brought music positivity in my life more than other apps :),1
Has been playing up since last update. My now playing isn't showing and it doesn't send the info to my car Bluetooth so I can't see what's playing or change music. I have Uninstalled app and reset and still same issue. Spotify.... you have one job... don't piss off your paying customers... sort it out!!!,0
"I don't know what happened with this last update, but all my music plays like a CD skipping. I can't listen to my music like this ðŸ¤¬",0
Unlike apple music you can even play music free with ads thought but the algorithm for creating there playlists you will find it no where else..!,0
"From last few days, the music player is not accessible. The music is playing on the backgroud but you can't forward, pause it as the music player can't be seen. Secondly the music stops after 2-3 songs.",0
Spotify is life and it's the first thing I ever subscribed to ðŸŽ¯,0
Love the app it works perfectly I am so thankful to have this app,1
Great idea but buggy and missing basic features It has been pausing randomly every 5-10 minutes. I keep having to re-download music. There's no option to play all downloaded music. Edit the now playing doesn't show up any more so when the song stops I can't even press play,0
you can find most of the songs easly and its a very good app in genral,1
Very good quality of product ðŸ‘Œ,1
"I really liked this application and I advise everyone to download it, but the only problem is when I want to listen to songs without the Internet, I can not, but the application is still very good ðŸ˜â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸",1
"You have to pay to enjoy most things, ads everywhere, whenever I try to play a song it play's something completely different. I'm only using Spotify because the other app I'd normally use doesn't work with this phone, if I could find anything else that I like I'd use it over Spotify any day but it does the job I guess definitely not the worst",0
"Hate app after last update get your stuff together no current playing on screen, randomly stops playing Reinstalled app as thought it was buggin again nope I have premium subscription and the way the app is at the moment is very frustrating",0
"As a premium user, I can't comment on the ads since I don't get any. The daily mixes have gotten a lot better. Newer features like finding music from lyrics on search bar are actually helpful and intuitive. It would be better if it had different audio options like 8D. Also they do not have ALL songs like yt which could be annoying.",0
"It literally has every song,genre,podcast that you could wish for. One think that would make it phenomenal is if there was a sound search for when a song is playing and you want to know what it is like shazam.",1
"Spotify has been around for a long time and know how to make a good music app. Everything is laid out simple, finding songs and making playlists easy.",1
"The glitches I was experiencing have been resolved, seemingly. I love this app and the service more than all of the other music apps and services.",1
Awesome,1
I'm very happy with this app because it provides all my favorite songs,1
"30 mins of add free music, dont last 30 minutes, it actually lasts around 15 minute, also they went crazy with adds. Now a days they be shoving 6 to 7 in a row. Not just that but you guys actually start cutting off songs when they aren't even half way done . I mean damn I don't have premium but you don't gotta make the app so trashy to the point where you can't even listen to a full song.",0
"I can find anything that peeks my interests. Great content or controversial, we need to hear all view points to decide for our self's the truth.",0
Great songs from this app.,1
Spotify is the best. ðŸ‘,1
"WHAT HAPPEN TO THE CANVAS? I can't skip to next songs (both on phone and Bluetooth), cannot select loop, random, or direct, can't see the lyrics, and can't skip through songs. PLEASE FIX THIS",0
"Completely bugged since last update! I am unable to see or play any of my playlists, shows or anything! I'll ask for a refund of my fee cause I simply cannot use the app in my android phone. So sad to see such a wonderful app being so badly managed and they simply don't correct it!",0
Ideal app,1
Awesome app.Thanks Spotify team for your good efforts.,1
"I can't listen to Joni Mitchell or Neil Young anymore because Spotify refuses to stop platforming anti-vax rhetoric and covid-19 misinformation. Also, the app is impossible to use unless you fork over for a subscription.",0
Just love love this app my speaker is on all the time 5 star,1
It would be amazing if we could display lyrics on other apps. What I mean is overlay over other apps,0
"Plays music and you can't turn it off. Please see to it that you fix the apps overlaying capabilities. If I listen to music in my car, I'd prefer if it would stop when I get out... Not continue playing on my phone without force closing the app. Regards, F Groenewald",1
So easy app for listening songs.Love this. â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,1
I like it,1
I like that they added the lyrics to most of the songs.,1
It is a good song app. It has playlist you can make some playlists of your own. If you are in to new songs they recommend songs every day. And you get skips every hour. But there might not be some songs,1
"Best app ever! I just gave it -1 because sometimes it dosent have the songs I'm looking for when I search it up for example ( Still with you - jungkook))) but yeah, after all it's a wonderfully app! And the adds are not even that bad to! Good app I recommend it!",1
Best music streaming app ever. Nothing more nothing less.,1
Spotify is the best! You can find any music and more!,1
Was fantastic. Recent update got the app acting strange tho. Randomly won't show controls...,0
Showing only shuffle in music list,0
Song ke acchaa app hai,1
It reduces my storage to be fully songs that I can make a playlist n play it online ðŸ’¯,0
Spotify opened up a whole new music world to me,1
This is a new phone had it on my other phone loved it.os there away to get my Playlist off my other phone that at has spootify.,0
Not a big fan of the new update but still great otherwise.,1
It's good when you can put together all the songs that you enjoy and just be able to listen and blast them when you are driving..Don't even have to worry about the next song without having to turn it down and wait for another jam to come out...You just keep it going..Especially the hard to get kinda music..,1
Why on God's green Earth would you remove the preview songs option?! What was the reason?!,0
Many option for individuals type of music n musicians from all around world,1
Best music app so far in my device,1
"Premium user. Recently changed phones to an S22. Has been super glitchy to the point if I don't force srop the app after each use it won't display what is playing in app, on my galaxy watch or in my car. Super irritating to have to go through that multiple times a day.",0
Great app for various forms of song,1
Good music app,1
Spotify fix your mobile version of the app. It freaking sucks. I'm trying to listen to Garfield and friends and it plays something completely different. Like mf tomes the toot toot train. And I need to buy premium to have unlimited skips. Get the hell out a here. Why can't I just skip the songs as many times as I want Along with skipping the song to a certain time. SoundCloud is better I recommend getting that instead,0
Awesome music always!!,1
"Spotify needs a major update. It is behaving randomly like it's been hacked. Songs skip and won't display what song is actually playing. Definitely not premium service. They will have to mass refund every premium member, for the days now of unpleasant listening.",0
"Super easy to use, high quality sound, and so many different scores!",1
Struggles on or off wifi. Doesn't autoplay even though it did the day before. Automatically starts playing through speakers even if I try to turn that setting off. Overall frustrating and clunky service,0
"Used to work perfectly, but This new update keeps stopping randomly when I have it playing without Bluetooth. Also sometimes when you open the app the current song playing doesn't show, so I need to close down the app and reopen it to get it to come back up. Already uninstalled it and reinstalled but it's still not working as well. A shame. Giving a 1 star because I'm paying for premium and this is very annoying.",0
"The latest updates have been very buggy. Playback suddenly stops, notification doesn't show sometimes even though music is playing, there are random unnecessary bluetooth permission requests, and eq settings stop when changing songs sometimes. Hard to get into a good work flow these days.",0
"Any song, any time, no ads. I love my Spotify, it's with the price!",0
"Worse than useless as a free app due to the inability to actually play or listen to what you want. As other reviews mention it shuffles your music adding random unrequested tracks and playlists. To be fair the subscription version was good on the free trial but its not worth subscription due to lack of hd service. Also ripping off artists with laughable royalty payments is unethical. I'm off to Amazon Music Unlimited, maybe no more ethical but cheaper and supports higher quality playback.",0
Never have I thought I'd ever be more aggravated at an app that's meant for playing music than I am now I am trying to listen to a singular song in the background since I couldn't do it on YouTube and it is recommending me 30 other songs and not playing the one song I want it to,0
Before you did the update I could go from song to song but now I can't I liked it the way it was,0
Best music app.... Please help me find my account I still pay but I don't know the account and password...please pls help. I need Spotify back ! Url deprive me of music .... Bad bad bad,0
"Love the app but has some bugs currently, playing a song doesn't always display the banner at the bottom showing what song is currently playing. Spend more time testing so you don't release a version with working features now broken. We can wait for whatever update you do, it's fine. (:",0
Andi,1
Spotify app not displaying player in android status bar - I have tried to reinstall it and it does not work. The player does not show up sometimes in the app too. Please fix soon,0
"I really like it! It has all kinds of music, and is easy to use. No too many adds and I can listen on the go.",1
I would have given it 5 but seriously subscription that's not I was hoping for Spotify let me down,0
Awfulllllllll. It's ad box. This application forces u to take premium subscription otherwise u will have face heavy traffic of ads.,0
Im paying premium and my spotify keeps pausing while im listening to a song. Why is that? I've been experiencing this for a week now....,0
"Verygood catering for individual tastes n likes.treats us listeners like we are special, compiling my most played, favourites etc.jst phenomenal .",1
I drive a lot at work. Spotify makes the day go by.,0
"Good, but most recent update on Android if you hide the app and then bring it back up the player bar is gone, can't get it back unless you stop the app fully and restart it. Very, very annoying bug really hope yall are pushing out a fix soon.",0
It won't let me play my music only there stupid suggested songs that I don't ever like FIX THIS,0
"Spotify can pay rogan 100 million dollars, but they can't spend 10k on this shotty app? So many glitches and bugs, and stop it, can't switch what I'm listening too, it says it's still playing a podcast that I listened to 3 podcasts ago",0
"Has been really terrible lately. Spotify won't play when started from the widget or from the play window jn notifications. Loading the app in any form takes up to a minute, and then it still won't immediately play. Doesn't interface with other apps like Google maps correctly and shows the wrong song in the player window. Today songs will even stop completely for no reason and the player bar doesn't even show in Spotify at all. I have to close and restart to control audio at all. Please fix.",0
It was very good app for listening music but these days it has started buffering. Even if I play music on shuffle it stops after playing 3 or 4 songs. I don't know what's going on with it.,0
Absolutely not working at all since last update,0
So much better with no commercials.,0
Love the fact that it's free and so many songs to choose from. Especially the ones you might reminisce about that are no longer played on radio stations. Because in my opinion some of the music out now is just garbage.,0
"This used to be my favourite app, but the more I used it the worse it got, the preview option was removed which is extremely inconvenient and when I listen to songs it stops and goes on again and continues like that till the song is done and doesn't move on to the next song.",0
"I love the app, but it keep stopping songs part way through",1
Spotify worked perfectly fine for me before. I have lots of problems with the new update. 1. If I have songs in a playlist I can't play the full song 2. Won't let me shuffle play to any other songs,1
"This app has turned to absolute garbage since the last update. The status bar disappears, music randomly stops, when connecting to Google devices to play on a speaker the queue will NEVER stay what you set it to, the app crashes & freezes, barely works on Android auto anymore.... How could you break the app so badly?!? FIX ASAP",0
I have the pleasure of re-discovering the music I listened to 3 decades ago. I am loving this experience.,1
"Since Disney started to pay for ads for Disney+, the non-premium version of Spotify became useless because after 1 or 2 songs you get at least 2 ads, one or two from Disney+ and sometimes one more. I will change my review if I won't get so many ads.",0
"Brilliant for on the move,driving and walking. Really worth having. Cheers",1
"Solid. Sometimes I have some app navigation frustrations, but overall I prefer spotify to other streaming options, by far. I also love the podcast selection, especially Joe R.",1
"If you love music, you'll love Spotify",1
I don't like the ad s but everything else is PERFECT,1
So far so good. I've never had a problem or complaint with this app.,1
Yes I am impressed the App,1
"Crashes constantly, doesn't display the podcast you are actually listening to, pause and play button doesn't work most of the time. Trash.",0
Spotty is the best! They have all my favorite music.,1
This app is bekar,1
"USELESS. It used to be good but now you cant even pick your own songs, and you have to shuffle, but you cant shuffle for more than 6 times so, might as well use YouTube instead.",0
This app is the best and perfect. I will rate you 100% cos you make me to hear and good in the music world. Keep it up and let us enjoy to the bream of flows.,1
Great App great music and very easy to use highly recommended,1
Can you pls stop putting stupid songs in my playlist. And you sad 30 min but after 2 songs ads,0
Just go ahead and make this app paid... You can't even use it to listen to music without 'premium',0
I hate it because when I click on my choice song it plays another song it was good tomorrow but now this app isn't working right,0
Great music app. Everything was cool until last update. Now my playlists are being interrupted by recommended songs. When l contacted support they immediately responded and their looking into the problem. Edit: Problem solved.,0
"Nice app, but it said after i watched the ad that I would have 30 minutes free of ads but I then got a ad 5 minutes later so it gets annoying when they promise 30 minutes free of ads but then you get 5 minutes",0
You can no longer preview songs making it virtually impossible to find new songs,0
There are some songs that aren't available on spotify that I feel should be there but overall Spotify is one of the best out there.,1
This app is outstanding in music,1
Add equilizer like MX player. Sound Equilizer is in setting it might be in music dashboard to use it easily.,1
Love the app but why can't Android have drag down gesture for player window like Ios. It's so annoying i have 6.67 inch display and i have to use 2 hands to drop the player window. Other issue I face is that application cold boot is way long like 8-10 seconds long why is it like that?,0
It's a great app the music quality is great even without premium and there are barely any ads. I just don't like that when an ad pops up in a different app it pauses,0
I like this app it makes we feel far happier with the high quality music,1
This is okay but it keeps playing the wrong song that I click for example I click a song I like and it plays we don't talk about bruno in like Italian or something and it also adds loads of random songs to my playlists,0
This app is very bad cant download music,0
I love it but it did make me log in a few times but other than that its amazing,1
"It's okay I really just listen to podcast on Spotify, it could be a better app",1
"Love this app absolutely. One thing I would recommend is listing ""Hide this song"" lower in the drop down of the details. I have hit it accidentally a few times and haven't been able to recover the songs.",0
Much loud ads after every song,0
"Good points all around ... mostly. The new lyrics preview (as on desktop) needs more work. Plus, on mobile, it half peeks up from bottom. (Too) easy to erroneously swipe it on or off or advance.",0
"Usually great, but over the last few days whilst listening the app will just stop playing.",0
The greatest music is here on the app!,1
"Fav music app, I've discovered a lot of music I ended up loving",1
"It seems everyone is experiencing the same issue as I am... sometimes the controls for the song playing randomly disappear. And the music will stop randomly too. I have to completely exit and close the app, re-load it, and then it works. Then the problem starts again in 5-10 minutes. Very annoying. I think the update caused the app to glitch.",0
"UPDATE: Loads slower than molasses lately! ðŸ™„ Spotify is my ""GoTo"" music app!!!! I don't pay for the premium, I know! I do, however, feel leary about some of the security of the app and how it seems to have different music for 'suggestions' that are NOT relevant to me in anyway?? Sometimes, it even shows I've listened/watched things I haven't! With that being said, customer support could step up their game a smidge if possible for attending to inquires when emailed! Overall, ðŸ’•it!",0
"I clicked on the $0.99 for three months promotion and was charged full price ($9.99) immediately. I figured this is a simple mistake. And went to troubleshoot through the help page. The help page is like a maze that continues to throw you in circles, or offer the community page for help, which I couldn't access. After about 40 minutes, I gave up, frustrated and feeling like I wasted 40 minutes of my life. I went with Apple music, which is disappointing because I've been using Spotify for a couple months and enjoyed the easy to use app. However Apple Music was free for 3 months and was activated in 5 minutes. I haven't used Apple Music for very long, so unsure of the comparison.",0
"I love Spotify and I swear by it normally but the bugs are so annoying now. The player disappears, the music stops when I lock my phone or open a different app, and the app crashes all the time.",0
Love Spotify! Cariety and ease under my fingertips.,1
The app is amazing...since I have paid Premium. I love the recommendations...like it figures exactly what u want.,1
Amazing app for music ðŸŽ¶ loversâœ¨â¤ï¸,1
"Amazing, until hacked. But thats life I guess",1
I'd give 10 stars but now they are saying to pay for skip songs like seriously?I'd just use YouTube now.,0
Glitches when playing music but I do use and love this app daily. Can't turn music off sometimes other times music won't play at all. Give us an update for the bugs please.,1
Now Playing bar disappears. app is broken and unusable,0
Best best app for listen musicðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
Great. Anything u want to hear! Ads are too loud,0
"The service is 5 stars, absolutely amazing and couldn't live without it. The layout is perfect and the functionality is great.",1
Oooo bhai maro mujhe marro,1
I really like this app and can listen to any kind of music I want or any language and helps me even when writing my notes I listen to music and write as much as I can without getting bored,1
Would be great if lyrics could be displayed for all songs - not necessarily Genius,0
"Until you remove Joe Rogan, we are never ever using Spotify again. Bad and irrelevant song choices fior me, disruptive adverts, slow to use, and of course osod a huge amount to Joe Rogan - a racist, untruthful and hurtful person they nake money off his distasteful and abusive podcast. Strongly suggest you don't use this service. Anyway, musicians are pulling out because of this, so their selection is becoming smaller. Goodbye Spotify.",0
"I like it a lot but sometimes the pages won't load, very frustrating when ur busy. Other than that I love Spotify. I tell ppl to grow up n get Spotify, Pandora is a young kids music box.",0
Tf spotify why i cant listen to my fav music why do i have to buy premium so i can the shuffle? Like bruh i love spotify before but now i hate it so much u guys really want money huh this is why alot of people are quitting spotify and download other free music on free no premium im so disappointed 1 star for this,0
"Most terrible update ever. The last update just killed the app and it became a total mess from a used perspective. Playback stops, current song player bar dissapears etc... Awful update.",0
"What is going on, Spotify? Nothing will play no matter what I do. Fix it.",0
When I go on to my play list it will play a completely different song so can you change that thanks,1
"You can't play the song you want at the moment you want and that's what this app must me for!! (Even for nonpremium users) it will always lead you to a playlist and start playing anything no matter what you do and you can't listen to that specific song right away and that SUCKS! Not to mention you can only skip 6 times, which would be understandable if we could choose any song we want in the first place but we can't do that and we can only skip 6 times so you can't listen to the song immediately",0
Idk whats up wuth my app but it tweaks so hard and doesn't lrt me pick songs or scroll sometimes.,0
You have a great app but censoring Joe Rogan is a mistake and very disappointing. History is history the past has occurred. There were valuable insights on those hours long podcasts that extended beyond a few seconds of insensitive jokes. No one is forced to watch those episodes.,0
Are the persons who decided to remove the possibilty to drag the side bar down the playlist even using the app ? It became a nightmare to search for songs in my playlists. Updates are supposed to make it better for the users not worst.,0
"It's just what I always wanted, but I am just not yet sure how I access podcasts and maybe also if they could store our downloaded music on a cloud kind if storage as it really takes up much phone space depending on the storage and songs one has downloaded! Otherwise keep it up Spotify team!",0
It has a nice variety of music and podcasts but it very often stops working so I have to Uninstall then reinstall the app to get it to work again.,0
"For all the money and resources Spotify has from barely paying the artists on their platform, you would think they might put some of that money into having a really good app that functions well and doesn't crash or bug our constantly. But you'd be wrong for thinking that.",1
At first it wouldn't play through my phone. But I have been able to use it lately. So I hope whatever problem there was is gone for good.,0
I loved the was grooving and vibing but one Spotify was all ruined I couldn't play song of my choice to play the playlist I must listen to song it plays and also it would play random songs that I didn't add to my playlist turns out it was the new update please bring the old Spotify back or tell me how I could fix that's why giving it a one star otherwise 10 out of 5,0
"Has been going good, thank you Corban, missed Spotify for a wee-while but so good to have Google's cloud storage reinstall this app.",1
"I use premium, which id say is worth the money. The app is free to listen t9 all that music, if you dont want ads it isnt too expensive.",0
Every once and a while when I start listening to music I can't see what is playing or pause it even if I change the song. I have to close and reopen it sometimes multiple times just to get that ability back,0
UI is terrible + app doesn't even work half the time.,0
Hopefully later there will be an option where you can change the order of when the songs play,0
Sabse best aap for music..no add only music ðŸŽµ very happy for this aap,1
"there's no ability to play your playlist in order, only shuffle. worse experience than desktop web app",0
Update needed The app doesn't appear in my notification bar & in order to turn off the music I have to restart my entire phone because it has completely disappeared otherwise.,0
"Loved this app, but after the ""6 skips per hour"" update, i haven't been able to skip at all. Not even once Edit: what. Just what. It's now only playing""recommended songs"" aka songs i do not like or want to listen to, even if I play my liked songs playlist Also what's up with not being able to re start the song from the start??",0
love it,1
Spotify is the best app,1
"When trying to listen to downloaded music offline the app endlessly buffers when you select your library, very frustrating.",0
Been dissappointed for a long time. Queue system is garbage. I pay to use a dysfunctional app... at least put some effort into it you already do nothing :/,0
Prefer Classical and all here for me on Spotify,1
I really enjoy the classical music playlists,1
"Constantly acts like there is no music playing even though the song is playing in the background, so you can't pause or connect to other devices as Spotify doesn't think anything is playing... Except it is... Frustrating enough to debate going back to apple music.",0
Everything is price,1
The best music streaming app available.,1
"Man it would be nice if I didn't have to watch five adds just to play a song after opening it, and also it says I'll get 30 minutes and no it doesn't I should get a couple hours if I have to watch like 10 ads just to watch 2 song that are like 5 minutes long like please just fix this I wouldn't buy premium anyways because I just want to listen to my music for at least 4 songs like come on Spotify I have downloaded this before and it had no problem ever since last update it hasn't been the same.",0
Very music oriented,1
West of time this full of scam ... Paid recommend song just i don't like,0
Connection drops out easily. Cant listen to some music although it appears in my library,0
"If you're a paying user, the experience is ok, but artists get only a tiny percentage of your payment. If you're using the ad supported free service then the interface is terrible. I would recommend using other services - especially if you want to support your favorite artists.",0
"The only app i use, premium is great. I have a playlist at 40 hours right now, I never run out of music.",1
"Never come back, traitors. Putin never listened to your service. You deprive ordinary people of the opportunity to listen to peaceful music.",1
The latest update in Android 12 breakes the app and makes the usages frustrating. I did clean re-install and other suggested workarounds without any results Spotify! Please fix this ðŸ™,0
It's pretty good service if you know what you're doing,1
"Alr. Another problem ey? I dont have the constant money to pay for premium. But i will tell you now, the ads are just too much. So much that its too long and the ads might as well be a whole playlist. I hope it ends up being done, but it just keeps going and going to the point of annoyance, spoiling the song, vibes, moods. Just ruins everything. Its like twenty ads in a row. Like suriously? Seems like a joke, but feels like a whole hour passing by, by the time these repetitive ads are playing.",0
Changed my review because the app didn't work for me. I accidentally logged out from my acc but when I tried to login again the app just blank(black). Nothing. I've restarted my phone and reinstall the app but still the same thing happened.,0
"I am having many problems with your app and I hope you fix it soon, please, since in a while if it continues I will cancel my subscription it stops taking time to connect or it doesn't let me move the quiet commands from the screen and that annoys",0
Next update will be probably like if you want to listen hit songs then purchase membership,1
I'm jealous ðŸ˜« of the producers they did too well great ðŸ‘ job keep it up,1
It sucks I can't play any songs I downloaded it plays a different every time and you can't even rewind really I've never seen an app so poorly created ðŸ˜‘,0
"I like having music in the background, but it keeps going, hey try this song that sounds like garbage, and then won't let you skip it unless you have premium",0
"I music so I like Spotify but the app just adds random suggested songs to my playlists and it's so annoying cancelling them. I turned off autoplay but it still keeps at it and it's so frustrating. I would have given this 5stars had I not have encountered this issue, please fix this issue Spotify team",0
They always provide all the songs that I thought were down in the slumps,1
It was such an amazing app. I was paying for Spotify family mix until they sent us yesterday that it will be deleted sadly after this I won't be paying for Spotify because it's not worth it.,0
Love the app but it's crazy that I have to listen to 4 ads before listening to the actual music,0
Wish this auto shuffle go away! If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars.,0
This is actually cool but the repeat button is gone,0
So much fun and easy to use.,1
"Straight forward to use, with plenty of choice",1
"I have a premium family account and all is great but lately the play bar is either not there or not working, and it also continues to play when i turn off my. Ar, which it never did before. And then i cant shut it off because the play bar isnt there. I have a fairly new phone and it's updated so it isn't my phone. please fix!!!!",0
Glad I found you . I am going through a particularly sad and stressful time in my life at the moment. The music lists you have chosen for me make great listening and help enormously,1
I would give it 5 but I'm starting to get fed up. I can listen 2 songs before I have 3-4 adverts that are like 30 secs long and it's getting really annoying. Spotify if you see this please sort it. Btw my family don't have enough money for premium. :/,0
I love spotify its easy has every genre of music for one low price!!!!!,0
Many songs,1
Great selection that isn't choked by ads.,1
to many ads and not enough skips and can even get the right music cause it plays random music,0
"You people are utterly useless. Everytime there is an update for the app, something goes wrong. Now the app keeps saying there is no internet connection despite there being connection and all my songs are missing from the list. What are you people doing over there? And I'm a bloody premium member. Getting sick and tired of this.",0
Started hiding songs that I added to my Playlist and won't let me unhide them,1
Quality sound and selection. But they're adds are louder than the music sometimes.,1
"I hate that it shuffles your music when you SEARCH for a specific song, the playlists that you make? Sure. But if I wanna listen to deviltown, can't I just listen to it? Instead of having to waste my skips on not being able to hear it.",0
It's great...just be nice if you had more skips and could play any particular songs on Playlist as you wanted without having the premium subscription.,1
Garbage just straight trashcan dl it for Rogan and the majority of the time it doesn't load the podcast at all then when it does it'll play whatever episode it wants ðŸ¤® it happens on both my phones z fold 2 and s20+ both 5g..... sooo annoying... update still sucks 1/27/2021... 5/26/21 still garbage... 10/27/21 still trash... 11/1/21 went to commercial 3 times in 10 min and started the episode from the start after every time. Update 1/10/22 still trash it won't load the right episode. Fold 3,0
"None of the music actually plays. The ads do, but never the music.",0
Song quality is not 320kbps..,0
"Man why are the maker of this app is greedy premium premium and premium there are ads after 1,2 song are you serious disgusting app",0
I really don't like the suggested songs feature. When I want to play my liked songs that's all I want to hear. If I was looking for new music I would listen to my discover weekly or another playlist. Also its started crashing after the recent update,0
Great,1
Great that it predicts the kind of music I listen to,1
I am always torn between spotify and apple music i love them both,0
We really are enjoying Spotify.,1
"When I want to listen to a song that I liked, it randomly starts an another song that I don't even know. It's literally so annoying, I want to listen to MY liked songs, not to random songs.",0
It is easy to use but ads popup after song or product,0
"Much like every other popular app, this one sucks. The latest update has taken away my ability to listen to anything without having to manually select the next thing I want to hear. Interesting how making it worse is apparently considered an update",0
The app keeps crashing and I forever have to reinstall it. Very annoying.,0
"Since a few days I can't control my music every other song and I have to restart te app to get back the queue control. Please fix this, I've even reset my entire phone trying to fix this but the problem is with Spotify itself.",0
Gotten much better...I came bk to edit my review from last time but couldn't find it? But think all issues I was having is now fixed from last week ..and that's all I needed so I'm totally great again..ty listen to this literally daily so appreciate it. I pay full price for my service so all bugs were not good . Happy now,1
"It says ""No internet connection available"" and while I see that there is a workaround online, if an app is already broken right off the bat, there's no sense in waiting around to see how much worse it can get.",0
Regularly crashes after 15 minutes of music on my S23  yet all my other music services are fine,1
"I am using this app since very long time, but recently whenever I'm playing a song the app suddenly getting closed. Not able to play. Not sure why is this happening and other music apps are working fine. Am I the only one who's facing like that I hope this gets resolved soon .",0
"Used to be my favorite music apps but after log out, i can't open the apps in my phone",0
Amazing app coz it provides all songs without any difficulty to found them . ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
Great app clear and crisp sound ðŸ‘Œ,1
"Didn't work on wifi, just working with cellular data",0
Something is wrong with Spotify it's not letting me repeat songs and it's not showing the songs hope u can fix it and I will give this 5 stars again,0
I give it one like cz whenever I play a song there is all lot of advertisements and sometimes it played the wrong song pls help me fix this its so frustrating,0
I love this app... Every feature is soo good!! But it would be even better if we had an option to reorder songs in a self-made playlist... Please turn this out...,0
"When I try to create an account, it stays in loading and the account is not created!",0
Yes Spotify is best app forever but yes ad get use more internet there is problem on Spotify but Iam Spotify old user so I can give Spotify 5 star,0
"Hi, Complaint to register. Whenever I play songs with WiFi the lyrics doesn't show up. That's all. Please help me out. Otherwise everything is good. Thanks",1
Absolutely garbage app and terrible service. Please stop supporting Spotify people.,0
Music collection is awesome. Almost everything I search is available. But every now and then you guys f up thr offline mode. It's f'd up again,1
Listening to music might help your song selected.,1
Good app works with free ads :),1
"lately I've been having A LOT of problems with spotify. the songs just won't play normally, it pauses every 10 seconds without explanation. and it's been happening on the desktop version too. please fix it, it's really annoying.",0
"pretty much always good, does everything it says on the tin, but whenever I close the screen for more than a few minutes then go into the app again, the music player permanently closed and I am unable to pause music or see which song is playing. only way to solve this so far is to shut down and reopen the app which is unideal",0
"Last update ruined the app, doesn't work with my airpods, doesn't display what's playing (paying user)",0
I love spotify but they rlly took out the feature that lets u listen to part of a song before adding it to a playlist and for what?? add that back rnðŸ˜­,0
"Good app, access to loads and loads of music, ads are annoying but every ad is like that but there is the option to pay for premium, overall I love this app",1
Love the variety of listening options!,1
Streaming skips on Fold 3. Not even usuable,0
"Payment plan is a big headache. It's supposed to debit my card monthly but doesn't and when I try to update payments it still won't work. I have tried everything the Spotify community suggested but nothing is working. Worse, all songs in my playlists only play preview.",0
"Not the most user friendly deal. You can't listen to a specific track without listening to all this shiz spotify wants to throw in. Idk, I thought I remember being able to but it seems like you can't now. I do greatly appreciate them having Joe Rogan's podcasts though. Without that I'd be giving one star.",1
"I wanted to update my review, because after a small rough patch, Spotify has evolved in to the best music platform under the sun. It runs smoothly 100% of the time making it the most dependable app I've personally used. The addition of song lyrics was the icing on the cake. It has been a pleasure to be a premium user. Stellar work Spotify team, truly amazing.",1
The music is clear and easy to find my favorites,1
Spotify has a variety of songs to play from the artists not just certain songs. I enjoy the mixes that Spotify puts together for me as well. Love it!,1
Great variety of easily accessible music,1
Just amazing the fact that even if youve got smal data the app will work correctly I always like to stream music on this app before you start to rent it they gives anyone free listening for about a month so that after you can start to rent it very fantastic,1
Bakar h,1
Simple and it works well some switchs music of by its self,1
we keep having problems with Blackpink Lisa's spotify and you did not give any action about utm,0
"Recent glitch. Plays without the play bar at the bottom of the screen, nor does it show up on my phone drop down. In addition it will just stop playing soon into a new audio.",0
Love the app there is no prob so far. Also love how you can make your own personal play list,1
"Rock and blues and Motowni don6djâ¹â¹8â¸kip I'm not doing an ego am not a small I want is to hear this music I'm in love with it .all I am is a midwester,ive paying playing band,I'm in my late 60 .I just want to get back into it ,I e made money and thought it would be fun. I don't want any trouble ok.â°so can I get it",1
"Sometimes app bugs, I can't see panel at the bottom of the screen ( where you can start/pause track and name of song and artist is displayed) but overally it's a good app for music, but you need to have premium for it to enjoy fully",1
I love to be give 4 coz Spotify is using simple but when advertising Start I hate the app most,0
It's not a good app I gave it one Star because it works on the first day also like no skips and they add stuff you don't want,0
"Too many bugs, doesn't play downloaded playlists half the time even in offline mode, looses songs on playlists",0
I only ever use this app for listening to podcasts. It won't pause or play when I tap the pause or play button on my Bluetooth headset and if I stop the podcast it will lose where I was listening at,0
Its good,1
I love it because they have all my favorite music and I'm starting to love different kind of musicðŸ˜…,1
"App keeps crashing, there's no play/pause next previous nor song name on the car radio. They still haven't fix this problem straight BS",0
"Has been unstable after the last update? Loses the function to see what is playing, pause the song, forward to next song or go back to previous song. Need to restart the app then it is back to normal? Must be restarted many times a day. Very annoying problems.",0
"This latest update has my app stopping the music for no reason, and the play bar will disappear if i leave it running in the background for a few minutes randomly. Restarting the app fixes it, but the play bar will disappear again after a while.",0
"An amazing app since the day I caved in and got it years ago. Also an open platform for people to share whatever ideas, religions, opinions, beliefs, etc - that they want. A platform that doesn't censor freedom of speech. Hooray!",1
I am in love with music and spotify help me to listen any song any time everywhere I have a great experience with this app ðŸ–¤,1
"Unimpressed with the ads popping up during every episode of things listen to of a night time, no i dont want to listen to new podcasts, i pay for premium i expect no ads.....",0
Very nice,1
I love Spotify easy to use and loads of songs that i can just listen to or sing along with the words. I have learnt that not always was i singing the right words to some of my favorite songs. Thank you Spotify. However less adds would be awesome.,1
Premium here. It works well ... For about 10 seconds per song.,1
Dude you made a update that I can't play the song that I want dude fix it,0
For a better experience just buy premium I really recommend it ,1
Best music app. Ive found and I tryed most of them,1
I used to rate 5 everything is good and fine but lyrics is not showing,0
Easy to use and love all the options for listening pleasure,1
I truly love listening to all of my playlists on this app. I dislike the amount of ads though.,0
"Absolutely badass, way better than apple music",1
"The app has started logging me out when I restart my phone whereas it never used to. That in itself is only a minor annoyance, but when I try to log back in the app tells me to go online to complete. When I tap on ""connect"" I'm met with a black screen and nothing else happens. Can't really see any way around it but to uninstall the app and reinstall it. Again. Fix your app, Spotify. This never used to be a problem.",0
App takes forever to load and then it doesn't...very slow,0
Was just taught how to use this app by a friend and am enjoying it immensely.,1
"The BEST music app out there. I want play anything but SPOTIFY, its the only music app worth downloading! Thankyou SPOTIFY, for all the New&Old Best tunes from KickAss Music that reaches our ears each day bc of SPOTIFY!! ThankYou.",1
This is pathetic app I have ever used. I took the premium account which went well for first 2-3 months. After that suddenly from nowhere I am getting error while searching for new songs. Even after connecting to wifi or mobile data it is continuously showing no internet connection. Due to this I could play only those songs which are visible on my screen. From last 6 months am facing this issue and the worst part about this app is they don't have voice customer support. I want my money back,0
Awful app and service. No longer paying for premium as spotify simply does not work!,0
"The best app on the play store. Honestly this app literally does everything you need and is completely reliable, I have songs and podcasts downloaded that I can play anywhere at any time, what more could you want?",1
"I was going to play my playlist when it started playing a song I didn't have on my playlist, it said it was a recommend song. All it was playing was recommended songs. I tried to skip (I haven't skipped any songs yet) and it wouldn't let me because I don't have premium. I hate that I can't play the songs I like.",1
"Ever since getting premium, I've been on Spotify more often. But now I can't access my liked music and I know I don't have any filters turned on. Reinstalled and nothin changed. Pls fix",0
"Not having all tamil movie albums, wrong lyrics are the major faults I found in this app . Otherwise too it's okayish only.",0
It's a good app ...but it couldn't fulfill my requirements....like i wanted all lyrics should be there ..but there are many songs without lyrics. If the song is Korean than the lyrics are also in that language with their own alphabets ...which irritates me ... atleast the lyrics words should be in eng alphabets..which can be read and learned by us ..,0
It's been awhile i have use this and i love this... But i gave it four star.... For some kind of issue âš ï¸,1
It's very good when you buy the premium but with out it it's harder to navigate and play songs.,0
I love spotify I've used it almost everyday but I wish there wasn't so many ads on the app like it's after every 3 songs it'll give me like 3 ads before it plays a song again and it's really annoying idk about anyone else but that's it for me,0
"Everything about the app is good (for a premium user). But Spotify should allow the premium users to download individual songs without making a playlist and then downloading the whole playlist. Downloading songs individually is a much more convenient feature. So, please make this feature available.",1
"Great app, use it every day",1
i love it i can listen while i do other things in the tab definetly recommended it,1
As of lately it just stops playing music by itself. I have no lost of internet connection but the music just stops for no reason.,0
I have all my fav song in seconds love this app ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©,1
"Seriously, it works wayyyyy better on my TV. Every time I try to play a certain song... Let's say 'Merry Christmas everyone' for example. If I try to play the song it ends up playing something completely different. I play that song and it starts to play random rave music instead of the one I specifically told it to play. It's very annoying but it doesn't do this on TV though. So many ads as well but I don't want Spotify premium.",0
"I've been using Spotify since at least 2014. I even have premium which is the only streaming platform of any kind I personally have ever paid for. It's so worth it to me. My new favorite feature is the auto generated playlists based off you and another person's (of your chosing) music library! I have one for my brother and me who I don't see much anymore, and music is something we love to share with each other. It helps me feel closer to him even when we don't get to talk.",1
Again after update some bugs were fixed and some bugs were added,0
"I got a free trail I didn't sign up for and after It ended I have been get 3-4mins of ads after only two songs. Also I've had loads of glitches for example, multiple times I've had the ad for 30min of ad free music stop part way, Skip the ad and continue like it never happened or had it were play full than not give me 30mins only around 10. Ive had small indie game have a less glitches. Pathetic for a multi billion dollar company.",0
I love Spotify and the range of options they have I think I listen everyday to Spotify to a variety of things!!,1
When your advertisement is playing in Kannada then play the Kannada song ......why r u playing telugu songsðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬.... i just download this app to inform that play kannada in Kannada advertisement,0
I love making my play lists and sharing with friends.,1
"Love it, the music is great and no politics! Buck Owens to the Ramones, Love it!!",1
Sound quality in premium category has decreased. Earlier I was really impressed compare to any other music streaming app.,0
Mobile version navigation is AWFUL,0
Why can't I clear the app once I finished with it anymore? The app stays open till it decides it wants to close now,0
Still no hifi as promised. 'ad free listening' UNLESS it's podcasts. You also get pop garbage forced down your throat. Even though you're paying for an 'ad free' experience. Moved over to Apple music though it certainly has its flaws they have far superior audio quality.,0
I love spotify somuchhhh,1
"Excellent quality. Great selection of music and podcasts. Although, I have premium but still get adds on podcasts which is a bit annoying but otherwise really enjoy!",1
"Actually this app was really great but it's new update disappoints me, I can't play my favorite songs and it's too restricting. This app makes me infuriated! ðŸ˜¤ And I'm gonna uninstall this right now!",0
"Hello why Lisa's Spotify always facing a trouble, this time someone hacked her song the song dropped from tth and you're ignore our protest. Please take action immediately",0
"Ok, so I really like this app. You can listen to pretty much every song you can think of BUT Six ads before I can listen to a song is definitely too much! I can't afford Premium since 10â‚¬ a month isn't cheap and I think it's okay to have one ad every 5th song or so but Six ads bin a row is WAY to much!!! And the PC version also Bugs very often. Then they show a Song u have played 10mins ago but play another one. It's frustrating!",0
"Please add more songs,more old malayalam and tamil songs as well as album songs",1
Nice application,1
"I hope this app fixes itself because I am really not happy with the results. In the free plan, you get SIX skips an hour. Which means you have to sit through songs you hate or dont want to here at the time. You cant pick a song and play it, which is really bad for picking a song you want to watch. And one of the most annoying things is that it will ADD RANDOM SONGS TO YOUR PLAYLISTS. THIS DOES NOT WORK. HOW BSREBONES CAN YOU EVEN KEEP A FREE VERSION. Never spend a penny on this app. Use audity.",0
Very good quility music,1
App that I use every single day. Great way to explore and enjoy the music.,1
Excellent,1
Super,1
"Annoyingly buggy for listening to podcasts. Loses position, ads can trigger a jump to the next episode. Hard to get back to where you were when the app messes up. Can't seek using android auto. If not for Joe Rogan, wouldn't use it at all.",0
Subscription is cheap love that you can download the music and listen to it while you're offline or out in the middle of nowhere,0
I love the fact that you can save music and play it when out of cellular range I like the oldies and have yet not to find a song or artist that Ive searched for The price for duo is great if you love mood altering music Its fun and enjoyable to explore and listen to different and new music broadening my scope The reggae Christian music is something different for me and I love it Spotify opened my eyes or should I say ears to all kinds of music that I probably wouldnt have explored,1
"Ok, I enjoyed Spotify back in the day... Now apparently I'm stuck with shuffle play, it's annoying just let me listen to my playlist in order, not only that the ridiculous amount of ads ruins the vibe, I know it's a company and it needs to make money but damn they be giving me 12 ads every 2 songs, premium isn't even worth the money, overall it has good sound quality and it's very easy to use, but please... Stop giving me an absurd amount of ads...",0
Why am I paying almost 20 bucks a month for essentially a broken product? Fix this Spotify.,0
Trash app. Can't even log in via FB account.,0
Nice,1
I like the app but there's one problem and whenever whenever I try to change it doesn't change it just stops it gets stuck stuck at one music,0
"Today, one of my family members on premium family which was already in use, stopped working. Whe i logged in, that family member was gone from the list of members. Now i cant add any new mebers either. The link does not work. Also, i cannot log a support request, there are only pre-defined problems listed, which does not have my problem listed. I cannot get my problem resolved, so i will cancel my subscription tomorrow.",0
"Its good and all but first of all,When u press a single song its a shuffle of other songs,i want it be be just one, second of all i cant unshuffle the Liked playlist i want to play just 1 song but it keeps recommending the others pls help",1
Great array of good music,1
Amazing music but lots of adverts which get o my nerves ðŸ¤”,0
I've been using Spotify for years. Didn't have very many complaints over that time until recently. The glitches have been ridiculous. To me one of the basic requirements for an app is that it doesn't crash a dozen times a day. This app has not been meeting that requirement. I have started researching other music streaming apps and will definitely switch if things don't get better soon.,0
Best music app you can get! Ties in seamlessly to Google assistant and Shazam. Works great by voice.,1
Love how IBC a n listen on one device then just go right to another device and it's still playing... love it,1
"Really great app, I use this everyday! Love the features and different playlists! The only issue I have is after I'm done with the app and I go back into it, the song that i was playing before disappeares. Please fix this as it may have affected other peopleðŸ˜Š",0
"This is a great music app, but for some reason it doesn't seem to have the option to clear an existing queue! You have to scroll through the list and check every song that needs clearing, which can be a rather tedious task if you want the entire queue cleared! That's why a 4 star rating. Loving it otherwise..",0
"Unless you pay for it, it's terrible. You can't even listen to select song you want to hear without listening to a ton of songs before. YouTube is easier, simpler, and it has a wider variety of music. YouTube is just overall just a better platform than Spotify. Its ads are even shorter and there's less of them. On Spotify I've deadass gotten the same ad 4 times in a row",0
"Good App when compared to other music apps, based on the song collection and genre. However rating it 1 star as the ad drives you nuts. You listen to one song for a 3 minute duration and the rest is ads. Horrible way to push people to buy their premium account",0
"Seems I'm not alone in the issues I'm experiencing, songs stopping, no controls - just seems to be going from bad worse . It's annoying that nothing is being done to rectify these issues, which I now note are common complaints.",0
"Edit: since the latest update, my now playing bar is gone when I play a song, so I can't see the now playing page. Also, the app crashes after a song or two.",0
Excellent player on which I can have my favorite songs all in one place!!!,1
"I only gave 2 stars because, when I add one song to a playlist it adds TONS! If I WANTED so many of them, I'd add them. Plus I can't even play ONE SONG without it turning on a playlist! This NEEDS to be removed. I won't use this EVER again because of these things",0
Best music app suggest this app to save battery life and stream or listen to downloadable music. Not a free music platform. But the music suggestions and logarithm world class!,0
"I adore this app! There are some glitches that I experience here and there, but if I'm to be honest, I think they're because lf my phone, not the app itself. Easy to use, allows for the playing of stored media, and even surprises me with good personalized mixes here and there, helping me discover new people. And the Lyric function! It's so nice to have those now. The only thing I miss is being able to look at the song history of what you have played. If that's still in the app, I can't see it.",1
Such a big surprise that it does not support lyrics! Too bad.,1
"Thank you Spotify, though your platform may be buggy at times, I appreciate you being a beacon of sanity in these cancel culture times.",1
Every since you update spotify it keeps stopping even halfway through a song,0
Better than other music apps I have tried,1
Outstanding music appðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
"A great music app that has all the music I love, and an app run by people who believe in freedom of speech and letting people come to their own conclusions about difficult problems in the world.",1
"I have been using Spotify for over 2 years and after this update, I'm no longer able to play any music. All my playlists are empty and I'll open up Artist playlists and they say empty as well. Says to check my internet and I'm connected, all my other apps are working, just not this one.",0
Very smooth...and recommendations are really making my playlist amazing everyday.,1
Best app to play music on all day long,1
Spotify is one of the best for podcasts & songs,1
Decent app. Had a few issues overtime but updates clear it up,1
Ads just before the song....Just close app and open it again. Now u can listen the song without tha ad. ðŸ˜Ž,0
"Ok. Has a good selection of songs but playlists are always on shuffle and when I click on one sing, it plays another. Used to be awesome. Now, it's decent",1
"Omg this new update where everything is changed, I can't select a individual song off an album or any of my playlists. This update needs to be better or completely vanish",0
Keeps my train on track,1
The apps keep stop playing my podcast where i dont even press pause or stop and i can not rewind or forward my playlist,1
Since the latest update it doesn't work right at all. It cuts the music off when the screen locks and only turns on when the screen is turned on. The currently playing option doesn't show up anymore. The app wasn't the greatest before but now it's basically unusable.,0
Quite good but not sure y some songs cannot listen,1
Spotify is awesome. You could find literally any song on here. There's only one song that I couldn't find. Totally fun.,1
"spotify is amazing!!! but im upset at the fact that i cant listen to a snipet of a song before adding it to my playlist anymore. this feature was super helpful :((. im not sure if its a bug, but if it is please fix it! and if not please add the feature back :(",0
"I gave this many stars a while back but for the last few months it's been crashing left and right. Everytime I start getting into the music BAM, it crashes. So sick of this $#!+ going back to the other one. Back to one star since I can't give it ZERO.",0
Love the very much-loved tunes,1
"Love this app , have had it for many years . Love the lay out , suggestions, how I can put all my artist in separate collections .. the issue I have now is . It only plays for 15 - 20 minutes and then turns off . When I play it through my car stereo, or on my charging dock at home . Seems to happen since 2 updates ago .. would be nice if we can fix that .. second issue since those updates , is I can't control it from my lock screen like I have the last 4 years",0
Great music any music u like to hear,1
Excellent because this app doesnt neend primium compulsory,1
This app is fantastic I love this music app,1
The best part of this app is it identified the mood and set the songs according in the list without even doing efforts.,0
Why the hell Bluetooth headsets of all brands get disconnected while using this app. When will you ever rectify this? Irritating to the core,0
"I've had Spotify continuously since 2011, I have tried other music streaming services over the years such as LastFM, Deezer and YouTube music but none have been as solid as Spotify. Sure some few songs are missing and the features change every 5 minutes but the automatically compiled playlist, endless radio options, enhancing playlists with new songs and other new features all add to the experience and allow you to enjoy your favourite tracks from over the years without getting bored!",1
Its such a beautiful app,1
It's extra buggy after the latest update. Plays the music but doesn't display the controls on Android. I have to keep closing the app and reopening it. What's up?,0
I can't pick the songs I wanted...,0
Thise are a very usefull app and it get u all the songs ure looking for from old-school to new generation stuff,1
I love this app and trust me the premium is definitely worth it,1
"** UPDATE ** I am pleased to post an update. The Android version of the Spotify app continues to have a much lower volume when using the equalizer... however, either a Chromebook update or a Spotify app update corrected the sound quality of the music to such a degree that I no longer need to use the equalizer. GOOD JOB!!!",0
I get to find ALMOST all music I love and can listen to my playlist offline,1
I use Spotify almost all the time for music. There are a few kinks being worked out but it's otherwise great.,1
"The new update has removed the shuffle button gone?Now I know I'm not a ADELE,but please listen.The enhancement feature does not work what so ever without the shuffle button,its pointless.So is it really hard work to give us an opinion. ""TO SHUFFLE OR NOT TOO SHUFFLE.THAT WOULD BE THE QUESTION""",0
Spotify is the greatest app for music ðŸŽµ!,1
I thoroughly enjoy Spotify and the music that I've heard I've been listening for a couple of years I had the premium but I've dropped it because I can't hear anymore and when I have a speaker I can hear but I love Spotify it's been wonderful for my health and wonderful for my,1
"For whatever the reason, my layout is completely messed up. You know when you listen to a song and the pause button is in the middle surrounded by previous and next? Well not for me. And I have no idea why it is like that. I tried logging out and in and it goes back to normal but the moment I exit the app it messes up again.",0
"So far so good, I'm building a playlist, I'll let you know in the",1
"SUPER buggy app, won't play half the time, have had to force quit and reinstall so many times",0
I paid for premium and am getting commercials. WHAT A SCAM!,0
Constantly pauses or stops a song. I need to go into the app to resume play back. Sometimes it will automatically skip the song all together after pushing play. Currently using a gift card for a membership I would never pay for it on my own after this experience.,0
The best free music application,1
Spotify is great!,1
I dont care that people of differing opinions have different opinions. I have used spotify for years i love it and will continue to love it as long as they keep on keeping on. I like your loyalty so you have mine,1
Seems frequently anymore nothing wants to play i get no sound from spotify but all my other apps work just fine that I dont pay a monthly subcription to! I even tried before and after the update nothing!,1
Something's wrong with my spotify. My downloaded music stops playing when I listen to it offline. It only lasts for 10 minutes.,0
"Its good but it's not showing lyrics on my phone, please fix it",0
good app i think it would be cool to change the cover for liked songs !,1
Spotify is the best,1
Love it! Use it for all my music listening and podcasts!,1
"I would give no stars but I need to review Do not get the premium it's awesome that you get better sound quality and unlimited skips but if you want to cancel keep doing it because they will continue to charge you ""because that's how the system works"" is what I was told by customer support I urge you not to use this service",0
I enjoy listening to my music on Spotify. I have stored music from different years of my life. It is good to listen to and makes me feel happy.,1
Amazing,1
Best there is for music streaming,1
Love the premium features,1
Perfect place to find music,1
"It's a good app bht i took a star because the Lyrics issue is still not fixed after so much time. On the same device, my old ID don't show lyrics while new one shows even in same song. Please solve this issue Asap",0
Good,1
Best app ever I usually use this app to listen to good music any music I want I get here let's keep on listening to spotify,1
"Spotify is naturally an amazing music platform. Their library is lovely and you're hard pressed to find something not available, even given the copyright issues with international releases. The UI is fantastic and highly responsive. As a premium user I've nothing but praise to be honest.",1
Turn off the covid warning rubbish. The world has moved on. Clogging up my podcast feeds. Close to unsubscribing.,0
Amazing app. Will surely suggest to try once.,1
"Keeps nagging for a bluetooth permission every single time the app is open, even if I DON'T want to give that permission.",0
I like this book because it has a lot of songs to here and we could hear like a lot cuz don't like a lot of music to hear on there so there's like English or Spanish songs we can hear them on where like heartbroken like I am heartbroken right now because I'm single for life,1
All good except that lyrics never show up,1
It's an amazing app. It really allows to find music easily and create Playlist. The only issue with the app is that gives way too much ads if you're not subscribed to premium. Other than that it's very good.,1
"Can you remove this appalling new car mode feature? It's terribly implemented. Why do I have to repeatedly turn it off, why does it take me back to the menu after turning it off etc? Just add a way to disable it. It's ridiculously annoying and just makes it harder to use while in the car.",0
My Spotify is not working from 3 days,0
"Very nice, just buggyb",1
Very nice. I can always find what I am looking for! I use Spotify often.,1
Why do I have to listen to like 10 ads when I useed to only have to listen to 2,0
"2/5 because of the inability to delete your recently played history now. Edit 1/5 because now you can't even choose what song in your playlist to play, you can't reorder your songs, AND you have limited skips?! I fail to understand your reasoning. The ads haven't bothered me (yet) but should it I would rate this 0 stars if I could, only redeeming factor is the quantity of songs, opposed to the quality of the app.",0
It logged me out for no reason I was listening to music and the app closed and now I can't log back in,0
This app is very good I had payed premium then in offline period I can also listen music,1
In the last version my Now Playing bar regularly disappears. Haven't found a way to get it back or to stop whatever is playing other than by force closing the app. Would be nice to get this fixed...,0
"Good for finding most of the music I listen to, has versatile options, and neat features that help me find new stuff to listen to.",1
"After the most recent update, the widget on my slide down bar stops working after I've had it paused for a couple of minutes. I have to manually go back into the app itself and press play on the song.",0
Stream smoothly than other app I know,1
The only bad part is the ads,0
Not a bad app. But can't figure out why it randomly pauses while playing a song.,0
My ideal music whenever and wherever I am. Lovely and soothing on the nerves thank you,1
"pretty good, adds annoying and cant get premium but overall great",1
Alot of stuff to listen to I love it,1
"Its good but the new system for starting group sessions is pathetic, the old one scanning a QR code worked better and even that kicked everyone out once an hour...",0
I absolutely love Spotify and would be lost without it.,1
"Getting really annoying how this app will turn itself on in the middle of Bluetooth calls or just has stupid random glitches constantly, like the pause and play button will dissappear but the music keeps playing and you can't stop with out force quitting the app",0
"Ive been using spptify premium for years. Everything was perfect, until last update. After update i cant controll music from my car radio(kenwood kmm -bt206, it is spotify supported) connected trough bluetooth (doesnt even find my device: Samsung galaxy s7) after i downloaded older version of Spotify App everything works fine. I tried to do clear re-install, restarting everything, pairing bluetooth from begin nothing else were working. Please fix this in next update and i will give u 6 stars! :D",0
App was pretty good. Recent update ruined it. Can't see what song is playing on my phone. My car no longer shows what is playing. App doesn't stop playing when I exit my car like it used to. Going to have to drop this app if not fixed asap. Not going to pay for it when it's like this.,0
"What is this I open the app but the app not start I try all time i check my mobile network, then I use wifi network then I reboot my phone, but the app not start. If the app not work I uninstall the app and i say all don't download the app.",0
"I'd say a great app but it's expensive just to be able to skip or go back, which in my case, I find it annoying.",0
"If you really want to enjoy this app, get the premium version. You won't be sorry",1
"Please return my payment for this month you just deducted me automaticall without my consent or you did not ask first if your customer want to subscribe for this month,, you just like a scammer,, Return my payment month now, actually i have no time to listen to spotify now because im busy with my work,, return my payment now,,,, or i will make this comment full of this everyday until all your subscriber back out..scammer.. you have no right to receive even a 1 star scammer..",0
It was one of the most awsem experienes of my life. You can tell and i am 66 years old. What is black and blue and goes around ringing door bells? Answer: a beat up avon lady.,0
I can turn my phone off and listen to my fav songs,1
Completely worthless does not connect to Bluetooth in the vehicle,0
"I pay for premium but man every update on Samsung 21 Plus this app crashes, loader / widget doesn't work properly and completely becomes useless. Uninstalled and reinstalled and still same issues. Please work on Galaxy 21+ updates devs...",0
The ads are so intrusive. Not only do we get ads from Spotify but also from the podcasters themselves. I'll be looking for an alternative platform. They hid the pause/play button while playing an ad today.,0
This is a very good app but it will be much better if you give the user an option to translate the lyrics that are provided under the songs.,1
Very good app nice music I like it too much nice,1
Great for listening to music 5 stars,1
"This was a great app until there's two ads after every single song! I'm definitely going to switch to Pandora or Acuradio. The ads are so annoying and they only stop if you pay, this app used to be the best because of how free it is. Where did listen to an ad and get 30 minutes of free listening go????",0
"Keeps stopping on my Google home mini for no reason , looks as though it's still playing on the app. Factory reset, re installed and still only getting maybe a minute or two if music before it stops. Seems I'm paying premium for a third rate service",0
"It won't work anymore everything I click on it says it's empty, and I've deleted it and reinstalled it, and idk whatelse to do.",0
"Idk what's going on right now, but the 'now playing' bar won't show up at all. Can't check the queue, can't turn on shuffle, nothing. Multi million dollar company, let's get it together",0
If you want a basic music app this is a good app but it sucks on mobile when you don't have premium,0
"Spotify has stopped working and is not logging in !!! It works very poorly with alexa devices ! It lags like anything And now it has send me out of my premium account and asking me to log in , inspite of trying several times the logging is failing",0
U can't turn shuffle off of like song playlist,1
Keeps pausing once phone gets locked. Now playing doesn't show anything but music plays in background. Buggy software.,0
Favorite music at ur fingertips...instantly. I love it!!!,1
There's just no substitute for listening to songs someone else already prepared for you.,1
"The app is really good, but I hate how how you have to shuffle to listen to playlist and not just pick a song you want to listen to, and how many ads there are. I get 9-10 ads before I can listen to a song. Or the song just gets skipped cause of â€œInternet connectionsâ€ even though I'm connected to strong internet. Some times I hate how you need to pay for a offline playlist. Spotify is a really good app, but even though it has some pros, it has a lot more down sides to it.",0
Spotify is the best app where u can listen ðŸŽ¶ to music,1
I'm not able to open Spotify,0
I love ethos app because it has all my music and I love how it know what I wanna listen too and its only 1 add the whole time I love that,1
Op,1
"I would have ditched this app if not for playing high quality audio and canvas. But I'm playing my created playlist, not 'Playing suggested song', please get this right. Also please, a way to rearrange songs in playlist. And faster way to add songs to playlists.",0
Love this app. Love the playlists it makes for me. Great range of podcasts! I use this app everyday!,1
Since the mar 29 update my video podcast (Rogan) stalls. Also the entire app will crash out of nowhere. I switched due to Rogan but Pandora is better...,0
Spotify sucks I hate it it used to be good but as soon as they got greety it became terrible I have used it for awhile now and it used to be way better I think they need new management or the current management needs to become better at providing good service to people obviously they added limited skips just so they could make more money off of premium I'm going to change music apps and use something better and you should too,0
I choose 5/5 because you can listen to music and set it your alarm clock and you can turn of ur phone of and you still listen to it and you can pourse it and you can listen to any music you want it will come up PLEACE ENJOY,1
Latest update causes issue where play / pause on the bottom disappears. Music will stop playing randomly and only way to play again is to close and reopen the app,0
"Nice Platform to Relief Mind with Wonderful Songs. But I don't like the Nom Skipable 30 Second ad's. There's no 4.5 Star Option, so i gave 5 Star. Please remove non Skipable ad's. Thank you for giving Opportunity to Comment.",1
Great selection. Songs from years gone by. What's fun experience,1
"(PREMIUM USER) This should be a ""one star"" but I'll be unfair. Spotify is aweosme, however, for the bast 9 days, i've been unable to access my music, I see a ""No internet connection available"" while every other internet app functions perfectly. I reinstalled and try logging and I can't while being presented with ""Not connected"" etc etc. What happens to my monthly sub? When would this be resolved? This is so so so so annoying. I can't function without MUSIC. ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸",0
"I like the app, and I can find music relatively easily. The only issues I have are that if I add too little songs to a playlist, Spotify adds more, and there are so many ads. I can barely go 5 songs without getting 5x the ads. I understand that premium features are to earn money, but limiting skips and features that some people need but can't afford behind a price is not understandable to me.",0
"When I download Spotify it work 2 month very brilliant, except ads, but then after resent update it start showing that you're offline, but my other app is working very good so there is no network issue, and ads are remain playing. Please fix this",1
Excellent,1
"App is bugged Podcast has an ad inserted? Ends it as played after ad. Podcast has ""questionable"" material? Bugs out and shuts down. I've thought many issues would be resolved if paying for premium. But once these companies get your money they care even less about the product.",0
I love this app but I recommended of you can to get premium so then you can skip and not have to listen to adverts,1
STILL Keeps crashing for no reason it's getting worse,0
I hate you so much I can't tap on my favorite song and play it and it keep playing stupid suggested songs and there's no delete button I hate it 1 star,0
Love it got all the songs that you want to hear very good relaxing not too many commercials I recommend this all my friends,1
2022: finally ðŸ™Œ 2020: still nothing? 2018: Can we have swipe to add to queue feature like apple have?,0
"Love it. Affordable too (yes, its worth subscribing).",1
Love this up but on the last update i can't listen to music keeps breaking please fix this otherwise thumps up,0
"It was wonderful until your last update. Now you can't pause or stop a song, you can't even find the song you are on if it's a long playlist. This is no longer my favorite app. Please change it back! ðŸ˜­",0
Why can't I shuffle through my own Playlists now??,0
Awesome application,1
"When they roll out the HI-RES Audio option they will get 5 stars, before than it's just 3.",0
"The controls are extremely confusing, so much so that it feels like the app decides for me what I listen to",0
Excellent experience but the ads are a lot if not considering premium.,1
"App will not pause anymore on android, please fix. I just have it constantly playing, and I've had to Uninstall it twice.",0
Best music app ever and the people who say it is glitchy or crashes that's bc ppl have the worst phones in the world and need to get a better one instead of using a brick as a lame excuse for a phone,0
My app plays random songs. This has been happening for at least 3 weeks now. I am trying to practice my patience but I am having problems. Can anyone help me?,0
For me it's a very good app and it helps me when I'm sad and it makes me feel energetic again,1
There should be just a few more free options,0
Recent update with new UI changes has made the app substantially unstable to the point the app crashes while the phone is locked then tries to play music with no input or display of music player on the Spotify app,0
"My first week using the app was amazing. I even recommended it to my friend. Howerver, I opened the app today and it turned out that that was my free trial. It pissed me off that I couldn't listen to the songs fully in my playlist. On top of that once I selected a song that I like it always plays a random song. Just because I don't have the 'Spotify Premium' all of this is happening. Like come on people who don't have a lot of money have the right to enjoy the songs they like too!",0
The experience is good but if anyone ho search an artist all songs must appear,1
"I've had nothing but glitches. 1. Not being able to play downloaded music when offline. 2. Music randomly stopping. To prevent this I have to clear the cache, force stop the app and restart my phone EVERY TIME I want to use the app. 3. Now the app logged me out and I can't log back in because I'm offline eventhough I'm on WIFI with no connectivity issues. I'm going back to Spotify Lite.",0
Excellent app. All types of songs basically available here,1
"Exceptional, stupendous,change nothing! You can improve on things if it's necessary as per me, i am satisfied. There's none like close to Spotify.The ability to play and replay music have put Spotify in a place where no other can attend or reach. In my world, all is Spotify 24/7 all year long. The opportunity to sing along declares Spotify the sole medium of music for me.I have the ability to learn the lyrics of my favorite songs and artists. All hell Bravissimo Spotify in my ðŸ›–.",1
Most recent update is buggy and frustrating.,0
"It improved since I last used it, still sucks that i can't use student premium as a highschool student tho-",1
"It is good to listen to music. It is a bit dodgy when used with a galaxy watch active but it is good. It would be 5 stars however some of the adverts are really obnoxious and annoying. For example the advert for where you shouldn't use your phone while driving, they managed to choose the most annoying voice possible. A small improvement could be for today's top hit and use people who they listen to like I listen to foo fighters so maybe have dave grohl say something or for others like Ed sheeran",0
Amazing any tune u want any time x,1
Amazing,1
"It's got most music, very occasionally there are glitches with it playing but saying it's not playing and stuff, not entirely sure how it's recommendations work either, sometimes I feel like certain artists are kinda pushed onto me a bit too much. Generally though it's great and definitely worth the subscription fee.",0
Super,1
It's awesome having all the songs you can think of in 1 spot and the lyrics playing along is the best feature. Love it,1
I mean it's a great app for listening to music but I have it 4 because of the adverts I think you can use less of them but overall the app is excellent for listening to music,1
"Would like to know how to block specific artists from being played on my account. Otherwise, seems fine so far..",1
"This app would be much better if y'all separate podcast from music, and add a ""shuffle all"" for downloads, like YouTube Music.",0
They have the best commercial,1
Music ðŸŽ¶ is a wonderful thing and it takes us to wonderlandðŸ¦‹ the Spotify gave us wings to goðŸ¦„,1
Nice default playlist and best beat production,1
Good not too much not too much demand for premium free mode works great,0
"Number one source for misinformation, great job guys, uninstalling and cancelling my subscription.",0
Always a good follow through to my playlist!,1
"i have a handful of songs i like to put on loop when i fall asleep, but it keeps adding songs to the freaking playlist. tried adding duplicates, it doesnt help, any less than 15 individual songs and it adds more. im done with dealing with it, uninstalling the app and downloading the songs off of youtube and doing it oldschool. and yes, its for the free verion only, but some of us cant afford premium because of a little something known as being poor.",0
"This is a good app, I like the music, it gives me alot of good brain chemicals",1
Waw this good app I found all song i want to play it,1
"The first two weeks were great! But when that was over, I listen to one of my playlists and it has music I didn't want in it! It's really frustrating to me when the playlists I make have music I don't want in it. How do I fix this, and if I can't, please fix it.",0
The app has been really glitchy lately never had problems with it not changing from my Bluetooth and not turning of when going out of app,1
It's so good that I have it on lop and I listen to it every day wen I'm on my ps4.And my phone so it's 4 stars for me only because I have to listen to it with Wi-Fi but I love it.,1
Awesome app for music but it still won't let me connect to my friends even though I'm a premium and they are too. It needs some work in that regard.,0
Ghost Spotify My spotify keeps playing by itself when it's closed And since 2 weeks ago I no longer have the play and stop option I need to reboot my phone everytime that it starts playing Very annoying Used to love the app until this happened,0
it great for listening to music but there's a small bug where sometime the 1 hour of ad free listening don't work like sometimes you watch it but it doesn't work or it Will not play the ad and ps even on fresh data/WiFi,0
It's good but I can't download songs without premium,1
Its a good experience for listening to music with premium but without theres a lot of ads,1
up until now no response email tagging a lot on twitter Money by LISA nowhere to be found on TTH monthly listeners unknown stolen streams increasing i can't with y'all seriously this is not first time happen before.,0
"Ads are like commercial breaks (I have had 8 ads one time) and several songs I listen to are blocked. And when I turn my phone off and listen, the music will skip like a CD.",0
Ahhhhhhhhhh I think Spotify is the best approach when it comes to listen full full album,1
I think this is a great way to support artists and stream music without needing an iPhone (Apple Music) but dang these ads! I understand being free we need them but I literally just 6 ads all 30 seconds or longer back to back. I don't have money to pay for a subscription and it was just ridiculous needing to listen to so many when I could go on YouTube for the same thing with ads I can skip or that are shorter.,0
When I use Spotify I cannot do anything else using my phone Xiaomi 11T.,0
Nice app,1
It's a really nice app. Has almost all the songs which one could ever dream of. The only problem is too many ads. If maybe u could somehow reduce the amounts of ads for free listeners then that'll be great.ðŸ‘,1
LOVE,1
This is the best music app that I've ever used in my life (and it'll be the best for the rest of it),1
"For music, it is the best app but for podcast google podcast is the best for me. You should learn from them.",1
"Does everything I want and more. Now if I could just find a place I can download music to add to GoPro videos, I'd be set.",0
I love that I am able to find so many of the songs I grew up on!,1
Only plays shuffle. Spotify sux,0
Very good and special app for music,1
"I have had it for about two weeks now and it's good, so far. Listening to a lot of Phil Collins and DMX. Yes, I like both!",1
This is the worst I was trying to play my favorite song and it didn't let me that's why I rate it a one out of 5 I hope you get rid of this update and put it back to the normal. much prefer for when this update was not out,0
"The music choices are great, but look. Spotify took money out of my bank account to pay for premium, which is fine by me it means less time messing around. But they took money, and didn't give me my premium. My app is not working, none of my music is showing up and despite me constantly having WiFi it doesn't recognize my connection.",0
All the music you need!,1
I can find what I'm looking for easily.,1
This app is very nice but sometimes their are so many ads And sometimes I can't play my playlists like if i play a song from my playlists then the second song will not pla from my playlists plz try to repair it,0
Ive been using this app to listen to podcast for the last year. It was great until recently. About two minutes into playing it'll glitch. The now playing wont display whats actually being played. So I cant pause if necessary. Among other issues.,0
Because of your advertisement in this app.,0
I love this app because I can find the sound track of my life.,1
"The Equalizer can't be controlled but in iOS, equilizer can be controlled. Without equilizer the music experience is ruined",0
"Great app to have. You can pick & choose who/what you want to listen to, plus it recommends artists/podcasts too.",1
Every one song 2/3 adds it's irritating,0
So I was just listing to a podcast by Kira Things they make sped up songs Which are really cool so suddenly something happens and theres a glitch I tap on the song I was listening to and then i press on the creator aka Kira Things and is says please check your internet connection and like I have internet I try again nothing happens it's so stupid Spotify and the fact that like when you want to play a song on a playlist the song you want doesn't appear it's a different song like why.,0
Best streaming service and I be telling all da real saints and poodles about it. Told Rabada and slick watts too. They ain't even about no oven mitt but they coming up and around. Best yall and keep a solid eye hat cause you know I won't leave until da next crow fall into the woods. Peace,1
Thats was so good,1
"I like spotify, but the thing that gets me is the adds there are to many and that are really long. Most of the time I feel like I listion to more adds than I do music, but I like that I don't have to get premium to be able to turn off my phone and still listion to music. BUT THE ADDS?????",1
keep crashing after the new update,0
"Doesn't clear unfollowed podcasts or allow organization of home page. Tried clearing cache, data and removed all folders and files. Reinstalled and still have this issue. Makes the app unusable when driving which is my primary use case.",0
"I have recently been having problems with this app, playing from Spotify and then not being able to find my menu and controls. Not sure what has happened",0
The best music platform in the world,1
Very awesome app to use,1
"The ""play suggested songs when your music ends"" feature does not disable properly, and still happens even with the setting turned off. Sometimes it's fine, but usually it's annoying and frustrating.",0
I have been a member for 7 years and its a great service! (Thank you for standing by JRE),1
"From 4 stars to 3; Reason: Now Playing bar is bugged up! Which is annoying, only restarting the app fixes this.",0
Not working on WiFi network.,0
"I've liked Spotify for a while, but now it adds ""suggested songs"", which have been a pain to listen to, since even when you hide them, they'll still play, and you can only skip a few songs per hour.",1
All most everything you would want to listen too!,1
I always find the music that I'm looking for.,1
The app is constantly cutting out,0
"App is very good, just add one thing in the next update and that is please add the feature to make the ""playlist of liked songs"" so that we can share our liked songs playlist to our loved ones, Really looking forward for that. Thank you.",1
"Horrible horrible horrible ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I just wanted to listen to music, why'd you have to make me go thru all thatðŸ˜­",0
I finally downloaded the app and it won't work. It just constantly says that I'm offline. I'll just stick with Amazon and pandora. At least I can listen to music there.,0
The music hits different so I switch from my phone to me Computer it is a really good app because u can type in like for an example a hype playlist and hype songs will pop up but for me and my brother s phone you can't pick the song u want unless it is from ur playlist other than that it is a really good app...ðŸ˜€,1
"All in all, it is a good app but one of my problem is that sometimes when I play a song or in the middle of the song I play, it automatically change into other random song even if I didn't click any",0
Overall the app is really great to say its free I give 5 stars because although you have to buy the premium to skip through as many songs as you like and if you want to listen to songs in any order you get 6 skips per hour anyway without the premium Would definitely recommend,1
APP KEEPS CRASHING. Trash back-end.,0
Great app but this latest update is lousy...,0
it is good so far but for some of the songs the are playing and cant hear anything or it play half of the song too.try fix that do it is annoying,0
They had a bug and they fixed it very quickly after I reported it I love this app I would die for it,1
"I'm having problems nowadays with this app. Idk why but I can't listen to my music even if it is downloaded. It says that I need internet connection but it is already downloaded, any idea????",0
"Liked songs play offline , helps with signal problems",0
"I can't change the order of my playlist, also some of the lyrics are wrong and I can find all the songs that I want",0
Counts skips songs as played songs for 30 minute ad cool down,0
I'll be turning 50 soon and have been listening to music I've loved for decades now. I tried using Pandora to find music that I like that is like what I like but it started playing the same thing over and over. Spotify's AI keeps providing me with a weekly list of music that I often add to my regular rotation,1
It's good and all but I need to be able to play my song in order not just shuffle,0
Constantly crashes. Can't listen to more than 5 minutes without having to reopen and load again.,0
"5+ years customer, the audio quality is really bad recently and I tested with different headphones 2 Bose QC Earbuds and Sony Wf1000xm4, I deleted the app cleared the cashe and the proplem still exist! Fix it please",0
UPDATED: the recent Android version is very buggy. Random pausing and display errors with the player not showing so you can't interact with the song requiring a hard close/open. Seems to be a common new complaint,0
"Songs stop after 2 seconds now on my Pixel 6, after the last update.",0
"I Listen to Spotify daily for hours, and have for years",1
After last update I can't share any songs or copy links,0
BEST,1
"Great Easy to use, clear sound app very easy to use and find what you are looking for",1
"Allow Bluetooth access to control nearby devices? Even if I select yes it pops up everytime I go back to the app, even if I'm still using the app and didn't reopen it. Why do you need Bluetooth access to control nearby devices?",0
Good collection of songs but too much advertisement. Every single time they played advertisement before playing a song.,0
The ads and skipping 6 tracks per hour is a problem for me,0
Playbar is missing in latest version. Frequent crashes.,0
It's super app for listening music but it has more advertisement ðŸ¥± it is very bad ðŸ˜” can you please remove the ads from Spotify,0
Constantly good in delivering some good songs....only problem is I need more songs from different countries in Africa not just from only well known artists but also upcoming,1
If you buy premium then you don't wanna stop listening. Without premium there are too many advertisements. So i give it a 4star,1
Best music streaming out there,1
If every time it didn't attempt to start on top of my iHeartRadio when I drove I would give it five stars. But seeing as it wants to over ride my other app it's not worth the 5 stars. I only use it for music on my ps5 not when I'm driving.,0
Listening to music is a great tool and this is the best app to use I have bought premium membership and its just so great I can listen to everything I want whenever I want,1
This App is perfectly fine dark theme mode i love it suits me wonderfully love everything of this App But recently i don't like what it does it undownloads some of my albums i have enough storage but it still does that than i have to download them all over again for why if i already downloaded them Spotify is upsetting me lately. But what i llike actually not like but love the fact that it gives you a few days to pay your account because sometimes my money isn't in the bank right away AWESOME!!!,0
It doesn't have all the songs,0
"Great app, nice variety of music, they're slowly adding more tools to help customize playlist for a more personalized experience. Lately it's been bugging a bit, where if I'm playing music on the background and I come back to the app the ""now playing"" controls disappear, even tho the music is still playing. The notification player is also greyed out and unresponsive at those moments, so I can't stop the music from playing unless I force stop the app.",0
"It's been like a year and a half since I doawnload spotify at first it was amazing, unlimited skips, no shuffle play, you can skip mins or secs in a song, and rarely ads. But now every 2 songs there's an ad, only 6 skips an hour just to get the same songs all the day, can't skip mins or secs. On playstation its incredible because we still have the ability to skip etc... It's still a great app but we need more of the accessibilies that premium has",0
"Since a couple of days there are a lot of bugs in the app, except that it's the best for listening to music and podcasts. Hopefully they will solve the problems.",1
So many ads but the playlist is amazingðŸ”¥ðŸ’¯,1
The sound quality is best but the interrupting ads aur so annoying..,0
Very good... I want to listen to some more Bangla songs... Add Bangla songs and songs of Bangladeshi artists... Then of course I will give 5 Star... Waiting ... ðŸ™‚,1
Great app and songs. Very user friendly. Thx,1
"So many ads if you don't have premium. More ad listen time to music listen time. UPDATE: After 2 years of paid usage, I like it much more obviously. But $120 a year to listen to music back to back is absurd, why do more people not have a problem with this? I'm sure a lot do, but just tough it through; which is what I'm doing. Seriously though Spotify, this is insane, we're just people wanting to listen to music without the awful ads. Make it $5 a month, of course free would be better, $5 is Ok.",0
F*&$# Y^$^ Niel young and all the lonely people out there who have forced this once great app to now be bloatware on my phone. Without premium account. I would rather listen to myself sing then participate in your cringeworthy business of advertisements. Wellbeing .... therapist vs music. Can only afford one now. People suck.,0
This app is making us fool ...It gave me a notification ...we made something just for you .....and same notification it gave to everyone in the worlðŸ˜‚,0
I love song,1
Always have the music i love to listen to & lots of artists I hadnt listened to that our now faves!,1
Have a great time looking at all the selections,1
I love the music choices they have to offer on Spotify. I recommend this app to any music lover.,1
"For the past week, it keeps force closing and takes forever to load especially for podcasts. And the play/pause sometimes won't show up.",0
Great app I use daily but free version ads ðŸ¥² otherwise is great,1
"The experience is not bad.....but the fact that I can't listen to it without data is very bothering. Also, the podcasts are very boring but manageable.... addition of local files is a big improvement and being able to see the lyrics ðŸ˜˜ Apart from that, I love the app in general ðŸ˜",1
"Buggy. Music randomly stops playing, even on strong WiFi. Now the play/pause button disappears and I have to hard reset the app to make it appear again.",0
You can find all your music favorites....And still doing it Thanks,1
Best music listening experience.,1
"I started out with pandora back in the day. I liked its algorithm quite a bit, but it lacked the one thing Spotify excels at - playlists. I love being able to horde things like a dragon. The only thing I wish spotify was better at was recommendations based on playlists. I always said pandora was great if you didn't know what you wanted, but spotify is great if you do.",1
"Had this app since my youth never had a problem with it and all considered worth the pay too, better than any other service.",0
It was good plus i get to enjoy my favorite music and listen to new playlist. But there was a problem with my account. I can no longer play the songs fully. I hope this will be fixed.,0
"The app itself is great; however, it would seem the ad system is a little flawed.",0
"Love the app, but somehow now it doesn't show me audio controls for podcasts. Meaning I can't pause, skip, go back, or whatever. :/",0
"You're always updating. Stop. Get it to where it works and don't touch it. Every time you guys update the are problems... or maybe, I don't know, DO IT RIGHT. App is stopping again for no reason. And no, I don't want to uninstall and download all my music again.",0
"A welcome and battery-friendly alternative to the censorship behemoth YouTube. Even ads are not snake oil or financial scams, unlike in the woke Google's app. And if I pay i do no sponsor double standards and evil, as is the case with YoiTube.",0
Can't use the song feature. Help me please,0
Been a spotify supporter since the limited Beta testing back in the late 2000s. They keep improving . So glad to be a part of the consumer family.,1
Good app just like the rest of the music apps. Ads are super loud which can be a pain.,0
Horrible app now. Don't know what update messed it up. Spotify will stop midsong. The app opens up without any icons to pause play or rewind and forward. Annoying I have to close out the app and reopen for them to show up.,0
"Not bad but lately it's been cutting out while jamming.... Then I have to restart it, It needs to be fixed..... Tunein will be my next app if problem can't be fixed",0
App keeps lowering the volume and the play button disappears after a few minutes of listening to a podcast since the most recent update.,0
Nice aff,1
It's free and plays all my favorite songs and sermons without skipping . We love it,1
Free version is hot garbage and YouTube premium offers more at a similar price to Spotify premium,0
I just want to say that the Spotify is slowly removing few Mashups and remix songs so pls I would request to bring those songs back.,0
I dont know what happened but now it doesn't connect to the radio in my car half the time like it used to?,0
"A bit of a learning curve but got the music and podcasts i was looking for, even had to find groups like Abney Park",0
The songs are spirit filled songs they are beautiful,1
This app has to many premiums and I want to listen offline for free,1
"Unuseable in current state. Play bar is missing from the app. Over 4 years this has never happened. Thread on your support page told me to update app, no change. Please fix this.",0
Used to work great! Now it won't load the homescreen and freezes all the time!,0
I have listened to chaand baliyan on ads so many times that I don't need to play it on purpose. Thanks spotify otherwise a very good app.,1
Access to all my favorites and more thanks to Spotify!,1
I open the app and listen to so many wonderful ads!!Amazing experience!!,1
"Easy to use, nice that premium and paying in general is optional",1
I enjoy it vey much.I recommend it to anyone.,1
"Very nice ,and the lyrics are accurate",1
Very good advertisement. songs always disturbe the advertisement. ðŸ˜Œ,0
UI is broken after update. App will continue play through phone's speakers after Bluetooth device has been disconnected. Does not display player button nor allows access them while music is playing.,0
Great music and artists.,1
Nothing works in the app since latest update. This needs to be fixed seeing as i just bought a 3 month subscription. Or i want my money back,0
"won't play music due to an issue common through all users in my region. tried to report it using their website, the website didn't work.",0
Music plays in the background without an icon to stop it. Spotify makes itself the dominant music app on my phone so even when I get in my car it will play even if I wasn't using it previously.,1
Fantastic music app,1
I would love to see more selection from the group digital analog band,1
Fixed audio... except now it randomly stops,0
Fix ur App These playback issues are outrageous. Also for the love of everything holy allow me shortcut scroll to the current song playing in a playlist,1
Simpley weast,1
Maybe it's my Google Home Mini's fault it sucks?!? Never plays the requested songs.,0
Please increase the audio quality.,1
"App keeps crashing, can't get through a song without it occurring.",0
"Even after taking family plan upto 6 members, there are no different profiles but only one profile. It's pathetic!",0
"Everything with the music is good, but the damn ads, I can't man so much ads and for the dumbest stuff. Nothing you would want to hear about. And a lot of times they say if you listen to this ad you'll get 30 minutes of music but then 2 more ads come up right after that 1 add.",0
"Used to love it, now, it keeps on not playing the next song, and it's becoming really annoying. I'm changing the rating if it gets fixed.",0
"I am probably going to stop listening to Spotify because of cancel culture and Spotify giving in on Joe Rogan. I personally do not listen to him, but, I am sick and tired of those who disagree, calling for his platform to be removed.",0
"I have had them since they first came out and they have only got better and better. There isn't a song I can't find on here and my music library in my head is limitless, so that's HUGE. THANKS Spotify!!",0
Really like the app; I have the paid for account and really like it. Some people said that it doesn't just stick with your playlist but that it plays other music but if you go to settings you can adjust all of that.,1
"This is my favourite app, but after the update I can't play preview musics so I can't find new songs if I'm gonna like it or not and add it to my playlist, I don't know why would you remove it but please add it back, it was so useful!! Whoever decided it was a good idea to remove it I hope you don't sleep well every night until it's fixed",0
"Fantastic app for listening ur favourite songs. I don't have any complaints yet I can suggest that it should have a feature of listening songs in offline mode, it would be better and easy to listen songs though you not have any network. More or less it's a great app. Thank you.",1
Awesome. Love Spotify. Enjoy it emencely. All my favourite genres.,1
"Hi to the creator i think this isn't right in my device cause...... Lets have an example when i search taylor swift's ""tis the dumb season"" theres a lot of songs when i click it ""tis the dumb season"" were not in there and theres a lot of ads. ads there ads here ads every where i think those ads will end my life and anyways the skips is limited now,how dare you? I download this app so you should be thank full cause alot of people download this app and giving you money",0
     spotify      best app ,1
"They recently restored car view, and it works well.",1
"Very rare to not find a song I'm looking for.....it happens, but not often. Even obscure music is available, I love that the lyrics are offered with most songs.... I'll never not have Spotify",1
Excellent. I had Amazon but cancelled and switched to Spotify.,0
Why did you click on 1 â˜…? This is the best music app to listen in a car!,1
Good music but occasionally very buggy,1
My complaint to this app is this app became soo buggy i click on a song then the app outomaticaly shutdown you should fix this,0
I love this app would recommend it to anyone because you could find any song you would like to listen to and it is so easy to use...,1
I been using Spotify since 2017 and I love it is really easy to use all the song you want are there,1
Best music ever,1
"The phone app continues to crash when loading the feed and when starting a podcast. ""Turning it off and on again,"" is not a solution for a company that has the resources to secure exclusivity contracts of the largest names in the podcast space. Fix the software. The smart TV app is even more disappointing, still no video for podcasts uploaded with video.",0
What is the fun of remainder ads remove remainder ads for the God sake,0
"Excellent, but with ads.",1
"No commercials, and no adds no need for wifi it can use the satellite radio station to pick up or at least that's how it looks",0
"Podcasts have stop working. Can listen to music, but podcasts have just stopped playing.",0
Collection is good. But genre of any song can be added in the information and selection panel. So any user can play their favourite genre. It's just a suggestion.,1
Love it. I use this app every day. If finding radio was easy that would be super.,1
"Iv been useing premium for awhile now its affordable and easy to use I highly recomend it to get all your favorite music playlist, radio, podcast its all there this is the go to music player get it !!!",0
"Don't know what happened with this app. Used to work fine. Now it constantly uses mobile data even if it's turned off in settings. Sometimes play lists (song radios) are being modified every 3 songs (download whole playlisty, play 3 songs, playlist is modified, requiring 60% of songs to be downloaded to play)",0
I really love the computer version of this app but on phone or any mobile device the app is completely garbage I went to go and listen to music but first I had to listen to 2 minutes of adds just great and I cant listen to a song of my choice I search without premium this app is a complete waste of time and storage unless you want to pay for music each month,0
"Even using it free it was great. Now that I've subscribed, it is even better. It also works pretty well with my Galaxy 4 watch.",1
"This app is becoming more of a chore to use. Everytime I start listening, either the app will shut itself down, causing me to restart the entire app. Or for whatever reason, Spotify wont be identified as a music source and would just stop playing. This only started happening recently. Idk what happened in the back end if the app, but it's now just more frustrating and annoying to use.",0
"The first two weeks were great but then the free trial ended and it just got horrible, you can't change the song you want to hear and you can't change Playlists easily, then you can't turn shuffle off all so you buy premium",0
Thank you so much for ur kindness atleast I can choose 4 or 5 songs I wanted,1
Nice,1
Very good to much ads but it's good ig,1
"Seems to have broken since the last update, thought maybe it was my phone being dodgy but nah, have to completely shut down the app just to be able to select music, then the music plays but doesn't show the media player. Very rough update, don't update if possible until fixed",0
Even though I pay the subscription you still get so many commercials and interruptions and it just stops playing any given time. I'm done going back to Pandora maybe that's better or even Apple music,0
"Fantastic choice of music, wide range.",1
"Takes Up Too Much Space on my tablet. : I have a 32gb Samsung TabA (2020) tablet and the app is taking up 6 gigs of space! It would awesome if you would offer to allow the app data to be stored externally like so many other apps allow, seeing that I have almost 250 gigs of free space on my microSD card. Please Remedy this Issue post haste. I'd hate to delete a good app.",0
"No matter how many times I click my playlist, it only plays suggested songs",0
this is my favourite music and podcasts platform offers great experiences suggests related contents to enjoy for free even if we have the premium account it worth subscriptions we can choose the playlist by adding our favourite singersbands,1
It coo Found everything I was looking for,1
I all ways listen to music and it let's me to save Nd make playlists,1
Love the app the only problem I have with this app is they don't have student plans for high schoolers â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,0
The only problem I have is that for the animated backgrounds on songs that have had it previously don't show up anymore.,0
You can search for any music so awesome,1
"Functionality has gone down. Car mode is gone now I need to buy something called a car thing. For some reason the band sleep (stoner metal) got a fall to sleep album put on their page. My Playlists don't play all the way through, either skipping songs or going to previously heard songs",0
,1
Playbar disappears and intermittent connection over Bluetooth. So many bugs !,0
"I wish Spotify brought back the listen button, whenever I try to add songs to playlist I can't listen to a short snippet of that song. Another things is the constant nofication of Bluetooth output. Almost everytime I open the app it ask me to allow Bluetooth when I did so. All of this and the constant ads makes me want to go to another site.",0
"Didn't get some lyrics feature, like share lyrics and translated lyrics",0
"Great app, and great way to discover new music",1
Excellent service all round,1
It is too much nice,1
It would be great if offline downloads were possible :),0
b great choice of MUSIC,1
When i open a Playlist it only gives.me a shuffle button why cant it be like the old one,0
"Love Spotify. The music and the podcasts are great. If you can't find something to listen to on it, I don't know what to tell you.",1
Nice,1
"This app, in its current version, crashes on start constantly, effectively making it unusable. As a paying customer, that is unacceptable.",0
Its reallly good for music <3,1
"Pretty solid, but technical problems have started creeping in.",0
Good,1
Have been able to download all the old songs from my youth upto present Äay with no problems at all. Fantastic site for the best music.,1
It was great until I had to play an entire Playlist to play ONE SONG!,1
Maybe I will rate it 5star after I have maybe enjoyed the spotify,1
"Best app for music, really. Even without having premium it's still great. Highly recommended. The new feature ""recently played"" isn't necessary but the best added feature they could've added. There aren't any errors or whatsoever. Edit: Still love it, but it's been barely playing all of my songs from my playlist lately. I hope they hat that fixed!",1
Very nice setup I really love having a Very good verity of music and podcasts to choose from this is awesome. Love it.,1
Ads. Just ads. Fix that,0
"Its a good app for a student like me But they are incresing ads between 2 songs which is very annoying not 1 ,neither 2 but they increased it to 3 . For me who cannot afford to buy their subscription ,they are mocking me .However I love their features , easy layout and personalized Playlists . Thankyou spotify (please decrease adsðŸ˜…)",0
Im a dj that got my mixes on Spotifyu tell me,1
can't open the app suddenly. I tried uninstalling it but it's the same after reinstalling again.. I'm stuck at the logo.,0
brilliant as always,1
I am paying for premium Spotify. WHY am I still hearing Spotify generated ads during podcasts? What exactly am I paying you for?,0
Buggy of late. The player disappears requiring a reboot to control pause/play. Please advise or fix.,0
I have no idea how this is still considered a useful app. I listen to many hours of podcasts daily and need to force stop minimum 8-10 times a day.,0
"It got my list of songs i like, but even if i turn the option for the songs that cant be played will not play for some reason. Like brother bear 2 it will be me or welcome to this day wont play?",1
Doesn't work on wifi for some odd reason. That's when I need it the most. Probably gonna unsubscribe.,0
"I have premium so I can't complain about the ads but I can't find some songs on there, that is really annoying when I use this to play music with my screen off. Also even with premium my Spotify won't play songs even if download and I can't open my Playlist without wifi. But other then those I have had a nice time.",0
Tmobile and they forced updates ruined the app. Its not really Spotify its because your carrier made me upgrade when I never like to install. But yeah the mobile player in notifications window doesnt come up all the time. Itll stop in a second then resume in a sec or 2. The skips dont work if the mini player doesn't appear in SPOTIFY.,0
Spotify is like a friend at all times but not good when it wakes you up to turn it off at night when asleep. Not all the time that one is connected you know.,0
Really great but ya know people like me who are yet studying can't afford to get premium membership so that sucks a bit. But overall I love it.,1
When I was enter this app it's took more time to loading,0
"Great app in general, but if I am using the app in background on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S8) or while my display is turned off, it starts lagging after some seconds which is kinda anoying. This has been the case for 6 or more month now :(",0
"Stupid app, borderline greedy. Forces use to use premium, or else you almost couldn't even listen to your album. Why the auto shuffle? No one needed that thing",0
Aside from the library set up I love the app. They moved the way you find playlists and it's been annoying ever since,0
"Much music accessible, but some is not. i.e. Graham Nash Songs for Beginners Album !!!",0
"Horrible app, can't play any song I want, instead I have to tap ""shuffle play"" & it gives me an ad everytime. If we could play any song we want in whatever order we want, this app would definitely be great, other than that, horrible app",0
"This app is terrible,the songs I downloaded from premium suddenly dissapeared and the ads are sooooo annoying this app is a waste of money",0
"In current version, I cannot click the scroll through to the specific genre i have saved in my liked songs, only the ones that play most often when I shuffle. Please fix.",0
"For a few days I've had this weird issue where if i open the app in online mode, it won't show me the player at the bottom in the app (like the one where you can pause/skip to the next song) nor the one on my lock screen and in my notification bar, and it doesn't highlight the song it's playing in green in the playlist either. I haven't changed any of my phone settings and when I turn off my WiFi/data or i set the app to offline mode it works fine as usual so it has to be an issue with the app",0
Love Spotify â¤ï¸ ðŸ˜ Best app by a country Mile,1
It pisses me off that i cant select the one song i want and i cant listen to the song i wanted,0
"Recently installed Spotify, for my new Peugeot car, and it attually works very well...So far anyway. Apart from when I downloaded a single song it tends to install the whole album it comes from.. Annoying.!!.",0
The music aspect is great! But recently I keep getting logged off from the app every morning and I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to make it work again.,0
"I had signed up for family plan but whenever my mom is using it and so am I , we struggle because it won't let her have her music at home and mine on my drive. Curious why I pay for family If we can't use it at the same time. I'll probably switch to basic cause I'm pretty sure she got her own plan anyway",0
Mr Zeeshan Noori,1
"After the latest update the app does not work, as in I can't even play music? When im paying for your ""product""...",0
2 adds in a row and premium is really expensive,0
The only problem i have with this app is downloading music to my device. Can someone tell me how to do it? Please and thanks in advance.So I had to take a star away until someone can insist me with downloading my favorite songs to my phone.,0
Great app,1
"I've had Spotify for a few years. It would get a 5 star from me if the app wasn't so obtrusive. When I open up my GPS I don't want Spotify jumping in on top. When I close the app Spotify because I want to listen to audible, YouTube or Rumble. I do not want Spotify running at the same time. Everytime I try to use an app. ""Would you like to use Spotify?"" No if I wanted Spotify. I would have tapped Spotify.",0
"For what it's worth, I love it. But you will never find another app that you get a month free premium for $9.99 unless we're talking about Pandora (looking at you). Spotify is awesome cos they have their own family plan and each playlist is always curated to you",1
It will not import or play my downloaded files (audiobooks) and it seems to have hijacked my phone's other media playback and won't allow me to play the audio books through there. I love the music and podcasts but it it stops me using other aspects of my phone I'm about to unsubscribe,0
"Stop running gay pride ads in my Christian conservative podcasts. It's blatantly an obvious attempt to push the alternative opinion in it, and it's going to make me cancel spotify for taking an immoral abhorrent stance. You are a content provider, do just that, stop picking sides.",0
Why my Spotify doesn't have a loop icon ! I'm so frustrated,0
Excellent app. Non-stop music,1
Too many songs you choose from. Overwhelming,0
Best music app ever created,1
Was fine until my music kept cutting out for Bluetooth popup asking permission after I had already ranted access. Literally every minute. If I wanna listen on my phone then I should be able to uninterrupted. Fix this nonsense,0
"Great variety and range of music, sheer delight",1
I love this app but you cant swipe down to see the lyrics on android and i wish i could so maybe could you fix that? Thank you.,1
The song quality is so amazing. I have been using this app 2 years. It has million songs to listen. Not a words to say about this. ðŸ˜Ž,1
Made for money and is super inconvenient. Very controlling and feels like a violation of my rights.,0
Very good,1
Want a break from the ads? Uprade now to Spotify premium and enjoy ad free music.,0
Spotify is awesome! I haven't found any song yet that I don't have access to. The app is so easy to use and making playlists couldn't be easier or more fun. Highly recommend a monthly subscription to this app! 5 stars!!,1
I love spotify I use it every day,1
All of the sudden it's now 6 skips per hour but prior i had no problem skipping songs or playing what I wanted.,1
Decent but lots of ads,0
Great value for money - can find almost any song i want from the 70s to current!,1
What the hell happened? It feelS like every other update creates a tonne of bugs. Play controls keep disappearing and audio will randomly start playing out of no where. Don't even get me started on the ads during podcasts even when I'm paying for a sub. I understand you payed a metric boatload for Joe Rogan but I don't even like him and don't understand why I have to pay for that contract with a bunch of ads. Really sad to see what's happened...,0
A great range of music and podcasts. I've never seen Spotify down. Worth the price of 2 mugs of coffee each month.,0
What is with the pop-up ads all of a sudden? I pay for premium. It stops my podcasts. Fix it,0
"I love Spotify. Its the best thing ever. But suddenly out of nowhere my volume is all screwed up. Its ONLY spotify. YouTube, facebook, etc works fine, but spotify just sounds horrible and the volume is so low even when i have it turned all the way up :(",0
"Not sure why they always say ""30 minutes uninterrupted music starts now' then put an ad in after 1st song?",0
"it use to be good,lets just say its not anymore.it doesnt let me acess it i tried re installing it but it still doesnt work,AND WHATS WITH ALL THESE ADS? there meant to be every 30 min.but for me its almost 7 in 10 min.",0
"First off, I hate when it adds songs to your Playlist. I honestly think it is annoying. And when I removed those, THEN it recommended songs. And I wanted to listen to 1 song in the Playlist but when I clicked play, it played Take on Me by 80s super hits. So annoying. Just let the Playlist creator add songs, you do not need to, Spotify. But it is a good app, so 2 stars. Edited, terrible app, I really should uninstall, like seriously spotify, I wanna listen to one song, but I cannot bc you add.",0
Not working properly,0
The music or podcast episodes whatever I was listening would suddenly stop and the app would restart by itself. Which is quite annoying.,0
"The player bar started disappearing when I open the app. I can start a song by tapping on the title, but I can't pause it, the entire control bar is missing. So is the widget thingy in the upper notification area. Please fix this, it's very annoying.",0
When I was creating my account at the end when I setted password and email I tapped on create account they said it was an error then told me to change my password after I changed my password they said that the password and email is not suitable combined together at that point I got annoyed and deleted the app and even though I created an account the first time it all got deleted and I had to make a second account but it didn't worked hope that it will not happen again when I download it again,0
Sometimes a bit buggy but spotify connect is the thing that makes it most worth it,1
Please fix the app! The track that is playing won't show at the bottom of the screen like usual. If it's playing music I can't skip the song because of this. Most of the time now I open it and nothing will even load.,0
"I've been listening to Spotify for a few years now. The look has changed, l like lt. I can find the songs that I like. And change them when I like.",1
"Spotify has improved over the years, bit I feel it could still be better, having more song choices in great quality from old albums would be excellent!",1
"three stars because the app is uncomfortable to use without premium, i can't even pick a song i want to listen and can only skip 6 songs",0
"Switched from Amazon Music to Spotify, so far I only see improvements, no unnecessary extra subscriptions to listen to my favourite songs. I'll definitely be sticking with Spotify for the foreseeable future. ðŸ˜",1
My go-to streaming app. It's Spotify: what else is there to say?,0
The app is getting buggier and buggier. Sometimes i click on a song and cant see the song playing also app got slower a lot recently.,0
"I downloaded this app so I could hear Robert Pattinson's favorite songs, was not disappointed at all.. I love knowing what kind of music my favorite celebrities are into. You know more about a person by listening to their playlists.",1
I don't like it because if I add a song to my likes it adds a whole different row of liked songs I didn't like,0
"The app isn't really bad but I have recently ran into a bug that's only on mobile, were my liked playlist wont show I can play music but i cant add or play songs that I liked",0
At first I signed up for the music. Then I found the podcasts. Great variaty. Something for eveyone.,1
Premium is worth it. Simple and easy to use,1
Always loved the app until 1 month ago now I can't stand it. It always stuffs up and says I have no internet when I do and doesn't even let me play my downloaded songs. Spotify you are about to loose a long term customer if you don't sort out the very annoying bugs,0
"Spotify is good ,spotify make me calm, And spotify make my mood good, My stress are gone bcs of spotify The music is calming,and i can sleep Better my sis really like spotify too, She love the k-pop song.Thank you spotify for making my day the best.",1
For the past month I've had to either clear the clutter or clear what's been saved or delete and install again more than I can count I love the music on Spotify but every time I'm listening to something and it skips it and the settings aren't off I mean every now and then it just works fine but then after a while it starts skipping again or it starts changing when I'm not ready to change the music I don't know if this is a system error I downloaded every possible update ???????? Thank you,0
Nice,1
I'm getting super annoyed with this app. I try to full screen video podcast and it keeps closing and closing and closing. Sometimes when it goes to the ads it goes to the next podcast episode instead. I have a Galaxy 22 ultra can you guys please do some r&d and figure this out so I can change this terrible review to a positive one,0
"This app is the best. I honesty don't know why some people here say it crushes and all, but I have never had any sort of stopping music or crushing. This would totally be a 5 star review considering how much I love spotify but I still want them to allow us to remove songs from a Playlist by maybe swiping right, just like how to add to queue, you swipe left on a song and boom. So untill them, 4 stars it is!",0
Enjoy listening to Great music Very Much,1
Love how they have something for everyone in the family. My 7 yr old son ADORES his Playlist and adds to it frequently and listens to it often,1
Any song I have looked up they have and any artist so I recommend this app to anybody it's great when I go to the gym,1
Everything's great and a premium Spotify user for a long time but recent updates got this thing where offline playing is not working. After 2-3 days of putting it on offline mode all downloaded songs are unplayable. This sucks since my nature of work is going to different places/countries for days maybe weeks and without internet. Spotify is my #1 go to app when I'm relaxing. Please fix this,0
"Spotify keeps cutting out when i pass a free Wi-Fi area, even though i am only playing my downloaded songs. It won't restart unless i open up the app again. I've tried re-installing the app but it still does it.",0
"Great App, I would subscribe if it was cheaper especially when people are having to cut back on things",1
Overall a very nice app better than resso. It has all songs available which i want to listen. There are not ads it is just minimum. Very nice app. Only the place where you have to improve is auto recommendation and music according to taste of user. You have to improve on that. At last please add one more feature 'listen together' So that two people listen same song at same time but at different places . Plz add this feature,1
"Probably my most used app, I use it every day and have never not used it. Full ratings deserved",0
A place where you can listen to all kinds of music. Keep it up very satisfying.,1
"Play panel is gone most of the time, only becomes visible after restart. Too many bugs recently.",0
Up and coming! It wants its places within music streaming! Fast servicewith any issues and a better sound,0
"I would love to switch over from YouTube Music, but Spotify hasn't provided an easy way for me to convert my playlists over and it's too much to do manually.",0
My absolute favorite music app I only use Spotify to enjoy my favorite music,1
"Not fit for purpose. I'm guessing if you pay its fine. Can't select what so ga you want to listen to its always on shuffle. A LOT of the time you select an album and it plays songs from an unrelated playlist. The same advert every few songs (at least mix it up), choose from your favourites list and it only plays a sample.",0
Freezes constantly. Offline mode is poorly implemented. Should default to this mode when connectivity is lost to let me play what I have downloaded.,0
"Everything great but I just cannot find the canvas feature. Most updated version is installed, cleared cache and data and relogged in again but nothing works. Really don't know how to bring it.",0
nice,1
The only thing worse is the desktop app,0
Very good quality!,1
None of my spotify playlist have music in them I have Uninstalled twice and still no joy pretty upset as I've been premium payer for quite a long time,0
"sorry spotify, i'm moving back to google play music. your app keeps skipping & pausing my songs! EDIT: Well, some things have been fixed, in recent years, but this issue has just reappeared....",0
Alot of songs are now being removed and now very boring app,0
I've been using spotify premium for years and liked it but recently it simply wouldn't start very often and I have to reinstall it several times a week,0
This was such a good app I have no idea what happened after 24th update.. Now the app shuts down within a second when ever i play any song. Update.. 31.05.2022 fixed the issue,0
The free version is almost obsolete now.the adverts come in almost every change of song instead of half hour like they are constantly promoting and not only that the playlist option which was so useful for free users just doesn't work wether that is maintenance problems or just not caring about the free version.my question is why would someone who has such a horrible experience on free version subscribe fully?,0
"They deleted my review.... with the recent update Spotify is terrible, songs pause randomly or stop all together Doesn't show what's playing. Not worth paying for until they fix these issues (I have had premium for 3+ years) Otherwise great but this update need correcting",0
Good ,1
"The best music app ever,they play latest songs.",1
"My Spotify is not working properly always showing no internet connection, when my phone is connected to a stable net.",0
Very useful all music I wanted choose no problem,1
"I'm still fine with the app for the most parts, I especially love the large selection of podcasts! HOWEVER why on earth does it stop playing whenever I open Instagram and there is a MUTED video on my timline!! watching muted reels and stories is fine, but beware if there's some random video in your feed lol",0
Spotify turn off shuffle play I don't like it I want to listen to my Playlist in order not randomly its annoying,0
"It would be amazing without the adds without having to buy premium, although that's just me being cheap.",1
I like songs that I've listened to and songs I haven't listened to yet,1
"This is the WORST app ever,if you don't have Spotify premium than you can't enjoy anything.the worst part is that whenever you want to play a playlist you can NEVER play it,there are many other songs that I'm not even interested in.Its TOO much overrated,the quality of the songs sucks, overall Spotify is the WORST app I've downloaded",0
"Brilliant but it costs more than it should. Two bucks a month at the most is what it should be , making it a genuine tool worth keeping for life's journey ðŸ˜",1
They play the same songs over & over again. I personally am not happy with them.,0
"Good app, wish it had an EQ. Only had to reinstall twice to fix an issue in the 5 years or so I've been using it",0
I want play the music but it wont and go advetisment and going to play its not it its random,1
"i really love spotify, but i donâ€™t know why i donâ€™t have the lyrics:(",0
So far is working as good as perfect,1
"The app is good, the only problem I have is all the adds, and there are a few songs that I can't find on here, it's almost like they never existed, but so far I love all the songs I've found!",1
"I love using Spotify, but since latest patch (April 5 2022) I have been having issue viewing the player in the app or on the notification panel. I have to force close the application to stop the music.",0
"The new version is useless for traveling. When accessing a downloaded album while in airplane mode, it keeps loading and eventually complains about no internet connection.",0
Great App,1
Nights with lovely songs is awesome,1
Great App with Great Content.,1
"Go to radio playlists not working, since the last update lots of issues",0
I love Spotify even with the adds.. I rate Spotify 5 stars but the 3 is no contact phone number for us oldies who aren't great with internet and sometimes not letting me log in .which is prob simple but havebto wait and wait for a younger generation to physically come to my house to help me. Its frustrating to always be directed to a website. If I was able to contact by phone I would have gone to Premium by now thanks for the music anyway cheers,0
"Simply select the mood and you will be taken by it, so simple",1
Slowly Conditioning Us Into Paying For Music We Can Otherwise Download For Free ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‚ LOL. But Jokes Aside Good Music Streaming Service.,1
"Needs the option to download new episodes Playlist. Not sure why this option doesn't exist, I'd switch to Spotify as my primary podcast app if this happens.",0
"ads are out of control. Less ads, better app.",0
"Look i can't play a song because you remove a play button, and there is a limit skips you have is useless to think, even liked songs didn't have a play button. I wish you rework this app now",0
Never needed to look anywhere else for a specific song.,1
"Lately audio keeps dropping, playlists stop and unable to stop the audio when I turn off my headphones and app will not stop the audio!I",0
"After a while it won't play the full song when I click on it, and they add random songs to my Playlist that I don't want. Please fix.",0
Thanks for fixing the bug plays much betterment now Bluetooth is stable and the media player is back!,0
Spotify app bad uninstall,0
"I love that I can get it for free and still create Playlists even though I hate ads it is a small price to pay for being able to use it AND it is very easy to use. I hope they NEVER change that. I play it on my Samsung cell phone, laptop, & Alexa Echo.",1
Great music and songs ðŸŽµ ðŸ‘Œ ðŸŽ¶,1
Best overall for music,1
"Really loved this app and only used this for all music, but now the thing just stops when my screen lock or when I go out of the app. Pathetic. I will not pay for this if this is the way it will be.",0
Can you like let me use my free 6 skips an hour. Sometimes like it takes 2 days to get them. But is good music. Also don't show the same ad 3 times in a row every 2 songs.,1
Its a beautiful application make you found all songs you wants ,1
not sure what the issue is but at this point I cant listen to one song without it randomly pausing itself and glitching out. not worth paying money for anymore.,0
This app is good but it should be run offline as well,0
"Recently just started crashing. Can't make it through a song without skipping or closing altogether. App used to be rock solid. Tried updating, clearing cache and turning on data saving features. Hope it gets fixed soon.",0
"Was far better but new update awful! Glad the player returned so can pause and skip again, but now when in car and get a WhatsApp message or a call, there's no way to get it to continue playing the song following the alert as it used to!! Only reason I subscribe is to listen while I'm driving. If this isn't fixed, I may as well cancel my subscription!!",0
It's was a wonderful experience no much intruding ads Quality music that matches your preference,1
Great experience and a roll back the years of the best artists...,1
Switched from Deezer after 7+ years and very disappointed. Deezer app was crashing a lot year ago. Now was pretty stable. However Spotify app stop every 3rd or so song during playing and require to hit play button again. Running Android 12 on Google Pixel 4a.,0
"can't choose song, can't skip song, too many ads",1
Very nice app. Nice sound quality and takes less charge,0
Well I have a bunch of music and it doesn't shuffle through everything just the same but I'm still in love w it because of lyrics,1
A nice app for list music and podcasts i am enjoying to listen music from this app and Premium gives such a nice voice for enjoy best app for music thanks Spotify,1
"I give it a 4 cause it has 2 things I thinks it's missing ,the lyrics feature is the best but but it's not in really neat unlike Apple music and also you can't download specific songs in an album/Ep/Playlist unless you like it ,add it to your Playlist ,but at the end I love the app and I am using it and it's better than Aple music and all other streaming platforms",1
The sharing option not working properly.,0
"Terrible, will only play like 5 songs before stopping shuffle altogether, wont play music sometimes for some reason, and doesnt let you shuffle the same playlist more than 5 times because its apparently a ""premium feature"" now?? I'm desperate so I'm keeping spotify but still",0
"It seems Spotify is Abit clickish, but free is greatness.",1
The reason for 1 star is because you will not allow me to upgrade to the family option and try to force me to pay for each individual account. Only because i am already a customer. Way to treat your loyal listeners. Pathetic really.,0
Pretty good has a good amount of songs no problems really,1
"Good selection of music. However, Spotify lies to you about the ad-supported plan. They say you'll get 30 mins of uninterrupted listening after you listen to this ad. First they'll play like four 30 second ads back to back, you'll listen to 2 songs (without skipping) then stupid Kevin Hart's voice comes back on for yet another ad... Now I refuse to give them any money cuz I won't condone pushy company tactics. They think if they play enough ads you'll give in and pay for an overrated service...",0
"You guys are the best, even if I don't get to put music over an over but it's gonna music, <3",1
Love the App. it has video conflicts with my Chromebox. Please fix that!,0
"Music experience is good , suggests good playlists , but the problem i have been facing for months now is the app doesn't cathc internet connection or what happens i dont know , every app in my phone runs with completely fine internet but the moment i open spotify search for a song it appears ""no connection"" , i dont know how many times ive restarted my phone , put it on airplane mode , but its the same everytime and i am just unavle to search my songs , please look into this problem.",0
You have a wonderful app I pay for the premium subscription the only thing you guys need to do is try to find more Underground Music and there are some tracks that iHeart have that you guys don't update the music library,1
it's good but im begging yall to show what playlists a song are in. like for example after you click 'add to playlist' maybe have a mark next to the playlist name if the song is already in the playlist. it would make organizing so much easier and less time consuming please add it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,0
I loved the thing that its show really relative recommendations and form really connective playlist...but i am not happy that its plays adverstisments frequently after 3-4 songs....i know i have to take membership for that...but there's one more thing...that when we play a song individually it starts palying radio and all the songs are from frequently palyed playlist....,0
This app isfree music videos fancing too much latest songs this app has ads problem this app very easy to use,0
App is good but while using this app on phone we cant change the order of songs in a playlist so i have to use my pc for this work. I too searched net for doing this task but no method worked because the app interfaced changed and methods were old. Rest ad should be less as after 5 songs there is always an ad,0
Love Spotify!!!!!! Always has what I need no matter my mood!!!!!,1
I love Spotify!! Always has the songs you want to hear!,1
"Hi, after the recently updates, the app become unstable, and return message ""something goes wrong"" or ""Spotify is trying play"". The music and podcasts start to play only at wi-fi network, with our phones doesn't play neither 4g nor 3g. I try uninstall the app, but even to login with at these network takes long times. Them I try to listen FM local rÃ¡dios, I didn't remember that FM radios still existing ahahhahaha.",0
Audio clarity is not good,0
"Complete garbage when I click a song it does a different one and apparently it works on computer all right it'll work on bloody YouTube and I can't even manually choose songs from my place list and random songs are playing in my playlist, 6 skips in a few hours might as well go on YouTube image tiktok you had to wait an hour to skip 6 clips U dislike I don't recommend Spotify use another device or YouTube music and they manually add songs to Ur playlist and when U deleate them another comes ðŸ—‘ï¸",0
Oh my god! I am using this app for almost 2 years. This app is amazing a d I took premium of it and now it's sound quality is above than any other app! I think this is the future of music apps. I recommend you guys to plz buy premium at least buy a mini pack and try it. I took premium of 6months after listening some music on this app. Amazing app deserves 5 star definitely.,1
It's plays too many adds but the app is good tho,1
I love having my music whenever and wherever I like and I LOVE JOE ROGAN. Why? Because I believe in free speech.,1
"Amazing range of music and pretty much stays open all the time, whether it be phone, smart watch or TV. Love it.",1
Awesome...has tons of song options and almost always has the songs I'm looking for!! Highly recommend this app to everyone.,1
Please return the shuffle button for daily playlists,0
Constant crashing the past few days. App is barely usable,0
"App was working ok until the latest update, just leave it alone when it works properly.",0
Made watch a 30-second ad then proceeded to tell me to stop skipping when it played recommended songs before the songs on my playlist. would not play the songs I put on my playlist. This app sucks,0
Best songs quality. Many Songs with lyrics.,1
I am unable to view the lyrics after the new update. I tried re-installing the app as well.,0
I love Spotify Its a great and easy app to use My only con is that there are a lot of ads on the phone version and the only way to get rid of them is premium On tablet and computer theres a lot fewer ads for some reason,1
"Clear sound, good staff & easy to find the artist",1
"Love my Spotify! Had some issues, emailed tech support, issues resolved!!",0
This is the worse app when it comes to dealing with users complain and issues ... You can't do anything if you came through an issue... They don't even respond to anyone complains and reports ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,0
On my Samsung S10e Spotify opens when I try to play any form of audio file. Spotify does not have permission to open local audio files and doesn't have permission to access my storage. Please fix your app Spotify,0
"I gave it a five star,its good but theres one problem when i want to listen to one of my music but i press a diffrent one by accident and i want the next one to play but it wont come off i have to wait till the song i pressed play out untill i start back like come on!But spotify is goodðŸ˜Š and also its gives you per 6 hours before you can skip like come not good but i hope you can fix that,thats the one that mostly annoy me please fix itðŸ˜Š BUT ITS A GOOD APP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORKðŸ‘ðŸ»",1
Pixel 6. Android 12. Cannot slide the categories under my liked playlist. Fix before my next billing cycle or I will most likely cancel my Premium service. I'm not paying for crippled software and service.,0
For someone not super experienced at new phones this was pretty easyâ¤ï¸,0
Excellent perfomence with greatest hearing experience... The sound system ðŸ’¯,1
The app is good but when you speakers or TVs or anything like that that I could use some kind of better modification for it for like better control of it,0
It always act up its not good whenever it starts acting up i thought of updating it but it does same thing again and again...no words totally lost it,0
Bestest app for all the songs It requires less internet speed it also works on that It gives the best sound quality I prefer you to plzz download it nd use it then plzz give us a good review,1
Aap is nice but sometimes I face problem like it keep buffring even my network is working in other apps,0
I don't know why but today my spotify has been crashing as soon as I start playing a song. Can someone help me with this? Thank you,0
This App is getting worst by every update. Once it was good change it pls,0
lots of adds if you don't get premium. that is my only problem.,0
It's very easy to get your tune,1
Every month I have to make a new account because I can't listen to more than 10 seconds of the song without it ending ??? Like literally a timer for 10 seconds and then it ends and it seems to happen to all my accounts after a month no matter what device I'm on,0
"Its good but when u want to play a song , they give other songs yo listen to instaed of the song and sometimes when u trying to get to the song the skips are limited .It has the same effect on the playlist u cant enjoy ur song without other songs interfering and eepecially adding songs u dont like to ur playlist",1
Its very grateful app ,1
I was going to give you 5 Stars but In Spotify it would play one song and then starts playing like 3 to 5 Ads that are 30secs each and then it won't play the song that was going to play pls fix that.,0
"Good app but there is problem I face Every time.When I am using with network it does not work.Therefore I have to use von every time.It just annoying to connect vpn every time.so, that was thoughts about these annoying thing.",0
"It plays twice the same song, that was happening in the last update and have not been fixed. Also since last update the sound bar at the bottom disappears and the audio skips very often.",0
Can do it all,1
Was great until recent updates now my enhanced feature has disappeared and I can't get it back after trying everything in Spotify forum to restore it. Paying for a premium feature that I can't even use,0
"Ok first of all I can't even play my playlist in the right order, second why does it matter where I am? That's just stupid. For those who have seen this take this as advice. THIS APP SHOULD BE FIXED. That is all",0
"why tf can't i play my music? when i press the play button, it crashes. Currently redownloading it and see if it works. Confused and dissappointed af. update: still doesnt work and im really dissappointed. Just gonna stick to youtube.",0
a lot of commercials lately,0
Spotify and only spotify for me!,0
Takes a lot of time to load sometimes,0
What if while I was listening to a Daily Mix it didn't change? Also I'm glad there's no shuffle button at the top of albums anymore. A big green play button is nice. ðŸ‘,1
Not working.... have been since a year.. but now it's not playing a single song. Uninstalled it so that i can down again but no change...... have to uninstall this app ðŸ¤Œ don't even want to give any ratings,0
Helps me keep up to date with the latest music and listen to old favourites.,1
I love the app. Awesome. But I know there are some people who like to use light mode so I was wondering if you could add light mode so that people who like to use it can use it on Spotify too!,1
I enjoyed this app but what the hell is this new update? I literally can't play any song. And why would someone want to play shuffle forcefully? Bring the old features back.,0
So beautiful,1
It's very useful app for singersðŸŽ¤ðŸ‘©â€ðŸŽ¤,1
"This app is awesome i listen triple x tentacion,BTS ðŸ’œ etc. Singers song there sound effect is amazing",1
"I HATE IT that Spotify has to add their horrible recommendations to my playlist! This is absolutely stupid and plays songs from artists I don't even care about. I made a playlist to listen to 1 artist only, not a mix of unrelated artists. No wonder people are deleting your stupid app when you do things like this.",0
Best music app I've used so far. The albums especially the recommended ones are fantastic.,1
Can you please add the lyrics to the rest of the music and song that are in the app because now Im listening to Taylor Swift and i want to see the lyrics but theres arent any lyrics so please i hope you will add it to the rest of the music,1
Spammed with adverts only to have basic features stuck behind the premium pay wall,0
I like Spotify better than any of the others.,1
I have had this app for 2 years now and it has only given me problems like it just skips my music it doesn't allow me to replay my music it is just trouble I do not recommend.,0
Stop adding stuff to my playlist i dont like the songs its picks do not add stuff to my playlist fool,0
It is really great until no wifi or data in range,1
"Too many ads that's irritating ðŸ˜¡ I changed the song after finishing, ads playing 2times that takes ads too much",0
So much better than Pandora. Searching is easy. It'got everything.,1
I like this app but....when I use it i can't listen a song ðŸ™‚ please fix this and this is good app this help me remember some of my favorite songs I forgotten ðŸ™‚,1
There's barely any ads and I don't really see any problems with it even without upgrading to premium,0
Nice song,1
Wish you could unload your music for off line enjoyment.,0
"Starting to feel like there are more ads than music now it seems to be getting worse (unskipple ads btw) , otherwise good app",0
I have Spotify Premium and it's really great because I'm able to listen to my playlists and prodcasts online or offline anytime and anywhere. I highly recomend this app â˜º.,1
Would be 5 if the suggested playlists didn't repeat songs so often,0
App is awful. Shuts down by itself. Song navigation menu has disappeared,0
Good app. Very impressed with it,1
Its been great for the last couple years til just recently it stopped playing my liked songs and it's been glitchy the past few months. I was getting my money worth until now.,0
"My discovery weekly playlist is the best musical thing that happened to me in a long time ðŸ™â¤ï¸ ! It's simply so spot on , I've discovered the best music. Thanks a lot guys !",1
Has been my most favorite app for new music specially since there is no more music play store,1
Absolutely ðŸ’¯% the best music station by far .Any music u want anytime u want and if u can't afford any premium then u have absolutely free .not a bad gig !!!!,1
Podcast recommendations i cannot get rid of. The home screen is useless now,0
Love it its like having your music collection on your phone . Just add speaker & off you go enjoy all ðŸ˜Š,1
"I like the app, the amount of music is great. I would like it to randomize songs better though. For what ever reason, it tends to play the same songs in my Playlist over and over while ignoring the rest.",0
I HATE THIS APP I SEARCHED A SONG AND IT BASICALLY GAVE ME A PLAYLIST I WANT THE SONG AND ONLY THE ONE SONG NOT LIKE 50 OTHER SONGS. THE SONG WAS MY COMFORT SONG. I HATE THIS APP,0
Good,1
"My Spotify is not opening... When i open it, it only shows the Spotify icon Please rectify this problem",0
"Any chance that thr devs might test the update before rolling it out? The app is unusable since the update, are Spotify paying their devs / qa the same as they pay artists now or what's going on?",0
bro fix the login first then come to ads,0
Wonderful experience. Easy access to all genres of music that I enjoy. Awesome sound quality. Very easy to use interface.,1
"My experience with spotify is great I like all the virility of artists, and I can search for anyone to download and enjoy.",1
"Absolutely trash,, cant play songs , nor is navigating the app explained. And regardless of whatever you search they're going to play what music they want you to hear not what you want to hear this app does not deserve one star but that's as low as I can go. Install Trebel instead you will be so much more satisfied!!!!",0
Very good music app and premium is amazing,1
"It's Spotify, so you know what you're getting. Bugs and constant layout changes bring it down a bit but the service is still amazing.",1
i hate how many times i have update it. like I JUST WANNA LISTEN TO MUSICCCCCC,0
too many ads,0
"I love how you can customise your own music, thanks spotify.",1
Love how user friendly it is!,1
Incredible music experience with apps,1
"I brought the premium plan still Every time I click Spotify icon, it opens and closes automatically. It never allows me to play music on this app. Worst experience.",0
The app is excellent. I own the premium version and it works perfectly. No flaws from 10 December 2021 until now 27 May 2022.,1
Really unstable to the point of being unusable after the last couple of updates for the whole family across multiple devices. I'm now close to cancelling my family subscription.,0
"App no longer works properly, will cancel and try a different service",0
"Podcasts reset to the beginning constantly, app crashes and freezes constantly, I get ads all the time despite paying for premium. Have to reboot entire phone to get app working again, only for it to freeze and reset my podcast yet again half an hour later. Awful app, needs fixing badly.",0
"I use every day at work, in the car, linked to Alexa, etc. I can download songs and there are podcasts.",0
"You guys are making this app worst day by day. You need to understand what the users demand. Just don't think about your so called business. For example, today I was playing my liked song and it jumped into another playlist. And now I can't even change the song or playlist. What the heck is this?",0
This is Spotify It's like the number one spot to listen to music,1
Love how Spotify automatically connects to my car. No need to go into my phone and open the app.,1
"Used to be really good. Lots of issues and glitches now, it constantly disconnects between my phone and other devices. Wondering if other apps are better for the price ðŸ¤”",0
"Best music streaming.. Best sound quality..just a bit upset with the ads popping up again and again if you don't have premium which gets annoying after sometime.. If they remove the ads, it's going to be the best app",0
It been pretty cool wish that i had more than six skips but it fine like the app.,1
App is awesome but...... You should stop giving horror ad pls....I was vibing to my fav song at night and an horror ad started out of nowhere I was really scared later that night I couldn't sleep,0
I like the fact that I can listen to music anytime and after. it takes your interest and all of the music you listen to,1
"What the hell is up with the latest update??? All the basic and essential stuff has vanished in favour of a ""new fancy layout"" which actually makes it much harder to navigate. If you're currently playing a song in a playlist, you can't start a new song through shuffle for some reason. Which is even more annoying when songs you've just heard show up again not even 5 songs later. Even turning shuffle on and off doesn't reset it.",0
Horribly optimized for android and there is always a large bug every other update that will plague the Android version of app for weeks until random update,0
Bruh it woulda be good if they didn't make it so u have to do a million things to play one song the other it was just normal press the video and play know we have to more than that it makes it difficult u guys are very ignorant use your brains make everything simple what do u want? Cash u make millions per year what more do u want huh make it simple very easy dumbasses,0
"Since I downloaded Spotify on my Android phone, I've been trying to login but it says I'm not online. Spotify, please try and do something. I'm considering creating an account with audiomack or apple music...",0
lovee,1
"Can hear to it all the time ,n no. of songs(of different languages).What say?",1
"I download podcasts because I have spotty connections. So podcasts is in phone, but if it tries to play an ad while I have a bad connection it hangs until I get a connection, then plays the ad. Then it dumps the currently playing podcast, loses its place meaning the podcast flips to viewed and progress bar is gone. Then starts a completely different podcast. Then I'm spending 5-10 minutes figuring out where I was in the original. I love the podcasts this bug sucks.",0
I love bts songs sooo much thank for providing this allðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡,1
Ive tried many different music apps over the past 20 years and Spotify is by far the easiest music app I have ever had the pleasure of being introduced to!,1
Easy to use I love Spotify,1
Randomly stops playing Randomly starts playing Won't display what is playing or the start/pause button Often won't load even what's in my library Plz fix,0
Stop asking me to enable Bluetooth every time I open the app.,0
"Subscribed to Tidal instead, so my money can't be used by Spotify to pay podcasters to spread misinformation.",0
"Love Spotify, period. Great service.",1
"They've increased the ads and seem to be phasing out the ""watch this short video and get 30 minutes of ad free listening"". You have to listen to 4-5 short ads before a Playlist will start and they've put ads in the beginning, middle and end of podcasts. Honestly this app is now more trouble than its worth.",0
Suddenly my song recommendations are really bad. Every time it's playing the same songs. Any song i play autoplay starts with the same song. How to fix this ?,0
Best songs apps only if paid.,0
I love the app ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥° so easy to do find my favorite rappers with their best songs 1ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜,1
"5 stars ðŸ¤© to you, really this app make me full day in happily mood When I play a song and they play related song no need to search ðŸ˜â¤ï¸ðŸ¥°",1
The best affordable music platform,1
"really not enjoying this new update :( please bring old spotify back. i use this app on my tablet (which has a huge screen,) now the app is displayed as smaller than the whole phone(or tablet) i cant imagine using this on my phone, very sad and very upset. old spotify was way better. *adding on* this app still sucks & actually sucks more now. Where the hell is my side scroll !? Stop taking wonderful features around from this app yall suckðŸ‘ŽðŸ½",0
"2.5 â­ (rounded down) On PC, Spotify is fantastic. Able to find songs and enjoy listening to them while doing work or relaxing. Ads on PC are acceptable while considering the Premium option. On Mobile, the experience polarising to say the least. You cannot play the song you wanted, limited skips per hour, and other features that makes me hesitate on the Premium offer. For those who are on PC, Spotify is a good choice. As a mobile app, rather stick to your media library or listening on YouTube.",1
is amazing only has one flaw 6 skips an hour if you dont pay premium,1
Too much ads,0
Hay NakuBakit nmn kc Upgrade to Premium pa Oh Di i-uninstall na lng wala pa akong problema na bayarin May mga RadioFM na puedeng makinig ng mga Music So Sporify Goodluck na lng sayo GOD BLESS ,1
I like to hear some podcasts and music when it's kinda alonely in my room,0
This is an amazing app I use it all the time and it's very affordable. If you are looking for a app to lift your mood Spotify it the one you go for.,1
"Hi, the music is good but there are too many ads for premium it says adds will come after 30 minutes but after every 2 songs ads come and it's irritating so please remove some ads, that is why gave it4 star's",0
"The option to skip, pause, and see what's playing is not even shown. Have to close the app just to get the music to stop.",0
I have been using Spotify for many years now and even pay every month for one of their plans. Never had a complaint until now. I cant access anything. It keeps saying No WiFi Connection but there is and seems like I am not the only one. The worst part is I contacted the company and not helpful at all. Canceling my subscription and have moved back to I heart radio and Pandora.,0
"You could never go wrong with this one. Absolutely amazing, Spotify!â¤ï¸",1
I love the app but there are alot of ads otherwise it's best,1
working terribly after the latest update! can't even play anything without a 30 second delay & then the music plays without showing up on the music control bar,0
Have used Spotify for over 15 years now. Would never stop,1
Very easy to use...has everything I need,1
Having Spotify premium gives me a feeling of iPhone owners. They always feel superior over Android. Spotify is superior over all the other music apps.,1
I've installed this app once again but it's not opening even keeping it on for hrs.....,0
What happened to being able to preview a song when in the add songs menu Ina playlist? I can see the song and artist but can no longer listen to a snippet before adding to my list.,0
It is so frustrating. Why 6 skips per hour? You are so mean!,0
Love this app for my samsung watch it sometimes crashes but overall works like spotify on your phone,1
This app have very good international song collection.,1
"Y'all should really get the hifi up and running as soon as possible, and also be more timely in updating your new releases. Other than that it's an amazing app for me.",1
Great app but sometimes we have to reload it and when this happens I loose my lists... This process is Very annoying,0
"Music keeps cutting out mid-song and the ability to pause/skip/rewind the current song keeps vanishing. So either I can't make it play music, it won't stop playing music. Please fix-- I'll fix my review afterwards.",0
I HATE how Spotify literally plays every other song than the song i want and also why only 6 skips this means i HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE ENTIRE SONG i don't even want to listen to you make it so confusing and annoying i wish it was like a previous version where you pressed play and the song you want comes up ðŸ‘Ž,0
Works poorly with Android 12 on Samsung. Plays in background with no way to stop.,0
This is so good,1
Slider for genre is broken in liked folder. This is annoying because really only use my liked folder.,0
"Had Spotify for years and has worked amazingly up until a year ago, now it's constantly crashing, pausing randomly, takes ages to load up and mixes all my playlists up.",0
Switched to YouTube Music after Spotify was in the news recently over bad press. Best choice I've made in years as I discovered that it is more suited to my needs. Spotify is still a great service but YT music premium is half the price. $5 vs $10 per month. I recommend trying out this app and also testing out other platforms to see what fits for you. Spotifys free service is hard to beat. If you are looking for a premium subscription I recommend checking out YT music.,0
"just an awesome streaming app (oÂ´â–½`o) there's a star off bcs it gets annoying only having 6 skips an hour if you don't have premium ,, the ads are fine given it's only one every 30 mins but the SKIPPING LIMIT IS INFURIATING (â•¥_â•¥) though with premium this app is perfect!!! if you have money to spare i highly recommend this app ^^",1
Too too too much ads.,0
Helpful instructive and entertaining,1
When I click on song to play then app close automatically.,0
I Have my own Spotify play listo but it doesn't play those songs,0
Good buffet of songs.,1
"Can't see 2021 review, and songs keep on stopping randomly. Some podcasts cannot be streamed on my Alexa devices. Unable to keep a private session as default",0
This app has everything I love Music Podcasts Audiobooks I have been able to find songs I couldnt find anywhere else Really pleased with Spotify,1
When we go to someone's profile not the artists ofc give us the ability to contact them through Discord or any apps that are connected with Spotify,0
I love Spotify! Great variety of music for all ages! Thank you Spotify for the many hours of happy listening that you provide me with!,1
Very Smooth Functioning App and a Vast Choice of Music.... Totally Happy with the App.... Thank You.,1
Nice layout and some good suggestions,1
Great app to find and listen to music with basically no ads,1
With no premium no spotify.,0
Love Spotify! I never have any issues! My favorite music platform!,1
"Best music, all genres!",1
"it kept playing wheres your head at, one star, except a lawsuit coming your way",0
Use Spotify every single day. Love this app. They rarely have any songs I can't find and have a huge range of podcasts too. Wish you could comment on artists pages and songs though. Also wish you could leave reviews on podcasts. I use Spotify Premium. Wouldn't use the Free version as it's a lot more limited. The ability to download playlists with premium means I save a lot of mobile data.,0
The recent bug makes spotify very frustrating! I have to constantly restart the app if I want to skip a song. I have to completely close the app to stop the music since I can no longer pause it! Subscription already canceled,0
"This app is great! You can listen to all kind of music but the reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because this app takes to much space. Other than that everything is great about this app, you should totally download this if your a music lover.",1
Expiriene is great But add some new features for Spotify on laptop as the app shut down instantly the screen sleeps,0
"Too many ads, and that isn't 30 minutes, it's like ten minutes.",0
"i find it stupid that im using spotify premium, yet i have to be connected to the internet in order TO PLAY my DOWNLOADED playlist. it should've been played since the essence of having spotify on premium is to listen to music wherever u are even in the most deserted land. this is just plain disappointment",0
Service is great. App is buggy.,0
Why are the control buttons missing? Why do updates make the app suck. My podcasts are getting annoying to hear because I can't control to rewind.,0
"Please fix the latest update! Music stops if screen is turned off. I can't see what's currently playing on the app, and I can't pause/skip/go back as the ribbon is missing. This update has made the app completely unusable.",0
Nice App,1
"Great music, audio, and podcast app which accommodates my choices for music and information from sources which I cannot find anywhere else. I just hope there's a way to disable viewing images inside the app. There are some images which contain objectionable content for me.",0
A ton of content for a reasonable price,1
"I changed from 1 star to 5 for supporting and standing by your content creators. I have also seen improvements in the functionality of the app. Please continue to allow free speech and freedom to express different viewpoints. If you work for Spotify and don't agree know that just because you don't like something doesn't mean you get to force censorship on everyone else. The minute you get what you want we all lose. STFU or quit, that's your right, nothing else.",1
"Keeps stopping mid song, music controls disappear, completely close the app and it continues to play music. Phone has to be rebooted to be able to stop it",0
"App worked great until the latest update. Now I have songs constantly choppy, the player stops for random reasons, song transitions are dirtier than my ex fiance, and the play control vanishes unable to be restored except by a reboot.",0
I love Spotify!ðŸ˜‡ðŸ¤ªðŸ˜œðŸ˜—,1
Switched from Live X a year and half ago and also had Apple Music. Spotify is the best.,1
"More advertisements than Youtube. States ""enjoy 30 minutes of ad free listening"" but I get a 1 minute interruption in about 10 minutes.",0
Not that great. There are way to many ads and it always repeats the same songs from over 100 of them. I only use this app because there aren't that many other good music apps besides YouTube. Otherwise I guess it's ok.,0
The greatest play list ever,1
"Spotify is a good platform for music. I had the pro subscription and, for its worth, is fine for ad free listening. There are other music platforms for the same experience but familiarity breeds contempt ! Good show.",0
"Great personal selection, interesting how it knows",1
1. In areas of poor reception Spotify continually fails to show downloaded songs and requests to connect to internet (what's the point in downloading songs if Spotify doesn't show them). 2. Pay your artists more per stream.,0
Easy to use and a ton of songs,1
Thank God for Spotify is all I need to say.,1
"I stopped subscribing because you had podcaster that ia an anti vaxxer spreading disinformation. If he is gone , I will come back.",0
best app to listin to music on,1
It a great app to listen music at any time.ðŸŽµðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œ,1
"Great experience, better than Pandora & Sirius radio!",1
Best platform for listening advertisements,1

"Mostly works but recently I have had it playing songs not on the playlist, I waited a day before using the app again and I still can't skip the songs. also I do not like how it's adding songs automatically now.",0
"6 skips per hour, wow so i cant even skip to the song i want to listen to since it didnt let me just click on it to listen to that song. I aint gonna talk about the mass amount of ads and that skipping songs is a premium Feature. I feel like they only care about the money, not about the thoughts lf people. Id rather use Youtube Music since they let me play a certain song and not just a PREVIEW of it. Really dissapointed for such a large and wide spreaded app",0
"I can't filter my liked songs If I do manage to do it, it'll play random songs that are not even close to the chosen genre! It's really annoying when I want a specific mood at work",0
Have been enjoying Spotify for a few years. Always finding new things,1
"Its a great APP but NO MATTER what, You should get RID OF THE ad's whether you pay or not",0
Amazing family plan and selection,1
"I really love it but, the 30 mins uninterrupt listening??? Still ads",0
At first it just frustrates so much with ads for premium and then one day I took my premium free trial and it ended unexpectedly before even 24 hours. and i can't even choose songs to play anymore and even the playlists show distorted. I reached out to the spotify support and they told that every free account has this and they didn't even help. Its really unsatisfactory even the sudden changes and the support service.,0
Great all for streaming music. Been hooked on it for years now,1
"1 star if you dont pay for spotify premium, but 5 stars if you do. I really reccomend premium as it unlocks loads of more options. 100 percent worth the money for premium, also you can get family plans as well as premium duo which is just a version fof the family plan but just 2 people.",1
"I appreciate the effort of the team and like Oliver, l will ask for more especially the African traditional old school music of the 1960s/70s",1
"It's good at finding songs for you, sure. But there's so many bugs. Once it undownloaded all of my downloaded songs, thus creating the most boring aeroplane ride of my life. And I wasn't even in offline mode! All I did was turn my Wi-Fi off (after they had all downloaded). I also just got kicked out and can't log back in because I was in offline mode prior to be kicked out. I don't know how I'll log back in now.",0
It keeps stop playing music they need to get it together.,0
"Spotify premium is still my favorite music app. Where else would I be able to get three months of premium for just $9.99(for ALL three months). Best deal ever. Thanks for the ability to listen to anything I want ad Free! I've got to let you know, that you should definitely subscribe to Spotify premium today. Keep cranking out the tunes, we'll keep listening.",1
Spotify has fantastic music collections. Excellent music quality. I was recently introduced to this app by a friend of mine & I'm so in love with it.,1
"Best premium streaming music app I've used, nice job spotify",1
There the best music app. Out there!,1
The kareoke option is not working for me.I updated the app but still it doesn't work.It worked only once so I thought of doing it again but I don't have that option now,0
It's a great app honestly but it's just playing a piece of song and that's not what I want but please get rid of this feature because it's pisses me off,0
Please stop refreshing reccomendations and daily playlist so much during the day. It should happen at like 4 in the morning and not change! It is so hard to browse and find what I'm looking for.,0
App constantly crashes and now playing screen to pause no longer appears. FIX YOUR APP. This still continues despite the app being up to date. It's been months how is this still not fixed,0
"Great app, you can find eny song and good quality ðŸ‘Œ",1
The app is great though there are limited skips,1
"It is the best music application I have ever downloaded. I would give this app 4stars due to its problem of getting stuck. If i play my song and off the screen or come out of the app,the song will stop playing. Please fix this issue.",1
I can reply the same song I want to play and I have to listen to an album of one song I wanna listen to and I got logged out of my account randomly for no reason and it didn't save the account so this app meh it ok ig,0
Similar to other people - it seems to constantly be randomly stopping in the middle of songs and won't play I the background,0
Best interface for a podcast and music app by which any user can interact easily. It is also good in the field of education which helps the children in their studies. This app consists of many documentaries as well which enhance the knowledge of any person. Talking about the main part of this application which is 'Songs and Music' This app is considered as the best app which enables high quality content without much more interruption.,1
"I am having issues when I cast my phone to my TV or PS5, the screen freezes on the first song I play, it's froze on that screen whether I go back to the main page or not. Cancelled my sub after a year without resolution. P.S. pay musicians more $$$ for their exploited work.",0
Love Spotify and have been a paying user for a few years. Two issues that need to be addressed ASAP though that have been going on too long. Music plays in background and no way to pause it or skip even in the app. Pretends it's not playing....but it is. Also cannot access my downloaded podcasts when offline. It just keeps spinning. What is the point of downloading stuff when you can't access it offline??? Both issues happen on my old phone and new phone and my wife's phone as well. Please fix!!,0
after every song ads,0
Removed the feature to work with my car's stereo for no good reason.,0
2022 update: app is super slow to load playlist. Sometimes I have to close and reopen in order to see contents. 2021: App kept downloading using cellular even though the option is turned off. Burned through my data plan. Note 10 plus.,0
"The app is OK, you can only skip 6 times an hour, and adds pop up everywhere. With recent press about Joe Rogan's Covid-19 statements many artists are leaving so that is why I stop using the app.",0
PERFECT SOUND,1
Please move the play button back in the middle.,0
I have Samsung galaxy A21s but still I can't able to see Samsung premium offer in app's premium tab. Please help me.,1
To to to much ads.Just getting the song started and theirs an ad totally disappointed. And the thing is that after the update it started giving more ads after every song. And this is the third time I'm coming here to tell that it contains to much ad,0
W music app if you just get premium. Just get it bro it's goated.,0
I had my hopes high on a complete garbage app like this? Huh Trust me guys after 14 days this app transform into a complete hell So annoying and garbage You couldn't even choose what sing to pick You have limited chance to skip per hour Ads after every song finishes I gave 2 star because it was actually good for the first 2 weeks Just delete the app after 2 weeks lol That's what i'm doing,0
It's really annoying NC it keep going back fix the bug ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
Barely usable after the latest update (Samsung S20 4.0 one ui. Keeps playing music but doesn't show what's playing. Need to constantly force close the app and restart it to change songs. Issues with airpods pro /switching audio sources from Spotify to call and back. Please roll the update back.,0
Nice to listen to music while just walking,1
Well actually I have becomed my self as a premium user and now I can enjoy it.,1
Awesome app . Music glorious Lots if old songs thst u wouldnt expect they got ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯,1
"Been a Spotify user since it debuted, and loved it ever since.",1
Really good app for music earlier I used jiosaavn but for past 6 months I am using dis amazing app.,0
"Looks like they deleted my review or something, I hate it when it's like play random song on my playlist and I can't skip it to forward or backward, that's 2. Fix it and I'll change my mind, I mean all of the user, change they're mind",0
"Always the best music, has every song you can think of.",1
"I used to be fine with it on phone because i thought maybe it was hard to program being able to select single songs and rewind and stuff, and that xbox got those features because they have a deal with microsoft or something, but now when i was on my phone and xbox at the same time i learned that phone does have all the features to rewind and go back to last song, you just cant get those features unless youre on an xbox at the same time (or probably have premium), which makes no sense",0
Random songs just pop into my liked song playlist,1
Happy,1
Great APP! Many Playlists. I have found almost everything I have been searching for!,1
"All I can say is, I love Spotify",1
Amazing,1
Best app for music when you have premium!,1
I love Spotify don't know what I would do without it,1
"Can find most of music and podcasts that I am looking for, and discover plenty of new music and podcasts. Regarding Joe Rogan controversy... I will continue to use Spotify.... But I do feel Spotify needs to do more to monitor medical or scientific misinformation... No matter which political side it emanates from. [01/30/2022]",0
"I love everything about Spotify. Even the free version is amazing. The ability to organize the playlists, favourite songs, and just the overall presentation are perfect.",1
Kuch rimix song bhi diya kro,1
"The latest update broke the app. Now the music player controls (Play, Pause, Fast-forward, etc) are gone. I have to shutdown and restart the app to get the controls again, but they eventually disappear again. Please fix.",0
"Latest update automatically plays music upon opening the app when connected to a Bluetooth device??? EXTREMELY annoying, PLEASE allow an option to disable :(",0
I dont understand anything On Desktop its good but on Android its fully trash i will play a playlist and will Start at a song or at the Start? But no random mode is on and i dont know how to stop it. And then i will go back a song in my playlist no because everything is buggy and trash,0
"Great music, superb playlists",1
Best music app ever!,1
"The Spotify app is a great app to listen to whatever music you like from babies up to the elderly, there is reggae, country, rock, jazz, blues and so on. So if you like your music this the app to have.",1
Very best app all songs in premium demand ,1
Still the best music app. But: - no lossless - you can't minimize player by swiping like in ios version,1
"It would be great if there was a ""listen later"" feature that you could add artists your friends recommend to you in the moment.",1
Excellent work,1
App just bugs since newest update. The bar to pause/ play or jump music is not there 2 out of 3 times and I have to restart the app like 3 times every time.,0
Successfully uninstalled ,1
"Couldn't live without Spotify! Use it everyday, use it with my kids, listen to it at work, at home, and in the car! Love!",1
Good app,1
The ever increasing volume of identical ads and trailers drives me in sane,1
The songs are not playing. It shows the playlist is empty for all the album.,0
"Music stoped playing on Google Home and when casting to Android TV. Timer is working though, but no sound",0
Easy to use. Great selection of songs,1
Latest version has major issues on pixel 6. Now playing no longer works only way to stop is to force close the app. Virtually unusable. How can I roll back?,0
"trash. when first installed this, it went fine and normal. until the update came. i can't pick what to play and i can only play shuffle and you can't press the button to pick another one again. and so much ads :(( Everytime you play a song there's always ads. :(( you can't pick what to play and you always get random songs that you don't even want and you can't even change it :(( i literally have to do everything just to play what i want. unbelievable, im disappointed :< please change this.",0
"The apps doing really good on my end, although when I exit and play a song when I get back on the song doesn't show on the bottom. I wish we could pin more than 4 playlists on my library. Other than that I still love Spotify<3",1
"I am a Spotify premium user. I have listed the 2 main bugs that I occur. Firstly, if I have a weak internet connection. My app refuses to show any songs even though I have downloaded many of my playlists. This problem persists unless I turn of my connection to the internet. Secondly, with this new update, the media player in my app keeps dissapearing for Spotify and the song keeps playing without a way to stop or change the music playing unless completely stopping the app.",0
Nice to find such a variety,1
"Great music options, great audio quality (depending on output device but still), over all really good. Except for one thing... The fuction of using the phone as a controller for laptop, consoles, tvs, etc. Is absolutley horrible. I play a lot of video games on my computer so it being implemented so horribly affects me greatly since I can't always tab out to change songs. Some frequent problems are: songs not skipping, songs not playing, and the wrong song being displayed. If it worked solid 4/5.",0
"For a music lover, like me there is nothing better than this...",0
Tooooo much ads,0
I try to play the song on my Play list and Play songs I didn't add,0
The sounds and lyrics of songs are very enhanced. Kudos and never relent on improving,0
For me this app is very good for stories podcast and music I listen all my favorite songs,1
Please add a hide podcasts option. And please fix Spotify connect. It's always out of sync between phone app and pc app.,0
"You just deserve thatðŸ˜ I wish they added those ðŸŒŸ. Like 10 ðŸŒŸ, you just have to earn it. All what I wanted to listen in 1 place ðŸ˜ ðŸŽ¶",1
I use it all the time it's such a good app to listen to music on,1
"The app is ok but its not very helpful for long distance couples. You can make a family or duo account but you all have to live at the same address, what about people that want to share an account but are 4000 miles apart and need something to bring them closer together, we thought Spotify would do this for us but let us down badly ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",0
"Why do you keep adding random song to people's playlist??? We only want to hear songs we like, Not what you add randomly!",0
I have one account but I have been charged for 2 I just wish someone would respond back,0
Doesn't like it when I go from wifi to cell data. Forever having to force stop then restart the app again.,0
"Good music app, but still a bit frustrated about the experience. The recommendations are not really relevant. Spotify always pushes the same songs like an annoying radio playing 20 times a day the same song. Also user can't choose they preferred location, means you don't have easy access to the music from your country if you live abroad.",0
"Very good app!! I just wish they added a little player on facebook, so that when someone visits our profile they can hear what we're listening to at that specific moment.",1
I love it,1
Literally love this app and tbh Ive had no glitches in the system,1
"Ads for paying customers, podcast bloat everywhere, missing options that Apple users get. Spotify has gone downhill.",0
"I basically use this only for podcasts. It does the job well there, but needs to improve in then songs department. Most regional songs do not have lyrics. And the ads are annoying.",0
pls reduce ur ads some of us cant buy premium cuz their parents think its a waste of money.,0
"Love this app. All my music and podcasts in one place which makes it easy to use to any time and anywhere. The family account makes it great for us, partner and kids can all have their own place for what they like to listen to.",1
Nice app for song downloading....,1
"The app lately is horrible. So many small bugs, the music plays but when I open the app I don't see the buttons to stop or play backwards/forward. Having issues every time I plug any Bluetooth headset. Really annoying",0
The autoplsy is absolutely annoying and is bad fix this and many people will be happier,0
Play bar disappears. Need to force close it and then restart. Super annoying. Pixel 6 Pro,0
"After the update the app keeps on saying no wifi connection even though I can search for songs and everything. The downside is that, i can't access the lyrics, album, radio etc. My wifi connection seems to be working fine with 300mbps. I don't know what the issue is, it's been bothering me for the last week. Hence the 1sl star rating.",0
Always great quality. Always works great.,1
"Why did spotify remove the shuffle play?? Now it just starts or pauses the songs, nothing more. Really disappointed",0
Amazing but the reason why 3 stars u cab never find the right song sometimes,0
Beautiful app.. as I am very much fond towards musics ðŸŽ¶ I prefer this app the most as it can play music in the background...so I can do the other jobs ðŸ˜„ thanks,1
"Even though it was communicated that lyrics feature is available for all users globally, after more than 1 month later they still couldn't fix the issue with some PREMIUM members who still doesn't have the feature. I find this unacceptable. Please do something and fix the issue.",0
Can be better. Algorithms can be improved.,0
"I am a diehard Spotify fanatic who has been a very satisfied listener for several happy, headbanging years. Tune in, fade out, and keep jammin' Spotify. Thanks.",1
I've used Spotify for years and it's the best.,1
Can't listen to audio when adding songs to a playlist,0
In advertisement there is option for downloading song. But in that app it is missing,0
It's the best app for music that I've used over the years,1
"Getting a constant bug where every time i go back into the app, the music player won't show/load unless i force stop and restart the app. Can't find a way to fix it.",0
"There's a bug right now, when ever I renter the app I don't see the current song that is playing and I cannot change it or replay it I have to close the app and reopen it.",0
"Coming from an amazon music sub I am very impressed. The ultrahd in amazon music IS of higher quality, but their app is always crashing so I switched to spotify and will never go back. Spotify app stability has been 99 percent uncrashable so far. Music library is much larger, I do a lot of streaming at work so I need to be able to let it play for long periods without switching albums or playlists. As long as audio quality remains high and the app is stable I will be on nothing but spotify.",0
"I just bought premium 2 days ago and since yesterday the app just won't open. I've tried everything: force stopping the app, uninstalling then reinstalling, removing then retaining permissions. But it just stays stuck on the logo when I try to open it. I'm not having my money poured down the drain on premium for something that won't even open! Is there a way I can recover the app properly? I'm on android. Thanks.",0
I put 4 stars because we can't have more than 6 skips between songs it should be whenever Hope you change it,1
"the new update is horrible. it changed the app completely. i cant see what the next song is, the queue is gone, i cant play just one song if i want to and it adds random songs i dont want in my playlists. i cant turn shuffle mode off and it constantly repeats certain songs. and on top of that it STILL tries to get me to buy premium. what is even the point of buying it anymore?? im seriously disappointed.",0
Excellent all the music you could wish for...,1
Not sure why you cannot remove a song from a playlist in the options when on the song view . You can remove from playlist from the list view only - which is really frustrating. I have to now go back to my list view just to remove a specific track from the playlist? Makes no sense,0
Only down fall is it doesn't have all music especially of YouTube music,0
Annoying it doesn't even work properly,0
"Unhelpful update - used to be great app, but probably with last update I lost about to find and control what's actually playing. Stuck with home page overloaded with unhelpful recommendations",0
Pretty much bullet proof app. I bloody love Spotify..,1
Amazing experience but would like to increase the 30 minute advertisement ski0 time.,0
Beat ever,1
Worse app ever..!! If we search good song for caller tune. It's not available. They can't search know songs also sometimes Jio team makes everything for business. At first everything was free not they are charging for everything,0
Alot of ads but dose the job,0
lots of music aren't there.Eats up storage space like there's no tomorrow. and pointless without wi fi or internet. I'm looking forward to something better than this. Lately it randomly stops playing while I'm teaching a cardio fitness class and also looses the media control bar! :(,0
god is good,1
I think Spotify is one of the most welcome App I have for Music and I think it is great it is well worth having everything in music you you will need there is such large choice of music that will cover everyone's likes and choice of different music it is a must that you try and have this great experience of SPOTIFY,1
I'm unable to open app. If I go onto the internet I'm able to view my Playlist however I can't click on the app itself to take me there anymore which is frustrating.,0
"Many problems with this app. #1 You canâ€™t even play the songs you want. Every time I shuffle play liked songs or my own playlists it just plays songs that arenâ€™t even there. #2 Too much ads. #3 Whenever I search for a song, I have to go through every single playlist that appeared till I find the one I want, sometimes I donâ€™t even find it. #4 You have 6 skips every hour but canâ€™t even play what you want so I just skip to the song I want but then my skips are just wasted. You need to fix this.",0
The update is Soo bad. I can't pause or skip songs and it doesn't even let you listen to the song you want. This app was good before.,0
"Great interface with other apps!! Love you guys!!...Great sound definition too!! You clean up an original artists sound with augmentation to increase sound quality...well done!! So apps I have subscribed to leave me feeling very much ""let Down""...but not you guys. I am glad I have spent my money WISELY. To all you audiophiles out there check out this ""APP YOU WILL BE RIGHT BACK"".......I promise ..Great App!!",1
Love this app!!! Better then pandora.,1
Amazing,1
"It doesn't let me play what I want. However, it's nice app, but the new update is really annoying, I didn't use it for almost 3 days because of this. Please fix this.",0
I love this app. I would rather 5 but there are so many ads it's kind of annoying. I know there has to be some but it feels like there are more ads then music.,0
"It's like Pandora, but you can make your own playlist",0
"Hi, I changed my account to 2 accounts, the monthly fee went up but the changes didn't happen, when you don't do your job properly, how do you expect to receive the fee?",0
"What tha heck ?????? Spotify used to work but NOW, it won't play some of my playlists and if I want to check out a song before down loading it I have to go to another screen then comeback and click on it for it to work. What the heck heck is happening Spotify??????",0
"A very nice app, has many songs and playlists. Also has data data saving options.",1
I can't even loop my favorite song and others bro put it on premium for no reason bro ðŸ™„ sh*itty app,0
Its happy that all the songs i here are in Good Quality.please if Possible Get a Good Relationship with instagram and Your songs auido cant Be shared to instagram please Do this. Everytime i share a lyrics only the words are sharing the Audio is not hearing and it is Undesirable.,0
"Great options when choosing music. I am an all around listner so I losten to things from classic to rap, country, christen etc. Great choices of music. And I don't miss Neil Young. ( bye Neil ) Sorry folks.",1
it's great but please return the preview of the songs,1
"Spotify is awesome app for listening music but 1 give 1 star for a reason. Spotify should make account deleting more user friendly ,it is very difficult to delete multiple accounts.",0
It's different and better than Amazon music that you literally pay twice for I don't get it pay for prime get some music add unlimited and get all music dumb. I pay one set price and get the same stuff here on Spotify.,1
"Decent, when it works. It's always been buggy, but now it straight up deletes my offline music on my galaxy watch. One of the primary features of the app. It's like no one at Spotify does UAT before posting updates.",0
Love it just I dont like the recommended songs and then u get ton of playlist u dont like,1
Hard as hell to set up and when ever I use Bluetooth the sound automatically goes to quiet and there's no way to fix it,0
"I love this app But when i dont update it it says nothing playing. But now i had update it and it says nothing playing, when i click a music it still says no music playing.",0
Good music ðŸŽ¶ easy to find what you want to hear,1
"I like it it just works you know. It does what i need it to do, and i really appreciate that. keep it up.",1
"I absolutely love Spotify! Even though I technically have YT Music, and was an avid user or Play Music until its shutdown, I almost exclusively use Spotify for my listening needs. They make it so easy to discover new music and podcasts to listen to. Also, the Year end wrap-up is an awesome bonus. I would absolutely recommend Spotify to anyone, even though I wish the subscription was a bit cheaper, but that's just how things go I guess",1
The iPhone version is much more user friendly with guestures compared to Android where everything requires you to do a one more step to do what u want,0
Good ,1
Awful. OK on iPad but cannot get on my mobile,0
Spotify really gives me the groove while doing my tasks.,1
I'd rather just download the songs and listen it in my own music app y'all just spending money just to get rid for ads while your own music app doesn't have it plus the songs I want is not here even though it kind of takes some of your storage it's just like 3mb and downloading this one is 26mb or more plus when you use it more it will just increase that's it.,0
The free version of this app is missing key features that are in the PC version. There is no reason to not offer a comparable experience across platforms and seriously hurt my score of it,0
First time user. Enjoy the variety of music choices!,1
Why take out listening to the song clips when adding songs to your Playlist that's just kinda dumb,0
"Only joined to listen to Joe Rogan after all the publicity.. listened to a lot of his podcasts on other platforms.. I would NEVER Listen to the ""offended artists"" who threatened to leave anyway ðŸ¤£ will give more stars if it's a reliable experience.. but the reviews don't look good ðŸ™„",0
I really enjoy it. Making your own playlist listening to songs you love with new recommends. It amazing!!! Literally amazing!!! :) I would suggest a sleep mode where the music turns off after the prescribed time. I listen to music while sleeping and it would be epic to have it on spotify,1
"just a three, i like the music and everything but when i play the one i like it recommends something else I wanted to play this and switches to that I gave it three since i like it but yeah its still not good",0
Lot's of ad's,0
"You know the age old saying if it's not broken don't fix it? I have no idea what Spotify did in their last update, but its absolutely becoming rubbish the user hasn't any control over their ability to play, pause, skip music.. FIX IT DAMNIT",0
This is an extraordinary app.......i would love to get premium but.... only limited platforms for payments are available.....nowadays even non popular sites give a lot of platforms......it would be more convenient if you have Google pay...... please take in note of my request ( only for that reason I've given 3 stars ....or would be giving 5ðŸ’–ðŸ˜€),0
Super awesome. Been using it for years. No issues,1
"For the last few days, it has been acting up. It will play without the control bar on the bottom so I can't pause or skip songs. It will random stop and turn the music off, and won't allow me to play anything until I force stop the app and restart it.",0
Best music app you could find,1
This app is amazing and it's sound quality just wow,1
"I recently bought Spotify premium since the frequency of ads were annoying. But turns out, it's waste of my money. The app never opens up everytime I try to launch it, irrespective of the internet connection quality. Big thumbs down ðŸ‘ŽðŸ»",0
"Good app, well performing app. -1 star as ot won't stop auto-playing everything it connects car Bluetooth despite setting configurations.",1
It sucks for a music app it doesn't allow you to pick the song you want but if it's in your Playlist? It won't play that either. Likes? Not that either. And what if you just skip it? Only 6 skips per hour it's like the person who designed this never listen to music before. The whole apps sh!ty nothing about it works. And the ads the whole free for 30min thing lies.,0
"It's a great place for a podcast, music, and business. Spotify give you a spot to be yourself you'll able to choose variety selection of entertainment that you may like to listen to even watch. On scale 1-10 give company 9. I believe that it's fair and honest business. Keep doing the right things,, and growing and growing. Congrats!ðŸŽŠðŸŽˆðŸŽŠðŸ‘ðŸ‘ˆ",1
For the most part it works well. But after update now I can't preview songs. And I feel like the podcast now have more ads in them,0
"Was good, now frustrating to use. App never loads, only plays the Playlist I had last listened too. Uninstaller and reinstalled and still having a hard time loading. Always a black screen now. Not good, won't pay premium if it continues.",0
"I love this app coz there are lot of songs to listen. But I hate those Ads like they advertise on TV, why not advertise new songs or most popular songs in Spotify.",0
Really bad. Too many ads. Crashes a lot now.,0
What in the hell is up with your player? It freezes or disappears constantly this last month. Fix your app we're paying for this trash.,0
"What has happened with Spotify??? If you opt to shuffle a playlist it always plays in the same order. I have a 5+ hour playlist I have created and if you play for more than 2 hours it starts repeating songs in between, the other day I heard 2 songs 3 times in a 2 hour period",0
Something is happening my music will randomly stop while I'm listening to it. Fix this bug it was fine until yesterday.,0
its simply better thna anything but very complicated to chang plan,0
I have never had issues with Spotify before. But the recent update is really bad. The songs keep pausing on it's own and I have to kill the app and reopen to see the player on my screen. Please fix this because it's really annoying.,0
Maximum depravity commercials. Be ROMAN orgy ready! Love me some trash hip-hop while I am listening to Jazz or red dirt...... modern technology could tailor the commercials to the music genre being listened to but instead Spotify promotes depravity.......,0
"The app is great for all musical listening needs, downloaded or not. (Soundcloud not included) but recently it has an issue with app itself. - It would refuse to show the song playing on the pop-up and refuse to go to the Now Playing screen. - When scrubbing throuh the song, itll place itself at a time but won't skip to that particular time unless placed again or outright leaving the app. Otherwise it works just fine for listening.",1
"3 stars until I see an update to fix this issue. I love this app, I've been a paid subscriber for years, but for the love of God if I have ""unedited"" songs in my liked songs, Do Not! Switch them out for edited versions!...I'm 30 years old and if I wanted to hear the edited version of ""gin and juice"" I probably wouldn't be listening to r & b in the first place, please fix this has happened to me so many times!",0
Everything is good but pls give download for free,1
Best music app out there...it gets a feel for what you like and adds it to your listening. Very dope,1
I love this app and the variety of music and podcast it provides â¤,1
"You're driving me and my car insane. When music is playing and I go back into the app the player disappears like if nothing is playing, I have to completely close the app to make it reappear again. I've uninstalled and installed already.",0
Why is the play pause button way off to the left and the skip forward backwards are in the middle? Did someone misplace a 0 and a 1? It looks ridiculous and makes 0 sense why it's not skip pause skip like it used to be. P.S. If you're to cheap to pay to listen to your favorite artists you deserve ads. Expect a premium service for free? LOL,0
Amazing,1
I have this app in my phone. But after 1 mo. it stopped in my car. Saying it is free + built in my $800. phone why does it say I need to pay $10. a month. Confused!!,0
It's great to listen to a music play list when your busy. Great tunes.,1
Constantly crashes the UI but keeps playing. Must be force closed.,0
The ads suck and don't even get me started You get 6 ads for an hour you At least a 100 so it's really hard To use the app I enjoyed it the 1st couple days but then ads started rolling going in and then it it sucked so yeah Just take this advice,0
I mean you know it's freaking spotify so I don't think that you need any explanation at all,0
Latest update has made the playlist section unnecessarily complicated. Edit updated: Now an update has removed the ability to listen to local files on my laptop on my phone.,0
"Don't get me wrong I like using spotify but it gets soo annoying when you are trying to listen to an album or a playlist and spotify just adds random songs, like let me listen to my stuff. Spotify has to add a function if you want the random songs or not. I know most people can agree ðŸ‘ ðŸ’¯",0
Spotify used to be great but recently the app has begun to fail to load content or find search results. I've been a premium subscriber since the very start however if the issues aren't fixed soon I'll be leaving the platform entirely as it's become incredibly frustrating.,0
Keeps auto playing when I get in my car . There is no fix . Gonna delete ..hopeless.,0
"I love the app; plays what I want and starts playing similar music so I can find new stuff which I love HOWEVER lately it's doing this glitchy thing where after 5 or 6 songs, it just cuts out and sort of crashes and you have to close it all down and restart it.",0
Spotify meets my needs beautifully. Thank you.,1
Amazing music app qlways has the newest songs and a lot of the really small artist,1
Great music app which is richfully filled to the brim of all genres and types of music both obscure and popular which is great.,1
"Fix this app. Everytime I'm playing music, it automatically stops playing then restarts the song completely over. This recent updates are garbage. Bring back old spotify",0
Not easy to use at all. Attempting to play a song would play a 'recommended' song instead. Desktop is way easier to use,0
"I love it â£ï¸, it's my fav music app. Actually I'm using Spotify for my BTSðŸ’œ",1
I really enjoy this app. The weekly discovery is awesome!,1
"Major glitches recently. Frequently freezes/stops playing mid track. Even more annoyingly loses the ability to pause or stop playing, even when you close the app. The only solution to this is uninstall and reinstall the app. Terrible issues for such a big company, especially when they charge a monthly fee! Should have been sorted as soon as the problems became apparent.",0
"Ads are too many, too often, and too long. Very annoying and you can't fast forward thru the commercials.",0
A very good one app tjat i found without publicities while listenning,1
I honestly like it but there is a problem that when i want to play one of my liked songs instead of the song i picked it puts on a whole different song then i cant change it back to the song i picked. May you please fix it.,0
too many adverts on my pixel 2xl causing the app to crash,0
I like it the only problem I have is most songs don't have lyrics,0
I can't play song as I want when I play playlist songs it starts shuffle playing and I can't stop it I don't no what it is an error or something else I also delete this app and download it again and again but same things happens it's just happening on my mobile not on my Android tv.,0
App keeps crashing on my vivo x60 android 12 os,0
Easy to find what music you like.,1
I love it because all the anime songs are in hereðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜ðŸ‘ðŸ»,1
"player bar not showing up anymore, player very buggy",0
"I started using this app under the recomendation of my brother. It was a good run but now cause of too much ads on the free verson, ads came up between every single songs and play about 3 ads and then play 1 song. I could'nt enjoy the songs as much because of too much ads conclusion. 4stars.",0
"Good app, but full of issues since the latest update a few days ago. The music stops every few seconds and the playlist disappears from time to time.",0
Good app for music But should make music downloadable without premium,0
Very good to listening music just wish you could download songs for free,1
"Spotify is great and I don't mind ads every once in awhile but the ads are starting to get excessive. I swear it feels like I'll listen to three songs and get three ads after. Sometimes even after the ""30 mins of uninterrupted listening"" ad I'll get an ad two songs later.",0
VERY BAD. i have used spotify for so long and now its lagging alot! I search a song thst i like and after i press the play button alot of other songs come up!!!! I have to say my excperince on spotify is a 0 out of 10.,0
Glitch which causes music to stop and cannot see what song is playing,0
Noting to say more...just could be even more perfect if hade mp3 download file,0
"they were unexceptionally smart to give me spotify premium free for 3 months... after that 3 months i couldn't bear with the ads and i literally became a premium member for good. its the best music streaming app but fyou for taking my money by playing mind games. jk just buy premium duo with a friend, its affordable.",1
This is the worst app I've ever seen in my whole life omg. I'm littrrally anoyed by this app. Lots of ads and it took me 2 hours to find the music i want because it keeps playing random musics that i didnt even want to.,0
Very fast and amazing,1
all good! But please - stop making changes every time!,0
30 minutes free music no ads.,0
"Amazing app indeed!! The reason I gave 4 starts, Its because the Advertisement's totally ruin the vibe. Well after all, U can get premium and listen add free and much more.. :D!",0
"Hasn't worked since last update, cancelled subscription - Apple music actually works.",0
It is one of the best apps I have but it have so many ads and it keeps showing me no network but my network is working properly and my app is updated to the latest version,1
Spotify is better but one problem I am facing is internet is on but app is showing you are off line because of this iam not hear song,0
"Well, I've been using the Amazon Music app that is about ten dollars a month. Spotify is way more up my alley. Lots easier to populate your lists. Helpful suggestions. High bit rate sounds great! The thing is, I'm listening to classical music.",1
Give a Alphabet scrolling option in playlist...Otherwise app is great,1
The sound is good and optional,1
Good music,1
"My spotify suddenly started bugging out, I have to open the app a lot of times before it starts working normally as it keeps on crashing. Hope this could be solved",0
I have paid 7rs for one day just to check the app...it did not activated at all...,0
Songs stop playing in the middle of a track and goes to other devices. Re-installed app started happening after new update... still does it intermittent plays on Bluetooth... re installed 5 times. ... not impressed,0
"I have waited through several updates to get on here and complain because I figured they would have fixed this by now, but the only reason I use Spotify is for podcast and almost every time I'm streaming a podcast the app will jump to the end of the podcast within about 10 minutes of having started it. Then I have to find where I was, usually causing me to have to pull over. This has gotten absolutely ridiculous",0
Got everything,1
"Control panel not displaying so unable to stop anything from playing, so having to reset phone instead",0
I love this app but I wish some artists were available to stream such as Atheist. As a big metal fan and music fan finding out some songs and artists aren't available to stream sucks. Please Please please allow these to be available,1
SPOTIFY IS MY DAMN JAM!!! I'D PICK IT OVER ANY OTHER MUSIC APP OUT THERE ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THEY HAVE ADDED THE LYRICS TO SONGS!!! My only request is to have the option to keep ur smartphone screen awake if u have the lyrics pulled up!! Love love love you Spotify Folk!!!!,0
All song available thank you this app,1
Great selection of music whenever you want to brighten your day,1
Awesome great music.,1
One of the best platforms to listen to my favorite Podcasters!,1
"What's not to love about the Spotify app. This one has everything - easy access to just about any music you want to hear, a great way to construct playlists and share them, and, if you should run out of ideas about what to listen to next, Spotify will conjure up spot-on recommendations for you.",0
Great platform but app is bugging out. Won't show music that is being cast and has been freezing up.,0
"Annoying, mostly use it for podcasts but app either stops the show for no reason or switches to a different show randomly. Every show multiple times! Reinstalled app no change. Samsung s21 ultra",0
Why am I shown ads when I have paid 799 Rs for the whole year. I know the purpose of advertisements but I really don't need it for God's sake.,0
"Since my phone did an update in early May (Samsung A20) Spotify won't work. I've already contacted Spotify and they claimed they'd work on it. But it's been a month, still no fixes. Cannot use the Spotify app, nothing plays, my Playlist is gone.",0
Since the update. Spotify has change layout on mine and not on other people I know. Also doesnt play the right songs that are in the album of playlist. As play artists and songs that are not in the playlist or album. Edit: Still the same set up and its shuffling albums and play music from artists that aint put in playlist. Also playing music from different artists even tho in a specific artist album.,0
"I liked this music app but recently I noticed if I click on a song I want to listen to, it plays a random song instead! Example: I click ""miss you"" and it plays ""what's next"". This never happened before! What is going on here?",0
Awesome app for music and podcasts,1
"Literally use this app everyday! I have premium so it is a little better but it has so many different music varieties and I don't have any adds, plus it loads instantly! Great way to listen to musicðŸ˜Œ",0
"Lots of music, but crashed occasionally on my last android (a moto z)",0
Its a good music app and I have spotify premium but when I listen to music lately its been constantly putting the volume down and its only spotify that does this it's not my phone thats the problem.,0
Needs patches desperately! The app randomly disconnects from the playing song and refuses to pull up any song or podcast from the app without restarting.,0
"This app...why are things always broken now that worked fine years ago. I create a queue last night. But today I'm in a different mood & click on a particular artist's station. Only one song plays from their station before it defaults back to last night's queue. Why? Just because we wanted to sing ""Loving You"" at 3am drunk last night doesn't mean I want that drunken memory overriding what I want to listen to today poolside. Why not an option after the app has been completely closed?",0
"i am genuinely very disappointed in the ads, they come way too often and at the worst moments. i was about to cry but the ad came or i was crying and got interrupted by the ad, whatever the case, still bad. I cannot express enough how much i hate the fact that you have added these ads and i hate them with my whole heart and i hope you stop them. no, i won't buy premium i don't have money for that don't even think about mentioning it. just never dare put ads again they are a very bad experienceto",0
I am so glad to hear songs ðŸ’œðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽ¶,1
LIKEE,1
"I've been a premium subscriber for years now and usually Spotify worked fine. But recently it's been awful. When I open the app and play music sometimes it takes a good 10 seconds to play and the animation when I press on a song is glitched, so it dims it and stays like that. And when it does play, ""the now playing"" doesn't even show up. So I can't pause or skip without going into my notification bar. Fix this now this is ridiculous! I'm about to switch services coz it's been over 6 months now!!",0
Wonderfully easy app to use which has huge flexibility and amazing features many of which I have not used properly yet. Highly recommended for anyone who wishes to have audio playing as part of their life.,1
Simply best !! Songs for all moods !! All types of songs,1
"I accidentally listened to a podcast I have zero interest in, and now I get notifications for it every time I open the app, with no way to delete, hide or remove it.",0
I can hear properly every songs mostly those whichs are I like to listen Alhamduli-Llah,1
I love it the best music app thanks,1
"Use this app everyday and have been for years. I like that I can create plsylists & share them. It is definitely worth getting the subscription. I use it for running & workouts. I've never had any issues, even when I change phone. Would recommend ðŸ‘",1
Love this app!! I wouldn't chose any other music app!,1
"Phone remote to tablet to stereo(s), excellent programming. Excellent entertainment. Spotify is so good you just might quit watching tv...Fantastic playlist generator, and perfect operation with only 2G of freespace. And You, You will have fun-guaranteed-and thats just the free version. Home cache clear.",1
As an independent artist I believe Spotify is so waytogo keep up the good work!,0
Never have I ever experience such a WONDERFUL app. I'm glad to have the good fortune of being able to enjoy it! Thank you for your attention to your customers Spotify.,1
"App doesn't allow me to view downloaded songs most of the time. App has many other bugs with downloaded songs. When I have bad service, no songs will play. Worst phone - pixel 4xl Droid 12",0
I love Spotify except you have to get premium for the best possible experience definitely better than Apple music and other music apps,1
"It's annoying I've been trying to add a debit card for the past 4months now, no way I've tried all my cards yet no way it keeps saying payment failed",0
"I absolutely love this app. It's the only music app that does exactly what I want and need; almost! The biggest complaint I have is if I miss a payment or I'm late, I can't play my play lists or listen offline, and it will start to kick you don't off your songs while your listening to it. Which I think is ridiculous. Other than that I love me some Spotify!!! ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜",0
"Love this app but since the last update the app has weird bugs. Songs stop and start playing constantly, tapping a song plays it but doesn't show the bottom nav (can't pause or do anything else)..and the app revives and starts playing in the car even after being force shut.",1
I can't see and control album tracks .. it only shuffles! Is this because i am in free trail. It's so annoying.,0
The absolute best way to find all of the music you love!,1
"Features & algorithm OK, but layout is one of the worst especially if you are serious about music. Actively seeking alternatives. Shame really :/",0
Was working well until the newest update. It bow looses sync and won't display what is currently playing unless I close the program and restart it.,0
Have used the app for years no issues now all of a sudden all my songs have vanished and I can not play anything on the app. Very frustrating was on support Chat for 3 hours and got no where with them!!! I now can not use the app on my phone and have to go thru the internet. ðŸ˜¡,0
Very annoying ads.. Ads are ok in between 2-3 songs.. But they put in between each song,0
"I used to really love this app, so I ended up going Premium. However, for a few months now there has been countless problems. Music or podcasts constantly pausing, the bar where you can skip or pause constantly disappearing. I've contacted Spotify and done everything they've asked, but nothing works. I think they need to admit there is a problem with the app that needs fixing.",0
Great app. All my music is easy to find. Plenty more music to choose from too.,1
SUPERPOWER,1
"Now I have a new problem, when I'm listening from my liked songs, it doesn't let me find anything, I type one letter and it already says there aren't any matches",0
Frame drop is too much,0
Dude i just suggests them a and i didnt pass my free 3 month trial time and they cut my free time on after i gave 5 star rating f u buggers i have remind all the songs again ðŸ˜,0
Amazing - I can honestly say that Spotify has changed my life for the better and is well worth the price of a subscription,1
It's great apart from the triple ads.,1
"PLEASE STOP PUTTING RANDOM SONGS IN MY PLAYLISTS, I HATE THAT, LIKE, I'M OK WITH THE ADS AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF BUT PLEASE STOP THAT, IT'S ANNOYING!!!!!! Thank you <3",1
Six skips per hour pfff you can't even enjoy and when the playlist ends they choose some similar musics which we dont want to listen to at all,0
"I truely enjoy Spotify i was able to find artists and songs i couldn't on Trebel, i am glad i installed it.",1
Rubbish I don't know if it updated or something but you can't play a specific song anymore,0
App continuosly quits and and malfunctions. I used to recommend it to everyone. Now I have decided to stop using the app because of its issues.,0
I really love listening to music with it,1
awesome to chill listening to what ever you want,1
Love the range of music; covers all Genres & Tastes :),1
Can't find saved playlists on latest android update,0
*update* after transferring to my SD card....today (2 days after) Spotify is in the process of transferring all downloads back to internal storage even though my SD card has more available space!!! Fix this issue Storage on SD card When will you fix the issue with transferring data to SD cards? Every single time I transfer storage to my SD card the app crashes. It's been like this for years now. Fix this dang issue,0
"Pros: it typically has the songs your looking for typically, has good audio quality and balancing, the suggested music is typically relevant to what your listening to currently and you don't have to listen to them on shuffle and can backtrack music ifyour a free listener now. Cons: the free to listen experience still feels purposefully miserable in order to make you pay to use basic functions you can use normally on pc and way to ad heavy",0
It is reallt good you can connect it to anything love it and i can play any song i like so ya,1
Excellent sound quality â£ï¸,1
Spotify is not working,0
This app is amazing. You. Can listen to quality music anytime any where,1
"please make premium purchases on Spotify, you can use credit because there are people who don't have a debit card",0
"This is the 2nd time I am experiencing a technical glitch while opening this app. The app is not getting opened as usually. When it happened for the first time I uninstalled it,when I reinstalled it worked fine but within a week I am facing a similar issue. I hope this issue is addressed.",0
would be great if there's an option for me to change the sequence of songs in the playlist from my phone itself,0
I've used Spotify for many years and enjoyed it. But for several months now it has been so glitchy that I'm am thinking I have to move to a different app. It's super frustrating to have it freeze constantly or be so slow it's not worth using. I'm having to force close the app and reopen it several times a day. Even uninstalling and reinstalling has not remedied the problem.,0
Ive had this app for over 6 years i think and to this day i still havent found any issues with this subscription service Updated I have found one issue now The shuffle doesnt shuffle all of my music Just the first 100 or so that I had recently added Rarely do I hear music is added years ago Other then that Still super solid,1
I will say ever since I got turned onto this app I really dig this music that they play and I get to pick from... as a matter of fact I'm listening to SPOTIFY right now I will be getting the premium in a couple days I don't like the commercials but I recommend TO everybody THAT THEY should download this app and listen to it!!!,1
Can't seem to get the song that is playing currently to open on the screen which is frustrating,0
Listen to your music faster instead of going to Listen to your music on YouTube go to Spotify,0
good,1
It's good . The only negative thing is the ads . The ads are mainly just their premium which removes ads but the only ad is the premium. It doesn't make sense,0
I'm a huge music fan I love anything I thought this would be a good music service for me to download and listen to but I just did a master factory reset on my phone last night and found out that everything I try and play something from spotify the ads continue to be playing for more than the desired time to be played I cannot click on a list of artists to listen to I have tried deleting my account with spotify but all I get is welcome back to spotify it's ANNOYING WISH WOULD FIX,0
"Spotify is a very good App, has archive of genre",1
Most recent update messed up the app. Now some songs will randomly restart and music controls will disappear with no way to pause or stop the song without force closing the app. Sometimes two songs will play at the same time.,0
"Been using it for years and paying for premium and all of the sudden I can't play anything at all without the app crashing. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling repeatedly, nothing helps. So now I guess I'm paying for nothing until this app gets a fix.",0
"Good selection of songs, and playlist is easy.",1
"Hello, I noticed the app, whenever I paused it, then will try to play it again, the play button or recently playing is gone",0
Every song is in here and every Artis this the best app ever all the music ðŸŽ¶,1
"Overall a good app for music! I give it 4 stars only because it glitches more than usual since I've actually downloaded the app, but I could give it a 5 star rating!",1
I've found a ton of obscure music that I used to listen to that I thought was lost forever. Absolutely love Spotify.,1
Good but too much ads and in increasing order everyday and also player screen isn't in landscape mode,0
I like this music app very much â¤ï¸ but I get to listen very time premium Premium I hate it,0
Able to find any and many songs in any catagorie.,1
The best damn music app out there. Try it or be STUPID it's up to you!,1
It won't let me play my music I'm deleting this app if you don't change it back were you can just scroll down to a song you like and play it,0
Free version is barely functional. Spotify needs to provide more of my $$ to artists before I go back to a paid acct.,0
"Stop asking for Bluetooth access, this is getting ridiculous.",0
"Keeps stopping, and I can't find the song I'm playing, can't stop or change what I'm listening to. This is just in the last couple of days so hopefully can be fixed.",0
Well I loved it at 1st... Then after trouble I had to contact you guys... 1 st few times was good then the last few times I was wondering if the folks I was talking to even had a clue... after being told twice I would have to manually download my whole list again I threatened to Terminate... Then decided to try one more time and was able to get all my songs back with ZERO HELP FROM YOUR TECH SUPPORT... I'm still in the fence about leaving...,0
love itt maybe cut the ads for free or have a skip button for ads like how youtube music has and your rates probably will go even higher no disrespect by the way <33,1
Usually I use use spotify daily but recently there's been a glitch and it just shows the logo when I open it and it doesn't work. I've tried doing things to my device to try and help it but nothings working.,0
This very.. nice app.. for music.. and podcast.. And their are many artists.. you make own playlist.. ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚,1
Love this app been using it for a couple of years no problems found at all,1
Good,1
I really love Spotify but the recent Bugs just destroy the experience. The music just stops sometimes and u cant control the music unless u restart the App. Also it sometimes just plays a random Song of the Playlist or just skipps to the end. I hope they fix these Problems fast.,0
"I can never sign in. It always says ""something went wrong"". Its annoying. When it does work it is good.",0
"A world music collection at the touch of your fingertips, simply amazing!",1
"Love the amount of music available and the download option. However, after every update it always breaks the app, this months issue includes music playing but not showing what is playing. Closing the app 3 to 5 tines fixes it. Updates never fix anything",0
"Great service, you can find almost every song you're looking for on here but there are some exceptions like I am unable to find songs of various artists like Echoes by Pink Floyd and so.",0
Spotify has been the best so far... The music has been great... I get whatever I want...Old and new...International and local too....,1
Best app ever,1
"Trash. Sorry if this offended you, but like you've made this app a full pay-to-listen app. I MEAN WE CAN'T EVEN CHOOSE THE SONG WE WANT TO HEAR, WE GOT TO LISTEN TO THE WHOLE PLAYLIST TO FINALLY HEAR THE SONG YOUR LOOKING FOR. What is even the point of this? I would rather use youtube. I am sure many can relate... I am disappointed Spotify, very disappointed... '-'",0
"Very comprehensive catalogue of music. The one thing that would improve the experience would be the ability to ""insert"" songs into playlists at a specific point rather than having to delete/remove songs and start again.",1
It good but to repeat ur favorite u have it get premium,0
It's the best music service ever!,1
App is not helpful to access and change account in the setting,0
"Borderline unusable these days. Controls not showing up after you hit play, things I've downloaded take forever to show up when I'm offline, playback stops randomly almost every 15min, really hard to play local files. The only reason I haven't cancelled my subscription is that I dont know of any other alternatives that do what I need. Fix these stupid bugs or I'm out.",0
Pretty good app but can have some improvements on videos,1
Undoubtly the most user unfriendly app ever. Search results and playlists don't play properly. Instead random other songs are added (why?!!) which cannot be skipped after a few. Can't start song from beginning or fwd or rewind. Horrible. The worst part is that it seems unpossible to start a playlist (mine contains only 1 song) from the the beginning. So after my 1 song I'm stuck with random songs that I don't want to listen to! Most frustrating experience.,0
"Love the Discover Weekly! Plus Spotify even has tons of international songs, even old traditional ones that are hard to find elsewhere.",1
Poor music site with bad ethics. They were better in the past but the direction they went over the past 4 years is just a bad user experience. There are better music app services. Don't recommend at all.,0
It really sucked to have it without unlimited though it was nice to play over other apps u could do that and more with other apps I will probably soon find something better,0
The best music app it's got awsome audio quality and I'm just like so amazed by this app,1
I wish they gave you more than just 6 skips per hour. But overall it is a great all just wish there was more skips. Is app is really wonderful and you find most songs that you can't find on any other app,1
Got a new phone and installed the current app. Doesn't show currently playing song now and pauses after a few minutes of playing. Unusable.,0
"Lowered to 3 stars, very disappointed in Spotify's decision to keep Rogan podcast over Neil Young's music. Even considering to cancel service soon. Yes an amazing music streaming service but now so dissatisfied.",0
What more can you ask for with more music than Pandora just as easy to search as a YouTube way better radio put together and then any other app all in one with playlists and uncountable amounts of music to search and keep. This app is a must-have and a One-Stop shop for anything music podcasts or whateverthat you need,0
This aplication when it gots update is even worse Clearly my internet is strong but it sets to offline Wth Are you trying to scam or want me to throw my phone because of your this shttiy new features Well get well soon,1
"I've been using this app for 8 years now, I love it. I'm pretty biased against other music apps so my opinion might not be the best x3",0
"Down from 5 to 3 stars: because your app no longer seems to handle restarting the same song consistently... I'm playing along with a piano player's song on here, and I am only practicing the first 35 seconds or so right now, and restarting the song is roughly <60% successful. I have to completely change songs then change back to what I want... So in the last 5 mins, this has put me over the edge. Please fix. And yes I am up to date on phone software and Spotify updates.",0
For me it's very cool music app,1
It's previous update update was better. Now when I play a song it doesn't play the full song. The song starts from the middle and plays for few seconds,0
I like spotify because it is much easier to find songs and songs i love it contains all the music i love and it does not lag or any of those sort i love spotify and thankyou for putting effort un it,1
Best music app easy to use and smooth,1
"Great app but my only problem is that when I play a song it won't play or it'll stop 30 seconds into the song,but the podcasts work well and don't stop. Which is disappointing since I just bought premium. ;-;",1
At first i liked it but now i just cant deal with it stopping my music and i have full connection itll play a song through part of the beginning of it then just stop then i have to skip to the next song and itll do the same but ill get lucky and a song play fully through but the song after it just doesnt even start playing and upgrading to premium didnt give much of a differance.,0
"I'm a paying customer and I don't want podcasts, make it so it is possible to disable podcasts.",0
"It's becoming so glitchy , I can't see liked songs , it's overall annoying and irritating and I have paid for PREMIUM ! It was so smooth before. I can't see the song I'm playing no controls whatsoever. Spotify lite is working better for me but the format is a bit diff so it's hard to adjust. Please fix this .",0
Removed features being used by the client base without any notice. Rather go to YouTube music then continue paying Spotify money. Bring back Spotify connect function and I'll take my review back.,0
I would give it a 5/5 yk and no its not because of too many ads its because it wont let me play music! everytime im looking for a song i cant click on it to see if its the song i like. it has no play button,0
Amazing if ure stressed about something,1
"It says that you can loop songs. I looked all over my screen and couldn't find the loop button. And when I turned off visuals for looping, nothing changed!",0
"Latest update broke the app. The navigator disappears, making pausing/playing unavailable, even through headphones buttons.",0
why do you give so many updates!? its so annoying that when I'm listening to the music the app updates automatically and stops the music. Instead of giving updates frequently just update the app whenever necessary.,0
"It consistently refuses to play offline, even when I've told it to download a song while having a connection. It doesn't seem to be deleting the songs, considering the space it's devouring on my phone. So that tells me its designed with hostility for the sake of subscription obsession. Good music selection. So there's your star.",0
Bring the Settings icon back to the home screen. Why confuse android users with it being hidden in the profile section?,0
This app is definitely nice and I can relax some times in them after the long times of studying:3 Many thanks to Spotify's our DirectorðŸ’—,1
Don't need CD's any more(now old technology) . So easy to use and navigate this music platform.,1
"I've never had many complications with this app! It has too many functions to count, and almost has everything I search for",0
I've used it for years. Even without premium there aren't many ads so it's ok to listen without it.,1
All my favorites and great variety.,1
They finally added music download availability for the Fossil gen 5 Carlyle. Thank you thank you Spotify it's sooo helpful,1
All good,1
Am giving Spotify 5star cause they gave me what I want so far,1
Best app to listen ðŸŽ¶ music on,1
"In my opinion, Spotify is a great app to listen to. Though it may not have a few songs, I like it.",1
Everything is good but the ads suck.... Earlier it used to be like 1 ad and then no ad for next 30 minutes but not there're too many of them and only once in a while there's one ad and then no ad for 30 minutes....,0
After every song there are two ads and you know that I am not listening to songs I am listening to ads what they say,0
Poor user interface. You have to wait >10s for albums to load even when offline. Why does the app keep trying to connect when in offline mode and phone airplane mode??,0
there's something wrong where audio effects won't appear,0
You are not responsive. I dont like ur service. I will not continue my premium account if you continue to ignore Lisa's song breach problem. We need you to fix it.,0
Spotify really needs to develop a way to show what's attempting to download. This app has been stuck at 16% download for the past two days. It's a waste of my battery and annoying to continue to look at. The app is up to date. I'm not having any problem streaming music. I'm not having any issue with any other app. My original complaint about this is from 2019 and apparently Spotify isn't that concerned.,0
"Guess you didn't want my honest review, thanks for deleting you creeps. This app would be fine if it weren't for the inescapable unpredictable ads, I listen to music to calm down and this app causes more distress than it's worth, at least on YouTube I can listen to the songs I want and can skip ads.",0
Worst.. So many albums were I finding since 3 years it was still corrupted.. Even if I contacted with spotify..,0
Excellent ðŸ‘Œ... Good for burning calories....,1
"1)Only app in my phone that takes 50-60 secs to launch. 2) It says ""enjoy the next 30 minutes of UNINTERRUPTED music"", and proceeds to show an ad every 5 minutes. Pathetic app",0
5 stars only when I have the option to share lyrics in stories it doesn't make sense to not be able while other people can,0
"Used to be great but so many bugs at the moment. If the screen locks the track pauses and you have to unlock to carry on. You can't always press the green play button on a playlist or album, you have to go back out and press the smaller play button. Little irritating things that make it not worth subscribing anymore.",0
"Pretty good to be honest, by far one of the best streaming platforms i've used so far. Especially when it comes to playlists and discovering new artists related to my music taste it goes beyond expectations. Couldn't have given it any other stars than 5ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸ”¥",1
This is the best app to listen musin,1
"Nice mixes, but I wonder who came up with the genius idea to force sync music between devices. I'd like to listen to separate stuff on my PC and smartphone, instead I have to constantly switch playlists. Also, no idea why you don't allow viewing previous songs in the queue. I thought that YouTube music had bad UX, not so sure anymore.",0
"Honestly, I just prefer Pandora. I find it easier to use, I like the free premium sessions, and it doesn't have as many ads. Nothings wrong with the app, I'm just not a fan.",0
"Other than random bugs ,this is my go to music player",0
"Very great. When you listen to music, it shows you the demo music video. Best app",1
"Great app, but the music keeps stopping. And its getting on my nerves. :(",1
I would give it a 5 but everything I get in my Benz it starts playing on my phone. I wish I could prevent it from playing on my phone. Will have to drop paid version if I can't figure it out.,0
Excellent choice for music service,1
I love making my own playlists and the ability to play them back in the car using Android Auto hands free.,1
I used to use Spotify but it is a good app but in my opinion audiomack is better to be honest frfr,1
"I like this app because of the HUGE variety of songs I can download. The problem I have is that if I pause it for too long, it disappears from my notification bar so I have to enter the app to make it play again. I have a LG Stylo 5. Both the phone software and app are up to date. With the update today (5/27/22) the widget no longer works. The widget is greyed out with the message ""problem loading widget"".",0
Shuffle function very annoying! I can't listen the song that I want to hear ðŸ˜‘. Please fix this problem ASAP!!!,0
I love Spotify and all but recently whenever I want to add songs to a Playlist I'm unable to preview it anymore please fix this bug (if it's now a premium thing I didn't know),0
Excellent sound quality. Search engine is relevant and swift. Great app,1
very good qpp for music,1
I would like to have more podcasts in russian language and easier ways to find them,0
"I realy love listening spotify its convinient for me , everytime that i want to play my fav music , its easy to find the songðŸ’•",1
I have begun to have problems. Sometimes it just stops working. It used to work in background. Now it just stop when I name using another app. It never did this before. Dies anyone have the same problem? Do you have a solution? Peace,0
"I use Spotify daily, couldn't live without it. It occassioally crashes and this needs to be fixed but i still enjoy the music and podcasts Spotify makes avaliable",1
Newest update sucks. Not sure what happened but now the app no longer tells me which song I have playing nor does it allow me to pause. I wear headphones at work and can't keep pulling my phone out to scroll thru a Playlist to change songs or close the app to make it pause. FIX YOU APP OR REVERT BACK TO HOW THINGS WERE BEFORE THE UPDATE,0
Heart button functionality still broken and lately music that is Now Playing will disappear from the bottom of the screen if you exit the app and you have to force close for it to re-appear. Happens every few minutes. I always have to click the options button for a song or album to add/remove it to/from my library with the heart button not actively turning green either since it's broken. Samsung Galaxy S10 running Android 10.,0
"You should be able to have collaborative Playlists that only certain people can edit but anyone can see. It's annoying that if I want to have a collaborative Playlist, I have to be careful with whom I share it with so they do not edit it. Needs permissions for certain user levels for editing, viewing etc",0
"Latest update the play bar is missing and the music randomly stops. Has been almost 2 weeks since the update, pls fix this",0
"This app is the most ridiculously imposing app, forces you to upgrade to premium, and when you don't you lose control of your playlist, anything could pop up and you can't next nor skip. Worse music app ever.",0
very good app for listening to music,1
"I get mostly good service with Spotify, I unfortunately think premium is a SCAM. I pay for premium and most of the time do not get my music on demand, I don't have to do shuffle play however I have these instances where I can't skip song or play songs sometimes unless I'm connected to internet when Spotify premium technically shouldn't need wifi! Thats what I literally am paying for!",0
I have been using this amazing app for 2 years now and I have no complaints.I have never used a better music app in my life.,1
The best music service I ever tried.,1
Have good music listen to it and u can shut off ur phone and it still plays even when sleeping.,1
Ads and limited skips??? Come on Spotify. You are going to lose customers now. The reason I left Pandora was the ads and skip limits!! NOT HAPPY!!,0
Not even worth it for non-premium people let alone people that dish out cash on this intensely broken app I recommend anything else even scrolling through my built in ringtones is a better option then this app if it was possible 0/10,0
"Cant play my downloaded songs. Keep on loading. Did every troubleshooting I know and could find of. This have had happened many times, and I'm sick and tired of it. Won't delete again a dozen GBs of Music. I'll just wait for the app to resolve itself.",0
"Editing after years of use: the app itself is terribly maintained, but the service is still great. I would hope a company this big would not be rolling out updates that introduce bugs to essential features and then leaving it like that for at least a week.",1
"Like others, been having really annoying bug issues lately. Mostly the play/pause bar disappearing and having to close/restart app to get my current play queue to appear. As a paying customer I ask for a fix to these. Will re-rate 5 stars again once these issues are fixed.",0
Disgusting update. Too many advertising,0
I use this for my releases And spotify is great. Im just worried what will happen with the platform when something new takes the spot.,0
I did love using Spotify! Not anymore since I'm ANNOYED that ALL of my playlists are gone for some reason...,0
"I cant play the songs i want but instead, its playing other songs. It was ok before but now i cannot play sons i want",0
good apps,1
Excellent quality and choices.,1
"It's constantly logging you out and when you need an email confirmation it doesn't work, and way to many ads",0
What's up with all the bugs? Music stops because of in app notifications. Most of the time the lock screen controls don't appear. Frustrating,0
"No easy access to private mode on Android, have to go through setting every single time.",0
"It's cool, the lyrics could be better but overall amazing experience",1
Great service. I've found so many 8 bands by using the 'other songs like this' options.,1
I love it but I need to find certain songs and sometimes they are not on there,0
"Hey Spotify, just for the record, Joe Rogan is the reason I finally decided to download Spotify and am about to grab a premium membership. There was an episode short on YouTube that I really wanted to see so I came to Spotify and am pretty impressed. I love Spotify so far but Rogan is the reason why I came and am about to give yall my money lol. Stand behind Joe. He's the truth. 100%",1
I can't use it. I have no intention on my fingers si when you turn off my phone I can't vopen it up again. I hate it terribly,0
"Excellent ,quality sound ,options are in abundance, the premium option is a must make up your own playlists etc etc top marks.",1
"It's a good app but the only downside is it won't play the songs you want to listen to. Fir example if you try cklicking on a song, it won't play it, it will play a radio bassed around that song.",0
If i wanted to listen to music online id go to youtube useless app unless youre willing to pay,0
"The app has become super glitchy on my phone. The song is playing but the play bar is nowhere to be seen. You click on the heart to ""like"" a song and nothing happens, the app doesn't react to my headphones controls... Constant freezes and shutdowns and forced to restart the app several times! What the heck is happening???",0
Installed this on my phone today. It won't allow me to login to my account! I am getting a head ache now from too many attempts to fix this. Really disappointed. Uninstalling the app from my phone and smart watch. Never had an experience like this from other music apps. Now it's saying i can't login due to too many attempts. I even changed my password. Thanks a lot for ruining my pre workout mood. I would have bought a premium version if there was one.,0
Spotify is a really good app cause you do not have to pay for the songs and that's why I like Spotify,1
All the songs are there in these app,0
Latest update removed artist list from my music. Makes Spotify practically unusable. I used to love Spotify but I'm going to another streaming service now.,0
"Until now it was running smoothly but don't what's happening now that it is no more working in mobile data even when there is proper connectivity, but running properly with wi fi connectivity. I have Uninstall and re-install it but same issue",0
I love I can listen to music without having my screen on,1
It was hard to just cancel on the app. After I used free 3 months.,0
"This is great but for some reason my Spotify just deleted itself and when I reinstall it, it just deleted itself again. My account still exists and I can use the chrome version but is very annoying",0
Crashes all the time. Having to keep on closing and opening.,0
"Easy to manage,awesome totally awesome!!!",1
Very nice app still need some improvement...but it's great all round,1
Amazing app for Music,1
"im using spotify premium and it's always a good experience. animations on the app are cute too â¤ï¸ this has been my necessity app haha whenever i get a new device, it needs to have spotify",1
Love the sound and my smooth jazz,1
"Too many advertisement for every single song. At the moment i really hate this app, otherwise i love the app",0
I love Spotify its just sometimes when I want to play a song It will bring um an album that's kind of anoying but I've all love the app,1
"Really , if you don't pay , and have to listen to adds , they start advertising in middle of a song , I really don't need this app!!!",0
This is an amazing app really i enjoy song very much and adds are coming I know but this is their profit in exchange we are listen our fav musics.,1
Great music but 2 stars it doesn't have my favorite song,0
This is a very good app. I listen music on Spotify. Thank You very much.,1
"Before I loved this app but after the recent update I can't do anything. If I try to do anything but look at the home page, I get the message to check my internet connection despite being connected. No other apps are having issues and I've tried everything all the way to a hard reset of the phone. Nothing works. So get it or don't. But be prepared to delete it just in case. Switching to another app myself",0
"I love using Spotify. I am a premium user so my experience might be different but when I didn't have premium I still really liked it. Although the adds do get a little annoying especially when your in a certain mood. I would recommend to get the premium it, for me someone who listen all the time it's definitely worth it.",1
"Solid app, great variety of usefulness. The app does shutdown frequently when the screen times out, ad pops up, or Bluetooth switch. Checked settings for a fix, nothing. Searched the net for a fix, nothing. Devs will probably suggest a monetary solution but...",1
Unable to close Spotify on Android 11 phone. I even logged off Spotify and it still shows on my notifications bar.,0
I pay for this service and it hasn't disappointed me yet.,1
Just leave the ads it's the best,1
"So , you want everyone to be a premium user . Ads after every w songs sometimes 1 song , i quit it",0
Went through a rough patch with spotify and their glitches after their recent update. Today I reached out to customer support who walked me through troubleshooting. Now working as it did before and better. Can listen to all my favorite songs with no issues.,0
Super good love it 110/12 play when u turn phone off had it since I was 5 good love it,1
"The app is great but sometimes I'm indecisive of what I want to listen to, I just want to listen to something. Can you maybe add a button like the one netflix has (surprise me) or something. That would be really great especially if it plays something related to the kind of music we listen to. Wonderful app nevertheless.",1
Don't let you play the songs you press,0
Best app I have ever seen to hear songs I have used many apps but it is the best app to hear songsâ¤ It has many albums to hear songs this app is awesome i loved itðŸ˜ðŸ˜â¤â¤,1
"Spotify is useful for so many things. Studying, vibing, you name it! I would give it more stars if possible!",0
"It was great until the app remained pitch black. then I updated it, still didn't work. Now that I'm trying to reinstall, it just stays on the installing stage. My premium account will go to waste if this won't be fixed.",0
it's super but i don't download music in this appðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”,0
I can't see my playlists on the app. It kept saying that i need to add music and podcasts. I tried creating new playlists but it didnt appear on my library. Is this a bug? Please fix this.,0
"Keeps saying no internet, when set to offline, when stuff I'm trying to play is downloaded stuff? Turn to online with my wi fi same gd thing? Worked great for years now this? Why do i pay for premium?",0
just because of the ads,0
V. Good quality of songs. Just some ads in between better than YouTube music tho.,1
"Used to love it! All of a sudden - after the last update I guess - my Spotify will not show up on my lock screen. No matter what setting I change, I've logged out, I've reinstalled, nothing works.. Other than that, I have no complaints but this really sucks",0
You gotta play ad after every songs and that too three ads all at once you need to understand that not everyone can use premium! Fix this thing please rest it's a nice app if it doesn't play ads after every songðŸ¥²,0
Never had any issues until now..constantly glitching. Music stops playing even with the app open. The play/pause buttons disappears. This has put a damper on my listening experience. Needs an update asap.,0
I don't know what they've done but the recent updates have ruined functionality. Edit: came back to give it a one star and looks like nothing has changed. Was constantly crashing yesterday while I was driving.,0
All the music and podcasts I want and after you pick some songs it finds amazing new songs for you to listen to,1
So i dont like that spotify adds its own songs into my playlistsso i really dislike that and i wish to be able to disable this feature,0
Fabulous love listening to all the oldies,1
even without premium the app works amazing,1
"I want to play a song and its playing similar songs like I asked for a playlistðŸ˜­. Not worth the hype, getting uninstalled from all my devices. Get apple music or YouTube music instead. Not worth the frustrationâ›·.",0
Very good! Redid my review because you can finally choose which song you want to listen to!,1
I can't even play the song I like it just chooses for me and I don't like that I can't even fast forward to where I want to start the song like I will want it in the middle but I can't ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜ I wanna choose for myself ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜ ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡,0
Spotify is better than other apps its doesn't stuck Which is pretty good but one thing you can bring is some more songs maybe cuz i didn't find much Chinese popular songs not only Chinese you may add some others too that is my suggestions,0
Ive veen using spotify for years now but i discovered yt music. Thanks spotify,1
"Spotify has everything, even my friends hard-core band from the 80s is in here! And they didn't cave to the Woke Mafia and kept Joe Rogan. Free Speech for everyone!",1
"""Premium"" user experience: -You can't block your followers and spotify is refusing to add this feature FOR 10 YEARS. -UI is horrible and it gets worse with EVERY update. Screens are bigger and bigger and it's hard to reach top of the screen with one hand. What spotify is doing? They move important things to the top of the screen. -Also you can't customize anything. -External equalizers don't work properly - Search bar randomly stops working",0
Great app especially for podcast listening. Lol lefties are big mad that Joe is having open conversations about what's going on. ðŸ¤£ ðŸ‘ðŸ½,1
"I love the design and the delivery. I just realised it compatible with my Google Mini Home, and booom, its fun ðŸ˜„ time.",1
"whenever i make a playlist, spotify just randomly adds songs and i can never restart my playlist and listen to the songs i actually want to listen to",0
The first time I downloades it is the first time I liked it. Beautiful collections of songs. May God blesa you. I recommend it.,1
"Please enable a switch for album art on the lock screen! It would be nice if we had the choice to turn it on or off, Google Music has this feature.",0
User friendly and convenient,1
"Every every song I look for is there....,. Still haven't found a song that isn't on there",0
"OK. I would like to be able to rewind the songs for about 5 seconds with a click, that would be very useful when trying to learn to play a song. Also i would like to be able to choose lower quality for streaming and download! But, besides from that, it's OK.",1
So far my experiences with spotify has been one of the best! I really enjoy the fact that you have many plan options. down side is that some songs are not available but it happens In a rare occasion,1
People often complain about too much ads but i am using it since a week and only got 3 ads overall it's a great app,0
Premium user here and can't use the app. It keeps on crashing the plsy/pause bar dissappears I can't play podcasts for longer than 5 minutes. I can't move around my playlists. This has been going on for weeks now. I want my money back.,0
I don't like how it can turn on by itself when I try to listen to video on my car and it will start running not a good thing needs to be delt with soon,0
Better,1
I am not able to listen any song very bad ðŸ‘Ž,0
im a premium user but these days the app stoped in the middle of playing music And then the played song bar disappear. The widget on home screen or menu bar also disappear. i need to restart my phone first to make it work again. Please fix this. it happens on both my android phones.,0
What a non sense app. More ads less songs. After every 2nd song they just show advertisment. Not a few seconds ad more than minute ad that is. Seriously Irritating app.,0
I will be deleting this app and downloading pandora. Spotify plays the same song about every 2 hours today It has been about every hour. Makes for a great day at work so dont waste your time with this junk app. I've given them the benefit of the doubt for too long and nothing changes.,0
Allow us to song search within an enhanced Playlist. Also let us stay in landscape while navigating on a tablet,1
Needs an update keeps pausing abruptly other that great 5 star,1
"When using Android auto the music will randomly just stop playing, sometimes it'll start back up again but other times it looks like it's playing because the time on the song keeps moving up, but no sound will come out and the only way to fix it is to unplug and replug",0
"Every song I click on to play, it plays something entirely different. Why create a music streaming device that doesn't work? I miss the days of iTunes and iPods ðŸ˜­",1
"Used to be great, since last update keeps glitching, the play bar keeps disappearing and the only way I can get it back is to uninstall/reinstall the app until it happens again. Also occasionally stops playing music for no reason. Otherwise I've loved it.",0
Last month several playlist were deleted. I had to list them all again. Brush it off coz it's probably a one time bug. But today all of my downloaded playlist were removed from my download list and I have to re download every single one of it. What is going on with your app?,0
cannot get this app to play music on my tablet annoying but it plays on my phone purfectly well,1
I like the app but I don't get why you have to pay to skip songs it makes no sense.,0
Can you add this feature fore Spotify we can listen it on background if we listen doring playing that's more enjoy full,1
"music quality is good, but on mobile there are just too many ads to the point where it forces you to buy premium. i remember before there was only like 1 ad every 2-3 songs, but ive had instances where ive gotten 15 ads in a row after one song and then another 15 right after its not even funny. this also happens before playing any song on mobile.",0
I haven't had any problems with this app. I have been using it for a long time. I would just like to suggest that there should be an option to select a few songs at once to add to a playlist. Sometimes it is a bit frustrating to choose songs individually.,0
Worst appni ever used.having 2gb of mobile data but still can't acess any song,0
I don't know why we can rewind and fast forward the song and adverts are interupting my entertainment aside from those I love the app and it the best song streaming app,1
Ads+shuffle only at least for my experience with using this on the phone,0
"The application is 50 to 50, I use it only because of the lack of normal competitors, the application constantly allows myself not to display the bottom part with music control, music disappears from the playlist, pre-loaded is often deleted and these are the most frequent, the list is large",0
Why did they remove touch preview? It makes no sense its gone..,0
Just amazing .prefect for every occasion,1
Amazing! Almost every day at every hour I listen to music and Spotify gives me a lot of opportunities to keep listening my favorite jams and podcast.,1
how can you not give the most legit music streaming app 5 stars?,0
Why spotify always glitches this so uncomfortable,0
"By far the worst app on my phone. Freezing, ending and skipping songs and podcasts mid way through. Controls not working altogether, unable to stop media unless force closing all apps.",0
"Use to love using Spotify till the newest update. Now controls don't show up so I can't pause, stop, or have any access to any controls AT ALL. Also music just stops whenever it feels like it. Podcasts also. I keep having to restart my podcasts because they just...pause. PLEASE FIX!",0
Easy and good quality,1
"""Music to my ears"" Awesome!! Soooo Cool! ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ‘ðŸ‘",1
they fixed the genre issue but now the app crashes and the play bar completely dissappears when I open the app each time even if I'm listening to music and I cant play a song until i close it all the way and open it again. Also please make it stop asking me if i want to allow Bluetooth PLEASE,0
"Used to LOVE the app, but now crashes on every device i own except my pc. Looks like they are just trying to do too much with it. 3 versions now all crash, like others stated, while using both pixel and samsung devices.",0
"Playback bar disappears regularly when playing from ""liked songs"".",0
Comprehensive content & professional delivery.,1
Everytime I use Spotify my music always change into something that it's not on my list of music not sure why but they gotta fix this bug cause I been paying monthly just to keep my music,0
best music streaming app,1
Spotify is very entertaining and helps you relax,1
"Using this app for years but for the past 2-3 months is been glitching & freezing a lot. I'll be listening to music & suddenly it stops for no reason, i open my phone & the app is closed. Also when i connect to bluetooth it used to start playing music right away but doesnt do this now, i go to open the app & it plays music for a second then turns it off like i was never playing music. So many bugs, fix them.",0
"Great music selection! Easy, reliable with no glitches.",1
Has been good for a long time recently it has become very problematic. If I had reviewed it a week ago 5 stars today 2 stars,0
My personal Playlist will just randomly stop when it wants.,0
Best music app!,1
Podcasts keep stopping whilst listening,0
Spotify is amazing. You can hear all kinds of music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ It's perfect,1
The app is great to use and very easy to find things but ist annoying when trying to make playlists and the title of the song is the artist for all songs,0
Relevant and functional,1
"I love the app, im a long time user of Spofity, but my songs dont want to play even if i have internet and I want to know what the hell is going on",0
"I am a loyal customer and have been for years! I love the app special the different varieties of music,Playlist and podcasts. This is great!!",1
Keeps crashing or doesn't display any of the tabs to pause/play etc when music is playing.,0
"Absolutely rubbish, the fact that you can't select the song you want from your playlist without having to pay for premium is just a joke. I don't mind the ads, fair enough but I'm jus annoyed that I have to listen to an ad just to listen to a bunch of songs I don't like in the first place",0
Hands down a great app with nearly every artist at your fingertips,1
The app lost all my playlists last week and no matter how many times I reinstall it and the SD card it will not work. I am travelling this week and it looks like without my music. Why do developers try to improve apps but just break them instead. Pissed off.,0
Good put I wish they could have it so I can look and play each one I want on my play list,1
"Music stops and i have updated the app,uninstalled, reinstalled and it does the same damn thing fix it please",0
It was good until it started giving me samples of songs in my Playlist and are now unplayable. trash app after the update,0
"For some reason when I'm listening with headphones in it keeps on pausing which is really annoying, Spotify could you please fix this issue!",0
It just stopped working,0
"**Fix for not working on WiFi. In your phone settings, go to Apps, find Spotify, and under Network and WiFi ensure that Unrestricted background usage is toggled On. Immediately fixed the issues I'd had for weeks, no idea why it must have toggled Off automatically.",0
Love it accept commercials,1
it's a good app but I really hate that I can't pick what songs to play as a free listener and there's too many repetitive ads,0
Doesn't work with my Andriod Auto properly.,0
A really good and affordable platform to stream musicðŸ‘Œ,1
I used the free Spotify for years and have found it easy to navigate and loved it which is impressive since Im not great with technology The only complaints I had were I couldnt skip more then 2 songs on my lists and after 2-3 songs 2 min of the same adds would interrupt whichs annoying but manageable My kid bought me a subscription as a Xmas present and I must say as a frugal person its well worth paying for the subscription I recommend bucking up the  its great,1
So much better going to Spotify via Duck Duck Go than the Don't Be Evilâ„¢ We're Just Playing!StoreÂ©,0
"I love it! Although I would like to be able to play individual songs, instead of only playlists, while I'm on the App on my phone.",1
"Podcast, music, Playlist, suggestions, ease of use... All great!",1
App crashes intermittently after the last update.,0
"Just got hosed with 6 or 7 ads, then they played one song from the playlist I selected before changing the artist and playing 3 more ads. All in less than 10 minutes. Worse than cable tv. I'm glad I left that behind, excited to leave Spotify behind too.",0
This app could REALLY do better by 1: not ONLY being able to skip 6 TIMES 2: making it SIMPLER to find the SONG you WANT to listen to instead of having to just get LUCKY And not to mention 3: the fact you basically HAVE TO PAY to USE the APP,0
Would rate 5 stars if the apps gets fixed so music doesn't just randomly stop playing mid-song. Lowering my rating due to constant volume changes mid-track,0
Really annoying. Everytime I open my phone after it being closed Spotify starts playing automatically on speaker. I've tried everything to get it to stop.,0
Too many ads and can't pick a song always dhaffles.,0
Please optimize the app for galaxy Z fold 3. It drains so much battery. Many people have tried everything to counter this battery drain but no hope.,0
It makes me living more then listening,1
"I'm a student of computer science and a long-term user of spotify, as well as many other streaming services. It's downright criminal that a company that rakes in so much cash has such low quality software. For the last FEW WEEKS I haven't even been able to use the app. Song that I have ""downloaded"" don't even play. They should feel ashamed but instead people keep giving them money. I could list problems for an hour. If I could post an essay on it I would.",0
It's a pretty good app. It makes me feel like a superhuman with will even of what I'm doing. But it has a little ads that appears but it's a nice app. Thanks for making it free to use.,1
"Hi, I updated my app to the lastest version but I still have problems on lyric sharing. Can't seem to find the button on it even after restarting my phone or clearing the data of the app itself. It would be great if you could help me on this one. Thank you!",0
"The app is not stable and app plays hardly once in a day with 100 add. And the app is not able to connect through internet, i reinstated it and now am not able to login. Use brain to fix those bugs rather than thinking of new adds.",0
"I can find every music, podcast and documentary and the app is very easy to use",1
Every update the app gets slower and lags more,0
"This is fr a good app but I hate the update,you can escape those like ads(not rlly a reason) Also I hate the fact that I have to wait 6 per hour to just skip the song like dude let me skip or I'm gonna lose patient,tbh I don't agree with this update the much.and if it is a bug then fix this pls.",0
Great setup...easy to use and share music,1
The most paid person on Spotify is openly racist and Spotify support them by keeping their podcast up on their platform,0
Loved the app. Probably the best music provider out there. Reduced to 3 too many ads. Way too many.,0
"This will always be my favorite platform to listen to music on. I don't like to subscribe to alot of things, but this one is a must have.",1
App works really bad on my Samsung Galaxy. Once the screen is blocked the songs keep getting paused. I have to close the app and launch it again at least 2 or 3 times per day. Some podcast are automatically ticked as played although I haven't finished listening to them. Tried deleting and downloading the app and it didn't work. Never experienced these issues with Apple Music or even with the Spotify iOS version. I am seriously considering going back to apple music.,0
Good apps i wanna give 5 star but using this app longer and longer the ads come every 2 song after and says 30 min uninterrupted ads but when we play 3 song or more ads come again. Some song are unable to play. Last point when entering playlist it took time but when we turn off our net and enter the playlist it's fast... Wts does it mean?? Plzz fixed it,0
"The app has been fairly buggy the last few months, got worse with the last update. Enjoy the app and the music selection but my look to switch if things keep on this track.",0
"Love this app! You can find almost 99% of all music there is here. The app is amazing to use, very user friendly and id recommend it to anyone. The spotify team are pros! Definitely worth a try, if you like music, you like spotify",1
"The app was really good until the latest update (06/23/22) , the layout is now confusing and everytime i switch to another tab the music is either choppy or cuts out. You need to pay for a bunch of things now which are very unnecessary. As a person that really enjoyed using spotify before this update i'd rather use youtube for my music, it seems like your getting a bunch of complaints from this update. I'd remove it before you loose spotify listeners too because im not paying for my music.",0
"I'm a premium user and have been listening to music on Spotify for years! I would rate 5 stars, but recently, the ""currently playing"" bar randomly disappears and makes controlling music very challenging. (I'm on a Samsung S21 Ultra).",1
You need premium to tern of shuffle but on xbox and laptops you dont,0
The only thing that annoys me are that amount of ads you guys put on the app.,0
"From today the app became unusable. I'm on version 8.7.0.1147 It asked me to allow for background activity which was always granted and from then it randomly stops playing, popup being responsive and requires app restart. It seems the cycle takes 5-10min. I might change rating to 3 stars max. I'm a long term premium user and there was almost no change in user interface for years despite so many complaints about queue handling, playlist management, recommendation quality etc. So -2 for arrogance",0
My walks and bus rides are more fun with Spotify Thank you Spotify,1
Everything is okay and fine. But if i want to play the song that i choose can it just play it? No need with the shuffle or the preview thing.,1
"This is no longer a music platform, it is a misinformation and hate platform",0
how to make basic fried rice 3 cups cooked rice * 2 Tbs sesame oil. 1 small white onion chopped. 1 cup frozen peas and carrots thawed. 2-3 Tablespoons soy sauce more or less to taste. 2 eggs lightly beaten. 2 Tbsp chopped green onions optional.,0
Found everything i wanted in this app I'm going premium very affordable,1
What the f - why can't I skip songs? Or pause them? Or see what is playing?? And why does my Spotify app shut itself down after 3/4 songs now?! WHHHAAAATTTTTTTTTT THHEEE FFFFFFFFFF,0
"Best Music app by far, suggestions when picking your tunes are spot, found music I forgot existed.......download it......free version just as good as Premium ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¤™ðŸ¼",1
The control panel has been missing since yesterday. Reappears when you restart the phone and then goes missing after a little while. Can't locate what is playing or connect to speaker.,0
Play bar/controls keep disappearing and I keep having to force stop the app to get it back. Tried reinstalling but the problem is still there,0
"It use to be good until Podcasts were forced feed by Spotify with no way of removing them from home tab. App is more and more cluttered rendering a simple music experience into a nightmare of navigation. Getting more and more notifications within the app that are bugged and not wanted but you can't get rid of them, only click to postpone annoyance with ""maybe later"". Music suffling does not work, you end up in a loop with the same 35songs despite having +2000songs in your library. A premium user",0
It sucks now with a new update and you can't even play songs in order anymore.. UNINSTALLING this app as soon as I copy all my songs to SoundCloud,0
"Only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of the most recent bugs (PLEASE PATCH!!!) I pay for premium + hulu, and although I love every single second of the service, the recent bugs are almost impassable. I close the app, the music keeps playing. I go to reopen the app to find that music is playing, but I can't view the song I'm listening to. So again, I have to restart the app. This happens every time I use different devices. I sell Spotify Premium for y'all. I've been using it for over 10 years",0
A life time of musical experience. Really enjoying the app,1
Skips out multiple times a song at this point. So incredibly frustrating.,0
"Was good until I started having some issues, the app doesn't play music, I have a connection too. Also songs randomly freeze for a few seconds and play they also don't appear as playing. Please resolve this issue thanks a lot.",1
This is good but I need help!! I have a Samsung a22 and I have tried updating and everything else but I cannot see the lyrics! Could someone help!???,0
"Ads every 2 songs. No joke. Originally Spotify would only play ads every 30mins. I then paid consistently for spotify premium for a few years. The penalty if you are not able to renew the subscription right away, is 2 ads after every 2 songs. Equates to about 8 ads per 30mins.",0
I have been a client since 2015. The Spotify application offers you so much for being a Premium customer. It just seems to have so much listening pleasures that it's hard to believe it's only 9.99 a month.,1
"Well, Spotify is great as always, but the Android app has a few rough edges around Chrome Cast: 1. Disconnecting wireless headphones while casting breaks the cast, the app switchws to on device playback through the phone's speakers 2. Connecting wireless headphones while casting makes the app switch to on-device playback, I don't know why",0
This is a very good app to listen to music. It is the most easier app to play music on.,1
Not working properly,0
"I got logged out of my Spotify account and I kept logging in but it said ""Something went wrong"" can you resolve this problem?",0
"First time user on spotify, created my account and less than 2 weeks later my account was hacked (first time in 7+ years) and I only found out when it said my payment method wasn't working (weird!) So I updated my payment and it was renewed. Come to find out that he switched it from Duo Premium to regular premium. I told them this wouldn't work as I convinced my gf to get rid of YT for it, Spotify refused to update (I even offered to pay difference) Spotify is heart set on losing new customers!!",0
It is an amazing app i love enjoying my favorite songs and listening to playlists while doing my chores(and whwnever i am bored)thank youâ¤â¤,1
Spotify was my first music app way back when it was first introduced and I think it's the best music app today.,1
"Just why? When I click on a playlist it just plays random songs that aren't even related to the artist. This hasn't happened to me in all of the years of using spotify, until now. You can't even preview songs in a playlist anymore you can only see the names. They have also for some reason removed the go back to last song played button, you can now only skip or pause, and even worse the button is STILL THERE meaning that they just won't let me use it. Just what the heck happened Spotify?",0
Wonderful app for music loversâ™¥ï¸,1
Recently the app has been buggy. It lags and sometimes doesn't show media controls.,0
I would rate 5 but it really bothers me that I have 1554 liked songs and when I set it to shuffle it plays the same songs over and over... why??? Other than that I really love the app and do listen to it all day everyday. It's just super irritating to skip songs that play all the time.,0
I am a new client to your platform and hoping to every minute of it. My stage name is HERKLEDEES a Jamaican singer. I am glad to be on your team.,1
Never a problem works well and has the features I want Thanks Spotify,1
A very good app for music but the adds are terrible after every 1 and 2 songs there are three adds which is very irritating the adds can't be skipped and few adds insult the users which is super weird like saying that we are not true fans etc... and some adds which promote the movies have 18+ content which is not okay as many users are below 18 and some might be below 13 too so that's why I think you should consider checking the trailer or preview or whatever it is before uploading it as an add,0
Doesn't work on wifi ðŸ˜© and even not properly on mobile data always lags while listening music such a disgusting appðŸ¤®,0
This is an amazing app this has no at all ads and it's just an amazing app that nobody can compare to and it is amazing how when you turn off your phone you can still listen to your music,1
":) would be cool if everyone gets the premium package so everyone can use the account instead of just for 1 person, and with the discount price of a student. Music is life.",0
This is the best app for music ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‰,1
Great music app. God bless you all. Christ Jesus loves you.,1
Good,1
It could use some work with the recommendations but overall it's a cool app. ðŸ˜Ž,1
Why do you add songs to my Playlist and I put them out but more come in please fix that if you could please do thank you,0
Better than soundcloud i love this app sound cloud us justðŸ—‘ï¸.I was wrong spotify sucks it so greedy,0
"It's really good â˜ºï¸ ,but i just wish we could download music instead of listening ðŸŽ§",0
"It's good app for music lover ,specialty who use music when they work",1
Excellent app. Live Spotify!!,1
This app is awesome really recommend it from other people really good music app ðŸ˜Ž,1
"If you start canceling people I will cancel this app, believe that. Don't follow the stupids or you will loose the money you love the most. MERICA!!",0
It's the best way to discover new tunes.,1
"Artist pages and song art don't load properly since the UI change, please fix this issue as this was never present in previous versions, thank you",0
Well this sucks now want to listen to music? Well u will get one chance to listen to it for free and screen off no ads after that u cant play it again just boom other song just plays also when u notice u just skipped the song u want to listen they wont let u becuz the rewind button is ded always,0
It was terrible and not a pleaseant experinece. The music sucns and couldnt find the crazy frog remix of all time............,0
"For about over a week the app has been behaving strangely. It will play music without even showing whats playing, and at times what is playing will randomly pause or skip ahead. The only way to fix these issues is to restart the app and hope it doesnt happen again. Currently im closing and reopening multiple times in one sitting using the app. Hope this is just a software problem to be solved.",0
Worst..In whole day ads are more played than songs.. better download ganna or wynk or else Spotify will continuosly BEG you to buy premium.,0
"Love this app, however there is a bug where the player is not showing and its becoming really annoying.",0
"We love Spotify , it is wonderful",1
Love this app. I love controlling my TV. It's just frustrating sometimes to edit Playlist from the phone.,0
Used to be good. Now the controls don't show 90% of the time so you can't change/play/like the song. The player pauses on its own so often. They say to turn off background apps and stuff but that made no difference. Not resubscribing until they fix it,0
Ok Nighttime,1
This app is amazing â¤ï¸ i just love Spotify â¤ï¸,1
This is just an amazing platform that gives you variety and Platform Church (Rested Life) content everything is in it and our members love it.,1
"Great app but its not accepting my card for payment anymore, My card is working fine with other apps tho ......",1
There are too much ads. I know there is premium for ad less experience but still too much ad.,0
Bluetooth is wonky with certain car radios.,1
I can't pause or click next on my basic Spotify plan ðŸ˜­ Please fix!,0
"Since latest update, songs in any playlist/queues will not auto play. Song selected plays, then when sing ends, nothing. Also green colored indication which song is playing, though the song is playing. I've cleared the cache, uninstalled/re-installed app. Fix your bugs or I'm canceling my premium subscription!!",0
"I usually play the ""Daily Drive"" playlist, which contains music numbers and news plus other podcasts. I hate football and it still plays ""FC Afkicken"" podast. Why isn't there a button to dislike/block stupid podcasts like unliked sports!?",0
"The App was working properly, until one day I wanted to Log In, a message appeared saying ""you can only use Spotify for 14 days abroad"" that really sucks",0
Awful experience. Spotify should stick to if it ain't broken don't fix it. Music controls don't work well. Music image doesn't come up most times. Now playing dissappears. Also try to include numbering in albums,0
"I don't like the ads except that I love the app and pls add day mode in Spotify.Also, remove some dirty playlist from your app there are too many pages like that it's a song platform not the platform for sexual songs.",0
Stuck on loading screen,0
It is a very good and practical application. The only negative and important point is the sound quality and I hope the flac quality will be added as soon as possible.I have a suggestion for spotify.It would be great if you add scoring section.You can rate albums and musics.You can turn spotify to music imdb.Spotify will be perfect.,1
Very nice app for music lover,1
Incredible perfect for music lovers. Sadly you cant pick specific songs on your playlists on phone with the free version other thatn that great app totally recomend!,1
Been on Spotify for years and years never had an issue and has every song you'll ever want,1
"Great variety of content, interesting and educational podcasts, lots of my favourite artists all in one place. I love my playlists and the ease of creating new ones. Thank you!!",1
"Streaming quality in the free version is bad, hope they make it as it was couple of weeks ago",0
I like this but whenever i play ofline games it just stops ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜• (Please fix spotify),0
I love all the music with no advertisements,1
"After pausing music through my various Bluetooth headphones for 10 minutes, you are not able to restart the music from the headphones. You have to restart it from the phone screen.",0
"This app was honestly great but there are to many adds. The adds last for so long and it can be really annoying when I put on music while I sleep. It's also quite sad how I can't even click to listen to my song from the liked list. It just gives me like a 10 second trailer of the song. In order to actually listen to it, you have to search it up.. so in order to actually enjoy your music, you pay for premium.",0
So easy to use and it is awsome app.,0
New update is trash. Currently playing song bar at the bottom of the screen regularly disappears and I can't control my music. Connection to Bluetooth speaker now cuts in and out. Wish I could revert to previous version.,0
I hate it it has ads.,0
"Hello Spotify! Thank you, thank you, thank you, for standing up to those who demand the cancelation of anyone! You must be a patriot!",1
"Kind of annoying changes over the last couple of updates (rearranging playlists and sorting mechanisms, Auto-adding podcasts to playlists etc). if there was a good alternative I'd have considered switching already. update 04/22: sometimes longer load times and regularly redownloading offline songs which is terribly annoying if you are just about to leave your wlan and see it has to redownload 200 songs for some reason. also interruption/sound cutout problems on spotify connect with alexa",0
"Guys please fix these bugs ðŸ˜« No music controls, music keeps pausing, music doesn't stop when you exit the app. Hellppp",0
I've had Spotify for about 2 to 3 weeks and it's seems great and is better than I thought it was going to be.,1
Amazing! Never fails and has all my favorite songs.,1
Great music app professional ðŸ‘Œ,1
"Excellent all around. Highly recommended for all, especially for music lovers & musicians. The lyric feature is fantastic. Top app! Well worth the download & subscription. Very happy with the experience so far. - Peace & love",1
"A lot of cool features. But oh, how I hate their podcast feature. Their experience is overall bad. Way worse than Pocket Casts, and I can't listen to podcasts how I want to (especially quickly making and editing lists). But they keep pushing it ( you can't turn it off) in a way that podcasts take away from the core experience of listening and discovering music.",0
"Easy and fun, large amount of content, go Spotify!",1
Nice,1
"I really like Spotify...when it works. Once every 2-3 months they update the app and a glitch appears. Usually it's something like the progress bar doesn't appear and I have to restart the app to get it to pop up which is small but extremely annoying when I have to do it at least once per 30 min. I pay for premium just for Spotify to do nothing about these issues when they appear and just leave the app buggy for a month. Everything else about the app is great, it's just the stupid bugs that suck",0
Crashes often after the latest update.,0
"Great but they need to make it easier to find an artist's songs, not just the top 6 most popular",0
"I have premium but it just randomly pauses when the screen goes off, please fix this app. I'm on a Samsung A52S",0
It's the best music app to listen to your favorites songs,1
"Liked it, but since you didn't back down to cancel culture & Neil, I love it. I believe I'll order the premium package. ðŸ˜",1
"I do love this app and always have. But I have some issues that I can't overcome no matter what I do. My favorite band does not play on my Spotify account. No matter what I log into, I still can't play songs by my favorite band that are even downloaded. I can only get it to play after long spouts of zero signal. And still it might not work. Why do adds still play over podcast when I pay for premium? I pay to not have any ads.",0
Since the update I'm having trouble starting up the app. I have to go into settings 4 to 5 times to clear cache but even then when I do get in it still takes awhile for playlists to load and for the play button to work,0
Best streaming service ever!,1
Love the scope and range of music available and synced lyrics are additional features that make the listening experience all the more enjoyable.,1
"It's good that you can use it for free and listen to playlists, also podcasts that you're into. The two issues I have are that sometimes (most times), I can't listen to the podcasts I've downloaded offline. Then the other is that you can't start a playlist from the beginning, a lot of the time you have to continue the playlist. I used to start another playlist then back again to start it from top but that has not worked in a while.",0
Very useful in a quite time,1
Doesn't support lyrics even though it's already updated,0
"When I would search for an artist in a playlist and hit shuffle play, it would shuffle play the songs from that artist only. Now it just shuffle plays from the whole playlist. Fix this please coz this is a hugh thing for me",1
After the latest update my songs just stop playing for no reason......please fix this,0
"logs out off your account for no reason sometimes, lost my account once. ad plays after every song and not thirty minutes unless you have premium. but a great music listening app regardless.",1
"Hey Spotify, reply my feedback i know you see my feedback. Why my Spotify stop when i play fb video. It is very irritating bhai, whenever i play a fb video while playing Spotify, Spotify Stop it's song, and i need to open the app again and again.",0
What have you done to this app? I can't see what I am playing anymore and I have lost all controls from my car to change songs. Please change back.,0
I have had a great experience â˜ºï¸ love it. Has all my music I love. Thank you Spotify ðŸ˜Š,1
"After the latest Samsung update the ""playing now"" notification in the notifications bar and lock screen no longer appear. Little inconvenient to have to open up the app every time you want to change a song. Daily mixes are good but extremely repetitive.",0
Best collection of songs in multilanguages,1
"Too many ads! After every song, atleast 1 AD would be there telling you to buy spotify premium membership",0
came from youtube music which has been bugging me for a while now. spotify is so much better.,0
Love the music you can all the song you want list new and oldest,1
"UI is a mess at the moment, does not show which song is playing and gets stuck on a song. Pretty frustrating.",0
App keeps pausing. Frustrating paying for premium and having the constant glitch. I loved this app. It makes me want to go back to an iPod.,0
"The app worked great. I'm premium because Amazon broke theirs. But I only want a music player with a recents list and a search bar. Don't care about the social aspect, or ANY of the music suggestions. And especially not podcasts. For me it's just bloated and taking up space. The website works just like the app, as far as searching and playing music is concerned. For zero extra memory space. So yeah, app got deleted. Feature request. Make a *Lite* version, that just plays music.",0
You are good but i think you need to improve on downloading system,0
Cancelling my subscription. Going back to peace and quiet.,0
"Your latest update really sucks.. the app run so slow and it hangs.. been a premium user for a year. The more you update, the more the app gets laggy. Changing soon to a better app.",0
"Good quality. But I don't like adverts. People trying to sell me stuff I don't need or want, wants me to turn off!",1
Continues to crash. Cant go more than a few minutes before my music stops. Upsetting. Thanks for continuing to fix the problems with this app. Otherwise love it!!!,0
Wasn't able to reply songs several times,0
Have to uninstall after every jre episode because it won't play more than 2 minutes without stopping. Can't play video on any device other than my smart phone. Get with the times spotify.,0
This app is really good I really like this app This is really easy to find any song of blackpink and BTS I really like this appðŸ‘,1
"Offline mode takes a while to respond, an issue that has plagued 3 of my phones (2x Samsung, 1x oppo many android update, app updates and years later still.",0
"The shuffle button is NOT working, Spotify will play the same song more then 3 times in one day.",0
When on playlists random songs will start playing even if I turn off auto play and turn off the ability for Spotify to add recommended song. Like I made a playlist with my songs to listen to not to get other random ones,0
I can find all of my favorite songs. If we don't know the lyrics then if you type a sentence of a song it finds the song for us. Nice music quality . It is a very good music app.,1
When I connected Bluetooth Spotify is closes automatically,0
App is good but you should provide with lyrics for the new songs and why the hell this app shows no internet connection even though when I'm connected with the internet.my internet work's fine but not this app..,0
Roberto firmino Dancel ,1
LOVE THE PERSONALIZATION OF THE PLAYLISTS,1
"When start app, usually blank page. When searching something, sometimes ""no internet connection available""....",0
Feel the song,1
Said listen to this ad for 30 minutes of unintruoted music no ads that's a lie 2 songs later ad mother couple songs later ad,0
Great app,1
Music pauses over and over without me doing it. It does it at random times and the enhance mode is also very bad. I delete a song off the enhanced playlist but it comes right back on while I'm listening to music.,0
I enjoy this Spotify love music and the podcasts they have,1
"Great app, and the family plan is awesome!!!",1
"I hate the new update so much. The songs that I want to play always get shuffled and every time I want to play a song I can't play it, there is a lot of ads are coming, I can't even skip the song. I have a good connection so far and I doesn't have any problems until I get the new version of sportify. This is so annoying",0
"Thank you Spotify for listening to my comment. I love the new update and am happy to re-subscribe! Thank you Thank you thank you!!!! ""I think a great feature for this app would be the ability to listen to my saved music by genera. """,1
There is a 30 second advertisement after each song and it is very irritating.,0
"This app is bloody impossible to use. Constantly glitching. I'd been debating deleting it for ages. And then they chose to align themselves with some idiot with a podcast over the legendary Neil Young, so that sealed the deal for me. See you in hell, Spotify.",0
Who decided to delete the preview option? Like we need that to know whether the reccommended songs are fit to our playlist before we decided to put it there. Just please give our songs preview back thanks.,0
It I is very good nice quality use this app and your mind will be free from any bad things,1
"The app is good, but recently, when I wanted to unsubscribe from the premium plan, I was faced with one problem. When I push ""cancel premium"" I see that message: ""Application error: a client-side exception has occurred"" idk how to fix this, there's no such topics on the forum...",0
"Please fix bugs, my Spotify app doesn't work right anymore. On any platform. Roku/phone/fire tv/ tablet",0
Its not good i pressed the heat waves and the song came out as hot road,0
Spotify removed the widget?! This app hard to navigate and use.. similar songs are suppose to play after my selection but never do. Honestly Ilike my free pandora with commercials over my spotify premium subscription right now.,0
"Best streaming library, worst UI. Been hopping the last year or so between all the big services and I've landed back here. I'm still disgusted at this interface. Nothing about this is intuitive. I miss the old ui. The AI sucks. If it weren't for the fact that Spotify has wormed its way into integrating with EVERYTHING, I would not use it. Wish I could turn podcasts off.",0
"Spotify hates external storages. All my songs gets deleted from micro sd, a long time bug and yet they can't fix it yet.",0
I love this app but i hate how i keep getting ads after every single song it is INCREDIBLY ANNOYINGâ˜ â˜ ,0
Love Spotify's selection of music and Podcasts. I'm always discovering new artists. 5 star rating.,1
most recent versions are broken. the player bar at the bottom of the screen does not appear. i constantly have to restart the app.,0
"Had a few bugs such as liked songs diasapearing from months ago, but appart from that Spotify premium has always offered fair pricing and is essential for the music fanatic :)",1
fix bugs!!!! Spotify makes billions and has the worst bugs with recent update,0
"Why is this app so broken? It used to be so good, now I constantly get badgered to turn on Bluetooth, the playback bar doesn't always show and I have to close and re-open to fix, and its also a massive battery drain. There is a lot of good in this app but its currently overshadowed by how buggy it is.",0
"it used to be that you could press shuffle unlimited amount of times, but now for some reason it won't reshuffle with a recent update, and i want the old ver back",0
Spotify is an amazing app to download. It provides great service and it has all of the music you can think of. There is next to none adds. It's a wonderful app and I recommend it to everyone.,1
It's good but uses more data than I expected at first and some albums are not excluded.,1
I miss when they used to let you play the song before adding it to a playlist :\,0
Happy so far!! Good tunes!,1
This app is absolutely the best I can make however much Playlists I want and it had a bunch of features but the only thing All the freaking ads like omg spotify please stop making the ads so longgggg and we literally have to hear the same ad over and over and over again like geezh,0
Great variety of music and Podcast.,1
Spotify keeps stopping despite carrying out all the suggestions on the spotify website to prevent this. Will scrap my premium membership if this continues.,0
Average. It bugs out so often it's hard to use and makes me not want to use it at all.,0
It's quite annoying that I can't control my music. It's happening more frequently that I can't see the play controls. I have to force close the app to stop the music. Unsure but might be related to my phone recently upgrading.,0
It's very nice application ðŸ˜Š I enjoy songs with lyrics â˜ºï¸ðŸ’œ,1
"The app is great! I get recommendations of new songs from favorite artists, and can easily create Playlists of favorites! The app works fine on my 2021 Samsung phone...no issues",1
"The app has been devolving with every update. This past update, Spotify removed the function where you could preview songs on a list of recommendations to add to your playlists. For what reason? No one knows. It's so frustrating that Spotify is intentionally making the app LESS user friendly.",0
"im suppose to be premium until july but it always show that i have payment issues for the premium, please fix it, thankyou",0
This app is good but there is one issue in this app that is you can not while listening music or song I cant skip the music in the middle I have to listen full music Every thing is good in this app ,1
Cannot fault Spotify. ðŸ’š,1
Good quality not to many interruption,1
It's alright I do have issues When looking for music Some you don't have when I try look for them,1
Wow.. it looks fantastic just enjoying my best songs on this App. Spotify indeed is the best music app.,1
This is a good website to listen to music.,1
When my podcast ends it keeps connecting to other people in the house and playing their music,0
Not good But not bad,1
The first Playlist picked for me contained artists I don't know & not clicked on as favorites....,0
"I really like the app, I would give Spotify a 5 star rating if there weren't so many adds and premium features, on my Xbox it lets me choose what songs I want to listen to and have infinite skips. But when I'm on my phone I have to shuffle play random songs, I also don't like how Spotify adds songs to my playlist, I keep hiding them but there are more getting added every day, I would appreciate it if you guys would just have a recommendation list under the songs, but don't play them.",0
I like spotify BUT it has waaaay to many ads interrumping...it says 30 min without ads. Not true!!!! Its so so annoying i hear more ads than music....Deleting the App,0
"Good but why aren't there any podcasts on the Pakistani version? Anyhow, the overall experience is goodðŸ‘",1
Best app for music!â¤ï¸,1
"So many glitches the past month that it's just ruining listening to music for me. Paying for premium when half the time there's no play button, it doesn't show me what song I'm listening to even while on the app, won't let me skip songs because of this or click pause or carry on a song. Constantly getting useless and annoying notifications about connecting to random people also listening to Spotify but won't give me an accurate notification of what song I'm listening to so that too doesn't work",0
"I can't add a song to multiple playlists at once, please fix this! ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ’”",0
The amount and quality of the ads had been getting worse for some time. Now they are getting political and censoring content.,0
Very nice music app. Other junk apps have ads that interrupt my sleep process. This just works.,1
Love the app but wish the downloaded music didn't take up space on your phone! I can download anything for free all day! Would be nice to see that change in the bear future! Just to be able to download for offline play without using so much phone space,0
"I barely ever turn on the TV anymore. There's just always playing at home or on the go, I LOVE this service",1
"i can't login because everytime i tried to login, it always says that i'm offline, when i'm not. i turned on my mobile data. isn't there any solution for this problem? it's really bugging me",0
"Cuts out all the time for no reason, some times the player doesn't show up and you have to close the app completely to get it back. After an add you have to reset it back to full screen.",0
It's a good music app but only 6 skips per hour is dumb and way to many ads way to many and I hate that you have to shuffle your likes songs like why can't you go in order but it's a good music app but its dumb.,0
Stupid advertiesement is too muchðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ took premiun one time after the premium period was over they keep bugging with more and more ad for premiumðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤,0
"Have been premium family customer for years and years, now it keeps pausing music all the time. Will be spending money elsewhere... Thanks....",0
"I like your wide selection. It is easy to navigate around but I wish you could have my favourite album ""Keith and Enid Sing""",1
Excellent app I support Spotify because they support joe rogan.,1
Easy to use! Great options for listening!,1
I can find ANYTHING I want t listen to; and I love the playlists Spotofy creates for me. I always here new music.,1
"I'm constantly having problems on the app from it not playing downloaded music offline, it randomly stopping, a track showing its playing but then it not playing an more.... When it works it's great but I'm so frequently having problems. If it worked as it should I would happily give 5 stars but ATM it's faulty",0
Great Playlists !! Lots of options for the mood ðŸ˜Œ,1
App crashing randomly and mini player disappears,0
"I recently upgraded to Spotify Premium, so no adds! It is the ONLY music service I found that has songs from the K-Drama world. I love the addition of the lyrics.",0
I love this app its so like if youre like on a car ride Its really just relaxing to listen to music while youre on a car ride its like if there was a 10 I would give it a 10 out of 10 like this is one of my favorite apps I have gottenand it is so like this so many songs that you could find like some of them you might not know but you like them so like I really love the ones that I never knew about like but I ended up liking it so and now it to my likes and its just so fun to list,1
Love the app for functions/content. It's had a couple of bugs lately with 'currently playing' requiring shut down to bypass. And the continued support of Joe Rogan will keep the rating down.,0
The app is not working on moto g52 5g. The app opens and nothing happens it will be in opening app state only.,0
Excellent content and so much choice.,1
Bug: Can't share songs. Edit: Problem solved.,0
Nice,1
I haven't had any trouble finding the music just finding the right app for the sound and base boost got the X BOOSTER but still does pretty good.,1
"3 hours into your 5 hours podcast? Spotify will probably switch the episode on you while you're listening, then erase your time mark so while you're doing 85mph down the freeway you get your podcast completely interrupted and now you have no idea where you were at. Seriously Spotify, if youtube can remember where I was at on a video I haven't watched in half a year you could at least remember where I was at 5 seconds ago",0
"I highly recommend using this, no subscription needed to enjoy!",0
The app is really very good. It is easy to use. The only drawback is the mistakes in lyrics,1
"music soothes me and my pain, i am so grateful to spotify!!",1
When I play my playlist random songs play that I don't even know,0
"The current version gets so buggy again. My music automatically stops every few minutes, and the playback control bar doesn't even show and I have to kill the app to get back normal again",0
"This is a very important thing for me beeing as how music makes up 85% of my everyday. Pandora had let me down at this point, and as reluctant as i was to try something that i thought would be similar it actually blew my expectations. at first it was free, but for only a small free for my much needed music i get everything i want with ease all day everyday 24/7 with an amazing customer service to boot! Spotify changed my game and i appreciate every second! Thank you truly no complaints!",1
"I've been a premium member for years , never had a problem . Great selection , broken into generes which makes it easier to find the kind of music you're looking for. Fair pricing , I don't mind paying $17 a month for it because I use it all the time & we have other accounts we can let our family use. I love it !",1
"I refrained from giving 5 stars only because of the ads, otherwise the app is the best. Recently there are too many ads, hope they would work on it. Edit : I've finally got the premium subscription. Feels good to not have to listen to the irritating ads",1
I love it we had Pandora before and it kept repeating the same song I think Spotify is the favorite in our house,1
"Just updated the app, and am facing issues similar to others i.e. cannot see the play bar. I am also experiencing more app crashes. In addition, Spotify is not working with Android Auto - there is an error message along the lines of, ""Spotify is not working"". Previously, I have had no issues with Spotify on Android Auto. I have had a great experience with Spotify before this update, so am really hoping these bugs can be fixed!",0
"My profile doesn't even show up, and my playlists don't show up. It's been going on for months. Only the app has the problem, I can use the website just fine",1
Its not free only premium,1
Great better than YouTube music,1
"An amazing app for music lovers... I tell u to try it, I has stories, songs,poems, everything...",1
Latest update absolutely sucks. I just recently downloaded it again after a months and I'm very disappointed. They've removed the feature where u can play a short snippet of the song before adding to a Playlist and that just irritates me rn,0
"This has the worst possible optimization for older phones. There needs to be a lighter version that isn't so intensive on processing, every other app is operable besides this one.",0
Slow to play songs...,0
"Thank you Neil Young! I never considered downloading Spotify until you threw your temper tantrum. I'm not interested in podcasts, and don't care about Joe Rogan, but I will defend his right to say what he wants in a FREE WORLD. So I downloaded Spotify to spite you, and it turns out that I am loving it! This is a great app. I wish I had downloaded it sooner. Stand firm Spotify on the side of open, free, and fair discourse!",1
Lyrics  music yall,1
Love the varieties of music & podcasts.,1
Incredible app with very easy yo use features.,1
Too many ads.,0
Really good since you don't have to pay to have your screen off while still having the music playing,1
"I pay for Spotify premium, still get bombarded with ads when listening to podcasts. Some are worse than others. Luckily my favorite podcast network is no longer Spotify exclusive, there's no reason for me to pay for this anymore.",0
All it has to do is play music. Constant updates degrade core functionality. Seems keeping the music playing when the screen is off can be a struggle for the engineers at spotify. And I pay for it... figure it out,0
Worst app not songs only adds wast of data,0
"After the last update, they're having a lot of problems again. The music doesn't stop automatically anymore when is connected by Bluetooth, if ur using Bluetooth it just keeping running even when you disconnect it, its horrible i cant just listen to music carefree anymore... Ya'll need to fix that Bluetooth problem and It's also having issues while is playing music it just stops randomly and then it suddenly stats agian.",0
"Toooooo many ads....its irritating.an ad between 2 songs...worst uh.. Other than ads u can find all the songs, playlists... I'm gonna uninstall it due to ads ðŸ˜’",0
"Had it for years, couldn't imagine life without it. There isn't a day that goes by I don't use it",0
"Everytime it's showing ""You're offline, no internet connection"" though I have a decent internet connection.",0
"The app keeps improving but then they go ahead and make some very bad changes, like the mini player disappearing when scrolling down (but not up?), They seriously need to stop messing with what's already good and do something that works for the buggy parts",0
"The ad increase is quite unexpected, between every song I get 3-4 ads. I realized I'm starting to get more ad time than vibe time. There's a way around them, for free, but that's my secret. Spotify, do better, the ads are getting out of hand. Starting to look like Pandora!",0
My favorite music always.,1
This app is extremely garbage I just love how you can't close a song that you didn't even pick. Loaded with ads can't skip more that 6 times what is this bs?!!!! I use to love Spotify but now it's trash. It is so buggy doesn't work. Real rating is 0/5.,0
Really good app. I have many different playlist and I send them out to friends. Love it.,1
"Generally good, but local files are an absolute mess, they definitely need to get an update. Another thing that it's lacking in is more social features. Some big bugs and crashes occur quite often.",0
Best i recommend downloading this...if you are reading this download.,1
Great app. So far at least couple of hours daily,1
"Resso app better than for spotify. No subscription in resso (quality) best, Spotify subscription (quality) best",1
Pretty easy for me to navigate......this BABY BOOMER isn't very tech savvy ðŸ™ƒ,0
I haven't had a better experience with streaming apps than Spotify!,0
Fabulous app,1
Has just about everything u can think of and easy to use,1
I've been listening to music at work or in the car and it just stops playing every other song sometime multiple times during the same one and the app keeps crashing it sucks,0
"App is missing a lot of very obvious features. Needs a ""shuffle album"" and ""shuffle artist"" button like every other media player since time began. Needs to be able to scroll back in the Queue to see what's already played.",0
Just awesome. I've been with Spotify for years.,1
"Last update have serious bug, confirmed happened not just to my device but my friends as well. Song play half way will stop by itself. Control bar will be ""disappear"" on the app regardless how you switch to library, search or other pages. By ""Close by force"", and reopen Spotify app, it will working again. Very annoying. Please fix. Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. Android 12 (One UI 4.1). Confirmed Spotify app update to latest version.",0
App keeps crashing. I can't play a single song or podcast,0
I love this app. I special open the for the rating because this app is hits your choice. Superb ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Šâ¤ï¸ðŸ¥°,1
This app sucks like i cant make an account even if i used all of my account info can you fix this server or any thing to fix it asap,0
Such a useless app. Network is perfect and also other music app working but here it shows no network. You also want premium version network like your ads like to ask all the time.,0
Worked great for a couple years but now it constantly freezes. The pause and play buttons stop working and I have to uninstall and reinstall. Also it no longer continues playing similar music when it runs out of a playlist.,0
"Trash app, Even on my own Playlists and Liked songs I can't choose my desired song and needed to be shuffled, oh and what's more is the limited skips. I used to love this app so much because I love listening to music but all of what I said ruined this app. Recent updates just pushes users to buy premium accounts. If I could only give a negative star review on this app",0
The music app is amazing but just one small problem.... The auto Play feature doesn't work properly... It just stops at the current song and then I have to reinstall the app to make it work again and after some time I have to repeat the process,0
"I didn't get to listen to one song but oh boy I love 45+ minutes of straight back to back ads, sure it has an option to skip but it just plays another and I just want to hit play and put the phone down not sit there and skip ad after ad after ad after ad after ad.. see it gets annoying just stop you are a multi million dollar company, f off with all the ads",0
"Far too many ad interrruptions particularly spotify premium non-stop tedious ads, while most of the other ads are annoying and not relevant to me, don't mind listening to ads if these were fewer, relevant and interesting.",0
Amazing as expected. It does get a little glitchy on Note 8 at times but an update fixes it fairly quickly.,0
"i dont know why cant i play music when offline, can anyone tell me?",0
To many commercials I can't listen to 2 songs without 4 commercials before and after. Bye Felicia!,0
"What's with this annoying new ""car"" update? It's a pain! Why must technology companies feel the need to try to control our in-car behaviour? We are adults!!",0
"A must app. But payment issues in Nepal and can we download the lyrics please. Considering these minor things , Spotify is great app to listen to music",1
Great app. Ads may seem a bit annoying but they have to earn as well.,0
Nice . Really good and great audio quality. I love it.,1
Wanted to queue my Playlist. Couldn't find that option,0
"Unstable. The app no longer shows what podcast I'm listening to so I cannot pause or skip. The only work around to this is to close the app and restart it. It also no longer shows on my lock screen. Another recent issue is when I connect my phone to my car and play a song, the app will stop the song and skip to another one randomly. This is not a phone issue as it only started to occur with the latest app update. I am using a Samsung S22 Ultra.",0
I would give it 5 stars but it has increased the ads frequency between two songs,1
This app is great and all but sometimes when I click on a song I want to listen to it gives me a whole other song,1
When I play a podcast most of the time now it doesn't have the page to set a timer or fast forward the podcast etc. Considering I'm paying premium I expect better,0
"Since I've gotten premium, whenever I close the app and come back let's say, 3 hours later, the timer says 3 hours over 3 minutes, and when I tap play, it skips the song. It happens all the time with songs AND podcasts. Also, when I come back to the app and press play, it plays for a sec, and then stops, requiring me to press play again.",0
Its best app for music I used to listen old song of india,1
The widget doesn't work anymore and I always use it! Please try to fix it :(,0
Bloody updates since recently updating now its constantly crushing and playing by itself...,0
"Alright ig but omg stop adding songs, suggest them sure but dont add them to my playlist, if i want a song on my playlist i will add it so just dont its just so annoying",0
"Nice enough app for listening to various kinds of music. Ads may irritate , otherwise fine",0
Love it with spotify felling happyðŸ¥°,1
Has all the music I listen to! Quality is good too.,1
It's so good for listening to music and it has the best music ðŸŽ¼ so pls download this app ðŸ¤ªðŸ˜Ž,1
"Generally I'm happy with the service, but the app is getting more and more annoying. It's not nice to ask for Bluetooth or push notifications every time I open the app, especially after I just denied them again. Sometimes I experience sudden stops of music.",0
I love listening to music I can get all my music and playlist here try it out,1
Absolute junk on my Note 11. Wouldn't shut off. Changes songs at will/mid song. Plays songs in the background when it's supposed to be turned off. Not worth the hassle!,0
"I'm fairly new to the app, but I've love listening pretty much all day long - with only breaks to charge my ear buds! I've exclusively been listening to BTS and there are some great suggestions that I hadn't heard yet. So Thanks, Spotify! I like that I can add to favorites & there's a cool feature to also skip songs (which the button is too close to the Next button, but that's cuz I shove my phone in a pocket and it's accessible from the lock screen- which is handy and not sometimes) Thank you!",1
"The app is rich when it comes to the music catalogue, with an option to access podcasts as well. Makes my life more enjoyable.",1
Best Music player ive had in a long time I even bought premium .,1
"Fix the fix to the NPB please. It's better than it was, but it still disappears.",0
"I've been with Spotify for several years now and I can't deny their services has been great. But lately the app has either been playing without permission, been buggy as ever, and or just won't run. It's getting annoying and making me reconsider.",1
I have lost my podcast on multiple occasions while in the middle of an episode then I have to find my place again. The only reason I give more than 1 star is the music algorithm but I can find better at other places.,0
Doesn't let me skip recommended songs even when I had skips left,1
Very good music streaming app. It's Ai is much developed to satisfy your taste of music with recommendations.,1
You are paying for a service that keeps crashing. Used to be brilliant but ever since the beginning of 2022 it's been filled with bugs.,0
"I used to love it, now it crashes my phones Bluetooth any time a launch it. This has been an ongoing problem for a couple months, id recommend looking for another more stable app where you will get your money's worth",0
Spotify thinks there slick running adds after every two songs,0
Wonderful to have so much great music at your fingertips. An excellent service.,1
Perfect app for music I recommend it,1
"Please developers add: a way to ""Multi Add to Playlists"" so we can add songs in several playlists at once.",0
Great app but ive had issues with the new update my music keeps pausing during songs,0
"I just like this app..But always stay ads,many times can very long but many songs, many artist, and I think all songs could be here.I love this app,but lyrics are here and I love it so go on ..good job I love you all",1
"I was having a great time with the app until they made CHOOSING the song you want to play a ""PREMIUM FEATURE"" and now this app has become practactly USELESS without this feature being free. I don't even know WHY they did this but now I have to spend MONEY on a previously FREE feature! Developers PLEASE make CHOOSING the song you want to play a FREE feature LIKE BEFORE! PLEASE!!! If you do this ONE THING I will change my review to a 5 stare LIKE BEFORE!",0
Perfect,1
"This is a great app,i can find any song I need to listen",1
Great app easy to use and has everything I like to listen to,1
"Stop turning down my volume. No, it's not a setting on my phone, yes I tried the volume equalizer on and off, yes I tried resetting and reinstalling app. Frustrated and done with this ridiculous problem",0
When I go out I want to listen to Spotify but it won't work,0
"One of my best app! Spotify= LoveðŸ’“ This app has all types of songs, like anime, jpop which I'm so interested in. Even though I didn't have a premium subscription, ads became a part of journey and I even sing those ads sometimes too! I use Spotify more than any other app on my device. Thanks for making a great app!ðŸ’“",1
Really like their set up and it's user friendly!!!,1
"Not sure what the newest update was supposed to do, but since the update I've had constant glitches making the app very difficult and frustrating to use even if using the paid version.",0
Just get it,1
"Edit April 13: the reliability and stability of Spotify has absolutely plummeted. I don't know if it's the Spotify app, the new Android OS, or a combination of both. But I've lost a lot of faith in it within these last few months. I don't like subscription based apps. But this one to me is justifiable. Seamless transitions from phone, to pc, to Xbox, to Bluetooth in my vehicle. It rarely has issues and obviously has the widest selection of music. Hands down best way to listen to music or talks.",0
Performance is very poor When i search for music and I tap the play button it play different much,0
I always have service even working in a warehouse if I go out of town. I listen to music like people watch TV. Music is therapy and it's a constant thing in my house. I love the no ads/ commercials either,1
Good music selection but the app constantly glitches. My music is playing as I type this but it says Spotify is trying to play. I can't skip through songs when this is happening. Think I might be going back to YouTube music.,0
"Free version is a bad as local radio. It says 30 minutes of commercial free, as long as you don't skip a song or artist",0
I love Spotify but I can't shuffle my music anymore it just has that play button,0
"Didn't like the new update. I can't even put a song on repeat anymore. It's all on ""shuffle mode"" and I don't enjoy it. I'm switching over to Pandora until they fix this",0
Have no pop up for current music playing and spofity keeps stopping music out of nowhere. Please update,0
"Used to be really good, since beginning of February 2022 app and Windows versions both state ""offline please check connection and try again"" I'm always connected to the Internet while using pc and phone via WiFi and still no joy. I've even uninstalled both and as spotify doesn't recognise my WiFi I can't log back in. Please fix.",1
Songs playing time Unvantad Ads coming in Spotify,0
Love the music selection and creation of playlists,1
Spotify is great but just like other technology its being used to harm ppl and for revenge on unsuspecting ppl that have no idea what is going on til its to late. I dont know anything about computer or phones but i have common sense and can figure out someone has ill intentions towards me and no ally or individual to confide in.,0
"Great playback, way better than YouTube ,or Amazon music apps",1
It keeps turning on the album repeat and its getting on my nerves its happening to my buddies Spotify as well Please fix still love you btches3,1
"This app is very easy to use and very useful for waking, studying etc.",1
Very good and I love it. Premium is so worth it if you buy it,1
Constantly stops playing randomly. In the middle of podcasts it will stop and mark as played when there is half of the show left. Will randomly stop playing music.,0
"WOW!! ....all of a sudden my login doesn't work. Even though I'm 100% positive it is correct. This morning my app asks me to login? Why? This hasn't happened before, so obviously you are having some problems. Just found an email in my account telling me to change my password because of 'suspicious behaviour'.... yeah because logging into Spotify on my Xbox is suspicious!? Thanks for the stress this morning, didn't need that. I won't be renewing....my way of teaching you a lesson.",0
"It's Really amazing,since am a music lover I can literally sleep in spotify",1
Live it the best podcast music everything,1
I Likes Spotify! recommended,1
It is not showing lyrics and also it chrashes while finding friends. Please fix it ðŸ™.,0
"Convenient to use this app is really refresh my mood good app for listening your favorite music, podcast music,create playlist and many more.",1
It's basically freedom at it's finest if you already have Spotify for your PC or tv then get the app too to easily keep learning,1
Where's the Exit button? Keeps running in background. I have to go into settings to Force it to Stop. Or have to clear memory to get rid of it? Rather than that hassle I'm uninstalling it.,0
Why is there a Spotify added song's in our playlist and liked songs... It's the most annoying feature where we can't even remove the shuffle song feature... Seriously considering uninstalling Spotify,0
Literally trash. There's 50 features I can think of that they're missing on top of the total garbage functionality. Literally any tech person could explain in detail how ridiculously disappointing this app is. Where's all the money going they're stealing from the Artists and Podcasters? Definitely lining the pockets of the executives and not adding a basic feature like listening history. Terrible app and you should feel bad for how terrible it is.,0
"It's a really good app,just that,i have some problems.Everytime i try to play songs from my library,from favorites,it won't work,and it plays something else.Also,the 6skips we are given every hour.Don't you think it's to much?I mean,i would like to be able to skip more. Please fix these. Thank you,have a good day.",1
Quality of song is extraordinary but this app subscription amount is high,1
Tis app is good for the mental stress because every song has clear word which is cool for music lovers,1
"Brilliant, intuitive and smooth",1
"Spotify is great I love it, mainly because I listen to music 24/7 but my main problem with the app is the fact that it barely ever plays the songs on my Playlist, it just play suggested songs before it even thinks about the songs that I actually want to listen to. This even happens when I play my liked songs.",0
"Every song I enjoy is here, even old unpopular songs can be found. Never turn on the radio again",0
Its really relaxing and pretty cool,1
I dont know what happened but this app turned to trash real fast. Mid episode of a podcast and it lost the entire episode. It's just gone.,0
"Try to listen to amalee latest album. Rise of the monarch, but everytime I try and I get a play list of random songs. Some amalee but most form random different artists. After 15 attempts I still only heard 3 of 10 song out of the album.",0
Im deleting your bug ridden app. The only good thing on it was joe rogan but i see you are sneakily removing back episodes because of pressure. Disgusting.,0
The always have the songs I want and like to listen to.ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
Full of misinformation and bad sound quality.,0
Love Spotify! Big time love it!,1
Love the app it for free,1
"Couple of bugs when you have a slow internet connection other than that, a better option for any music player.",0
The only improvement I'd make to Spotify would be to be able suggest songs to friends in the app.,0
why do you keep updating it ffs your making it worse! if it aint broke dont fix it whoever makes the updates for this sack them on the spot hes a retard.,0
"Easy to use, I was able to make a great play list that I can listen to anywhere. Able to use with my phone or laptop.",1
Just recently been using a Spotify premium trial and i can't even use it without the app force closing itself when I'm using another app fix it,0
"You can't go back when you playing your music, you can't play a single song. Also, there's no way you can view the album track list, it plays random track on the album. Difficult and complex app ever. It doesn't give the use the power to use it.",0
"I want to stop the default shuffle on EVERY playlist EVERY time. UGH, UGH, UGH Also why is it so hard to clear the queue? Do it one at a time? Here's an idea, listen to your customers.",0
"Bugs out constantly, stops playing music randomly for no reason. No longer works with my smartwatch. The whole interface is an absolute mess! Could really use some cleaning.",0
So far good just need to load more groups,1
Spotify won't let themselves be bullied in to submission. Downloaded and use Spotify for that exact reason.,1
Help full or nice app show only one app Spotify play now,0
Got everything Also build your own playlist,1
"After the update, it's so buggy and won't even let me share my playlist and always ""something went wrong"".",0
"Crashing constantly, uninstalled and trying again. Crashes when I press the search bar. Also attempting to use SD card to store music is a compleye waste of time, it just doesn't work. If a fix isn't sorted very soon my money goes to Amazon. (Premium)",0
It would be nice if podcasts weren't filled with ads and you could see the song currently playing.,1
"It took me a while, but I'm uninstalling this app and deleting my account because of Spotify's continuing support of Joe Rogan. I know I'm not even a drop in the bucket compared to the millions of other subscribers, but this is the best method I have to express my feelings about it.",1
Nice app.but when I try to play a song that's In a Playlist all the songs come up and I can't hear the song that I chose.i will rate this a 4.5 out if 5.,0
"I'm a premium holder for years and to be honest recently it has been terrible. It pauses for bo reason wether I'm online and offline, it turns off randomly and changes songs without any reason. Will be cancelling my premium if this isn't sorted.",0
Manymore ad. Not skip option. Ad playing 50 sec approx..,1
Unexplainable. I'm extremely happy eith Spotify ever since i been introduced to it last year by a friend. I'm rating 5 ðŸŒŸ's,1
"I've only been having issues recently, app keeps randomly stopping the music, not showing me what I'm plsying either in notification OR in the app, and I have to shut the app off completely if I wanna pause... it's annoying",0
It's a Nice app for listening all The language songa I love this app you have to download this is nice But the ads are into it but not th,0
"It's a great app and the best mp3 music app I have ever used but there is one problem that, why can't we play some songs or find some songs? despite this the app is wonderful I recommend it. it's just the best.",1
This app is very boring and contains so much ads don't download if you taking subscription then it is ok,1
Works very well when your hearing downloaded music,1
Great selection of music and the always play what I like,1
Why are the ads way louder than the music?? They play 3 ads between only 2 songs. The premium price is high like Netflix. You can't go through albums and add songs you have to type each individual song to add. You can only add a lot through other Playlist but not artist albums.,0
Only downloaded Spotify because y'all did cancel Joe Rogan!!! And now I'm going to go follow him and look for other great artists!!! Thank you Spotify I'm sure I'll be very happy with the appðŸ˜Š,1
great app on a ipad or phone but on my laptop it tends to be giltchy and not let me use the app. i would definitly recomend on phones or tablets but not on laptops.,0
Really love this music app. Wish it featured more songs,1
"Really, it's like all the other ones out there that I've tried, they all have there quirks and sometimes issues but it is what it is. But I do prefer it over Pandora.",1
Spotify now plays ads even for premium subscribers. This is unacceptable.,0
Can you please bring back the slider/scroller bar so that we can quickly scrub through our playlists? It comes and goes with every update and I wish it would just stay.,0
I like this app even though the ads is a lot which is a bit disturbing when I listen to music,1
I only have one complaint and that is where did the enhance a playlist button go. I really enjoyed that for expanding my playlists,1
Since the update it takes longer to start app. Also its constantly downloading Playlist.,0
"This is the absolute best for music listening, especially if you are ready to pay for your music. The quality is really supreme and crystal clear. Worth the cost of premium membership.",1
Truly amazing and beautiful app. Brings back the beauty of music and pretty good playlists.,1
"It's the worst app I've ever used, especially the PC. Please stop cause you're corrupt",0
standards are exceptional..,1
Good job Spotify. You bee spot on.,1
Spotify has always since I have been usin it fulfills my expectations by far as far as knowin what me as a listener loves . And that's tha BEST music app for tha BEST MUSIC. 5â­s in my book all Damm day Homies.,1
"It's not bad. Biggest music selection, works pretty good. I left it in Offline Mode once and restarted my phone, oh boy that caused a bunch of annoyance. It would never recognize me being online, wouldn't login, long story short had to uninstall and reinstall and lost all my downloads. It does constantly download playlists even if they aren't updated which slows my phone down. I guess I'm use to it. Try it out, see what you think.",0
Best song collection app,1
This app was working just fine and I was listening to my favourite songs and having a great time. Now the app just crashes whenever I play any song. Please resolve this issue asap,1
"Lately, the app has been riddled with bugs. Keeps crashing (stops playing completely) and also displays different music/podcast to what's actually playing. Very annoying. Also slow connection even though every other app has no issue with my connection. (Update on 12 Apr 2022) Uhhhh... Where's the controls to pause/play music?! Great job Spotify. I have to actually kill the app to stop the music. Seriously considering moving to Tidal.",0
It's been acting really sketchy bro. None of my liked songs are showing up on phone now and if I didn't like if on my phone it literally shows nothing...it wouldn't even let me.log out,0
This Spotify app is good. Keep up the good work.,1
"Always a great service, even with ads. Just makes it feel like a radio!",1
"I have had problems with this app for weeks. Not able to play music, download any music. And why have I lost all my play list? So I'm paying for something I can't even use. This problems seriously needs fixing. And had well over 8 thousand songs. And its the only thing that relaxes me. Fix this",0
"Without Spotify Premium, you're forced to listen on Shuffle and you only have 6 skips an hour. You can't even turn off songs playing after your playlist ends. This app is only good for listening to music in the background while playing a game or something. Doesn't even compare to YT music.",0
Music plays randomly for 1 second then stops. This happens when I'm not actively listening to music on my phone. My phone is just lying somewhere and it'll start playing for a second on speaker.,0
Constantly bugging out. Can't have playback bar for more than one song. Touch controls from earbuds have stopped working. Can't stop music from playing unless you close the app. Spotify has been around far too long to still be this sloppy,0
"Works very well and love it, although sucks when some songs are unable to be played",1
It's as good as the desktop app bar a few missing features. None of which spring to mind ATM...,1
This is an amazing app for listening to music I use it all the time,1
Turns off stops all the time the worst app ever,0
Excelent selection and quality sound,1
Sound quality has deteriorated and the volume is suuuper quiet,0
I like the fact that you can find so much music but there is sooo much to dislike like the fact that I can't choose what to listen to and every thing is shuffled and I can't listen to whatever I want and if I put one music in a playlist to listen to it They add music out of no where its annoying,0
I love Spotify. I can stream all of foreign language classes.,1
"Its a good platform for music and podcasts, if it loads, I have to close and reopen the app multiple times just to listen to music, and if I'm not in the app for a bit and try to go back, I have to do it again",1
This app is very very super duper nice!!!,1
"The app is generally good except for the fact that you have no control over your listening history. There was a time we could delete it but now I think they prefer the TikTok model where once you listen to a song, the AI uses it FOREVER to influence your recommendations.",1
Amazing service. I love the new updates! This is by far my favorite streaming service. I have set up so many of my friends and family on here now. They all love it!,1
"Don't say 30 min. no ads if its actually 8, thats just weird and rude. I liked it but it hasnt been working well for a while so I'll need to find another music app ðŸ˜’ i would rather not have to set up playlists again somewhere else but i thought they would fix the problems by now. Update: this app is still busted. Actually no, it got worse. Why have a free version if it doesn't really work?",0
I don't know whts the problem.... I never get lyrics below.... Is that a different app.. Or this app has default ?...,0
I have never seen a app like Spotify to listen to song.best appðŸ‘â¤ï¸,1
Sound is very clear and no issues,1
I'm in awe that I have to pay a subscription just to turn off the shuffle on mobile app this just tells us that your money hungry,0
Being able to create a Playlist of my many favorites is a plus. The ads are not intrusive love the price of premium status. Great for music lovers!,1
"I always get ""there is no internet connection, there is no internet connection "" i can't able to listen the songs due to the low capacity of network . I have wifi even though I couldn't hear my favourite songs . I really disrespect this app",0
It is so nice not hearing annoying commercials,1
"One of the best music app,to listen and discover new music.great selection and quality plus very user friendly.",1
Great way to listen to all of your music,1
The player controls keep disappearing and it's really harshing my mellow. Please fix it Spotify,0
Wayyyyy to many ads it's genuinely like four thirty second ads for a tiny bit of music.,0
"great, but there are adds 24/7",1
it's a good experience but why wont it shows the lyrics?,1
"Wanted to listen to 1 song. Watched an add. Finished song and moved to random song Wanted to listen to same song again. Pressed song again, still random song. Closed app. Opened, watched another advert. Pressed song I wanted, still random song. Created play list with only the song i want in it, still random song. Keeps playing ads. Day ruined. I could just be dumb tho.",0
"Other reviewers say they have had problems with the app. I've had zero issues. Maybe they are using an older phone? Been using the app on a Pixel 4,5 and now on the Pixel 6. No problems. Seriously giving YouTube a run for it's money. As Spotify grows and expands, YouTube will become increasingly irrelevant. Just my prediction. I used to watch YouTube 2-3 times per week. I'm on Spotify everyday now. You can always find something interesting to listen to with Spotify.",0
Everything is paid even we can not play our favorite part and also,1
Good music i can find heheh even old music hehe,1
I enjoy the made for me playlists ,1
The app crashes on my device too much. It doesn't load. I have a premium account but I m unable to access it from my phone. Please fix the issue.,0
"I like the app, it is probably the best way to listen to music. One thing that is annoying is that one or twice every month, my downloads delete themselves. This may not sound that bad but I have over 100 podcast episodes downloaded and there is no mass download button for podcast, so I must click download on every single episode. I'm still not sure what causes the app to just delete my downloads but it's very infuriating.",0
"Awesome app, i like adds. Its very beautiful to here. Especially zomato add.",1
"Never used the app /service before, but now I want thanks to Joe Rogan n Spotify backbone regarding this whole controversy thing. If they came cuz it was built, now let them leave if so they choose, real family and friends stay behind and let the new follow and support. (After all, all is being Censored, Monetized, and Perverted.)",1
Everytime I put on a song it plays a different one and I don't like it so I hope you guys can help it stop,0
"Removed the song preview feature before adding it to a playlist, now I have to add a song, listen to the whole thing, then decide to keep it or delete it?",0
What i know about spotify is good music just tips artist name spotify 1ina million ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
The playlist mix the songs that i dont like so I'll give it 3 stars,1
Can be such a great app but please fix the constant glitches :-) Loyalty to the Joe Rogan podcast could very well be the primary reason I have thus far endured the frequent technical issues as a paid subscriber.,0
Its was a vvvvvvvvery good app but its last last update is not good please spotify fix it,0
"Used up a bunch of my data without my knowledge, too hard to change defaults, user interface needs work. However I only had it installed less than 24hrs before I removed it , figured if I was that poor right out the box it could only go downhill from there.",0
"Great app when it works, but this is the third time I've had to reinstall it to try to get it to work",0
"Can't see the play bar,can't skip songs and have to close the app the turn off my music. Not a great user experience at the moment",0
"I have had premium service for several years. I am now looking at finding a new music app. The new update is irritating. My music pauses randomly. This is a huge problem since I use this app while I am driving. Now that the play bar is gone, I can no longer pause, like, unlike, or even know the name of the song or podcast. Please fix this soon. Very bothersome.",0
Could do better at loading when in offline mode since it's all already downloaded,0
Spotify keeps stopping and when i open the app the now playing bar is no longer there. Checked playstore and no update required. vas happenin,0
They gave me 6months free trial and so far love it,1
"I love the discovery of new music. Especially the new techno/electronic composers. Free with ads is great. For now that is okay. I am pleased Spotify can offer the experience of music I enjoy & listen to every day. A subscriber, probably, down the road a bit. I am Patrick doing the rating. Marte is my wife. 46 years together.",1
I love Spotify let's me know when artists I like have new music and great selection of horror podcasts.,1
"every time I want to open an mp3 file on my cellphone, it opens with the Spotify application. is there no option to stop it? please remove that ASAP.",0
"It plays all my favorite songs but I only rate it one star because of too much adds or advertisement, and sometimes when I'm in the mood for songs the adds are always in the way I hope you remove too much adds because it's really annoying to be honest. But still I thank you because it played all my favorite songs:)",1
I love Spotify and do t know what I'd do without it,1
I am unable to login again !!!! Worst app i have ever used to login ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬,0
Spotify is the best music app in the world I love it it has all the music I could ever dream of keep it up,1
The player keep stopping and didn't appear. Keeps crashing after update!!!,0
Thank-you for standing by Joe Rogan. You are helping the free exchange of ideas at a time when narrative is seen as more important than enquiry.,1
All the music I want in one place. Premium is best. Non stop music. Love it,1
The Auto Shuffle sucks would be nice if you would bring back the old way of playing musics like you can manually put it on repeat or shuffle it,0
Love it but group session doesn't work rn so sad :(,0
Has all the music ingrew up with and more,1
I like the Spotify always I listened in my mobile device something I sleep with the music night time and awake listen Spotify.,1
GIVE MONEY,1
Enjoy play like Turns me on to new music Thanks,1
"****ckin ADs every time, the idiotic thing is that they play spotify premium ads every time. 2 ads for between every song, pls dont ruin the music feel.",0
"It aright, my only issue is using the option for cars. It doesnt tell you how to use it and it sucks because using bluetooth decreases the audio quality",0
It application is very useful for peace ,1
I have been a premium subscriber since 2013 as many people are saying the last 6 to 8 months have been absolutely rubbish. I work in very remote locations so you think when I download music I should be able to access my library pfffftttttt not Spotify sometimes taking upto 5 times. I have gone into setting delete catch and data then app and re installing what a joke not happy Spotify please fix or I'm cancelling and deleting app for good,0
good collection of song but there are a lot of ads. Please remove ads.,0
"What is happening to spotify, my account is suddenly sign out and when I open the app to log in, I can't log in.",0
"Seems like a very good idea and would probably benefit a lot more people who have stressful times and they say music is good for the soul it could be very true.I believe that it is my opinion, have fun and thank,2022,05,01.",1
"Love it!!! Very few adds on free version and JRE!!!! I love the freedom to listen to things I want to and not listen to things I don't like. You know, like an adult",1
Haven't had any connectivity issues so far. Pretty good music selection after picking my favorite artist,0
The only reason i installed spotify is because i like playing games and sometimes i cant focus so whenever i play i turn on music and it helps me concentrate and no spotify didn't pay me to say this,0
Why can't I subscribe for premium? The app keeps declining my visa and MasterCards. Do something about this ASAP. P.S. my region is Nigeria.,0
Mini plan doesn't provide high quality music. Then there's no point in buying it. Disappointed with pay to use features,0
Live this app. But the problem is ads. The ads are constantly telling us to get premium. The worse thing is that now i get 2 ads instead of one and maybe even 3!!! This is too much,0
Having issues with playback loosing/forgetting what song I left off on. Tried uninstall and reinstall but issue persists. Recently also noticed music info is not being sent over bluetooth to car anymore.,0
"We can't view the current playing song or cast to a speaker from current song, like it's stuck in car mode, but only halfway. Voice mic is present (like for car mode). You can view it from recently played, but that's as close as it gets.",0
I learned ro sing my gav songs on this aap its so good and there are relaxing asmr sound,1
BRING BACK THE PREVIEW BUTTON WHEN ADDING SONGS. the dumbest update you've ever made was removing it.,0
"Great app but recently it will not play sometimes. I press the play button and nothing happens, or a song or podcast will play but the controls are not visible just the podcast or song list. Can't turn it off unless I shut off the app. This is happening more.",0
"Spotify is a nice app but whenever I played songs while entering to others app, it stop playing I need you to fix this. It is really annoying and there are some songs without lyrics, pls fix this ðŸ™.",0
Was great but since last update it cuts out and not running correctly. It doesn't show controls when playing.,0
Great platform & music selection. Also love the podcast options.,1
Collection is good. Can't say the same for the lyrics feature though... It has been butchered for a tamil movie song and I guess there's a lot of butchering happened.. If you are gonna put the feature please do a QA first.,0
"Purchased Spotify Premium, but had some stuff pile up on me this month, so I cancelled with the intension of going back to premium next week when I had money. I must've clicked through a dozen screens of ""are you sure?"" and ""yes, cancel premium,"" before I finally got to a page that said for sure I was cancelled. Went back to look at my account, and it said my plan would run out in a few days... AND THEY STILL CHARGED ME FOR PREMIUM!!! These a-holes are predatory.",0
I have installed spotify but it isn't playing any song this is the worst experience I am having with spotify . Only playlists are showing up not they wont open up nor I can play any song by search ..please fix this problem as soon as possible because I am missing music,0
I don't think I really enjoy how the new buttons look. They're too bold and too cartoonish. Can we reverse them to the previous thin ones please?,0
I hate that Spotify automatically starts playing when connected to Android auto.,0
Generally a good App. If only one could have it free without adverts. But we live I'm a commercial World.,1
Love it and it doesn't recommend some music from India that I might be interested in like pandopa,1
Frustratingly plays random songs instead of the selection,0
Amazing....only wish is provide more to the Caribbean countries,1
I've been experiencing a few issues for a few months now which is annoying. Search not working entirely until app cache is cleared and restarted. Also music playing but the player not showing up.,0
"I think Spotify is one of the best music services in the world. The song collection is incredible. But other music services have better audio quality than Spotify. So Spotify should add next-gen audio technologies like spatial audio. But overall, it's a great app for music .",1
"Wow, it's impossible to navigate this app. Compared to the desktop version, this has zero accessibility and options. ""Shuffle or buzz off""",0
"When did this app drop the bar so low that it has become such trash. Constant disconnections, anytime you pause and go back to the shuffle it plays all the songs that just played. It's honestly a pain in the butt just to make it work normally. Raise the bar and fix your ish.",0
Nice app for music i can enjoy listening cuz most of the songs are available. But it will be great if lyrics were romanized cuz its difficult to sing along as an international kpop stan,0
"For the last couple of days the media bar disappears when I play a song so I can't stop or pause it. The music stops and starts randomly and if my screen times out the music also stops. SO annoying! They better fix this soon or I'm going to cancel my premium membership. I would hate to see Spotify die like this, they have been such a great App until now.",0
"As from a my perspective, spotify has been the best app for listenting songs as it has been with me in the days when i was feeling the worst and the best . It is just a great app worth paying premium for . All the songs are available from Spanish to Korean to English to Hindi . Everything is just on one place which is the best part !!! I love spotify and i hope you will it worth too !!! ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™",1
Update: Some reason there is an issue with the songs stopping. I use the app while I work and this is frustrating. I pay for the premium service and hope you fix it soon. Other then that I like it. Even that they added the lyrics in.,0
"I used to love using this app, until today. All of a sudden my mobile data doesn't work for it again. ""No internet connection available"" when all other apps are working fine. Checked online and I'm sad to see this is an issue so many people are having and there's no solution",0
Forces offencive and disgusting music into your playlist without permission and has no way to report said music when this happens.,0
"There are alot of adds and the limited skips tends to ruin the experience, but it's the best app I've been able to find. If you buy premium it's alot better, had it for almost 2 years and it's saved me lol",1
"Asking questions from all sides of a topic isn't misinformation or disinformation which is why Spotify is currently better than the propaganda promoting mainstream media news channels who are jealous of your viewing numbers, perhaps if they would adapt to telling the truth for once, their ratings would improve.",1
cancelled. Replaced with YouTube music. I am in Thailand seems to work much better than Spotify which for me was getting glitchier all the time I think. Drop outs...sounding like a scratched CD....failure to properly communicate with google while driving....all add up. If I find a replacement with driving mode...I will jump.,0
"Awesome catalogue of music. Spotify has it all , no need to look elsewhere, they have everything you want in music. So choose Spotify, ""the real deal"" & leave pretenders & ""wannabes"" behind.ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ§ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸ”Š",0
"I've been loving this app. Until recent update, the app starts to act weird. It would stop for a few seconds and I thought it was because of my Bluetooth headphone losing signals. After reading the reviews, it seems like not only me experiencing it, but others as well. Please fix the problem asap.",0
Very good!! Love it u get to listen to ur fav musicâ¤,1
Best app ever â˜ºï¸ don't see ratings just download it fast,1
"I use the app almost every hour of my life and it's great, however a small issue is that sometimes songs downloaded to my device will just become unplayable, and this only happens in my favourites playlist not in downloaded songs",0
"Not worth paying. Audio quality is worse than Apple Music and it doesn't connect to my car properly. No artwork on the display, audio seems lacklustre even with settings changed and it froze my iDrive. Issues the iOS version and Apple Music app doesn't have. Cancelled subscription.",0
Music Keeps on stopping. No matter what i do. I redownloaded it and still has the same issue,0
Good music keep it up,1
Best using platform there is i use it everyday without fail and ive only ever come across 1 song ðŸŽµ I couldn't find on there .,1
Still bugging since the last update. Now playing button still dissapears and the song keeps playing unless one force stops the app...the last update of April 13th didn't fix the issue either.,0
"This app always freezes, takes forever to load/skip songs, and always plays ""Heat of the moment"" by Asia. It's a very bad app",0
Long time subscriber of Spotify but recently having problems with songs that are not downloaded playing.,0
Unable to listen to download music even with subscription unless data is on. Isnt the whole point for paying for offline listen is to listen to music offline.,0
Please correct all the lyrics in every songs and add the subtitles !!!,1
"I've had the app for years, and now all of sudden it keeps randomly shutting off. No warning, no error. And it's the current version.",1
"Facing issues with Group feature on Premium version. Possibly a privacy issue. Please look into it ASAP. Even though I have started a group session, it shows an active one with 3 listeners. However when I open list , it shows only 1 member. Also not able to suspend this ghost session, it gives an error everytime I try. Please help ASAP.",0
Duo doesnt seem to work Only one user has full access to the subscription and is able to playback modify and skip any song as many times as they would like fix this and its an instant 5 star from me,1
Full with Entertainment,1
Love to listening music it makes my day to make me more confidence to think in positive and make plan for my future ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,1
"Great music, all time favourites. Useful application for those who travel often and those who love music. -Badhavi-",1
"I'm okay with the add for 30s, but FOUR TIMES in a row is just to much. But have wide range of songs to select so it's fine I guess?",1
I have Spotify premium family account but I'm unable to add more devices to the list. It is a shame!!,0
Vary good music and good prices,1
"Best app if you are sad or bored you can listen your favourite music, podcasts, Artist or playlists I like this application",0
The selection of music is terrific!,1
"Impossible to find anything in a playlist. Spent months crafting playlists to my liking only to find, out of the blue, most songs give an error message ""this song is not available"". Closing account soon. Should never have gotten Premium.",0
Excellent app with plethora of music,1
Great apps fun to make and find playlists,1
Great listening experience!,1
"Hey Spotify, last update was trash. Take it back. Now my music stops playing. Sometimes I can't even play my music. You're a music and podcast application. Step 1, allow your customers to play music and podcast. Figure it out",0
I love the fact that there is roughly 1300 different music genres world wide. And that because of apps like this it's all accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to listen. Beautiful !!!! ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ¶ðŸ’¿ðŸŽ¸ðŸ¥ðŸŽºðŸ”£ðŸ˜Š,1
"I'm just new to this platform since I was using the web version on my pc and it was great, so I decided to try out the phone version... So if I click a specific song it just plays a random song!!! I tried to use the playlists I made, it's shuffled and adds a random song that idk!!!! But this one thing I discovered is that when I'll use the PC version and the phone version at the same account and at the same time, the phone works perfectly fine, like a remote tho... I hated this pls fix...",0
"i specifically bought premium so i can listen to my playlists whenever i want without internet connection, but tell me why in the hell are half of my playlists unplayable when offline?? not to mention the super lagginess once in a while that forces u to restart your phone for no reason! what a waste of money!!!",0
This app is great it let's me play many songs all for free.,1
"I GAVE IT 2 STAR COZ OF ADS INTERAPTION ðŸ˜‘WAIT,I AM NOT A PREMIUM MEMBER OF SPOTIFY ,BUT WHEN I STARTED TO LISTEN MY FAVOURITE SONG ,AFTER SOMETIME A ADD COME AND IT WILL SAY THAT YOU WILL GET 30 MINUTES UNINTERRUPTED LISTING , I SAY ""OK""BUT BUT AFTER 2 OR 3 MINUTES A NEW ADD COMEðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ - I WILL MEANT THAT -WHY SPOTIFY WILL SAY THAT YOU WILL GET 30 MINUTES UNINTERRUPTED LISTING AFTER THE ADD....WHEN THE 2 ONE (ADD) IS COME AFTER 2 MINITUES ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ , IT'S HAPPENED MANY TIME.....SOLVE IT ....ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„",0
"They seem to want to force you to go Premium? It appears that once you start a track of songs, you cannot remove the notifications and auto starting of the next song(s). Sometimes I just want to listen to a few songs and not the entire track. I haven't found that possible. So while the quality is good, the freedom of choice isn't. Uninstalling....",0
Indias no 1 music world ,1
Because Is easy to go back in the days true Spotify.,1
Whenever I start playing a playlist I don't see the control bar. I have to force close the app and re-open to see it. Need option to completely clear queue. Playlist/queue won't play random mode. It will only play straight through.,0
Perfect app vert less ads,0
excellent app for music. I have Spotify Premium and I personally believe it is well worth the money. I have discovered so much new music from recommendations in the app so I am definitely satisfied.,1
Great sound quality and a very easy to use,1
"Spotify js good to listen to music, but the adds are to much and plus if your going to add ads at least make it so that we can skip them. Also when you add Playlist spotify plays random songs you didn't even add to your play list ik spotify adds some but when you remove it jt still does its just really annoying",0
Worked then didn't. Tried to buy premium...wasn't allowed. Tried free...worked then said id 14 days abroad!!!! Useless. Maybe it's because I'm a Rogan supporter lol,0
Once I uninstalled now I can't even login there are more troubles we can't even login dialy trying,0
Wow ðŸ˜best song app best best,1
"I've been using this app for years and only recently decided to upgrade to premium. I was very excited with all the perks you get. The only downside to it however, is that for some reason I'm still getting adds whenever I listen to podcasts? Which I don't really understand? Because, you know, I'm PAYING for NO ads? I mean I can understand when you get adds from the person you're listening to cuz they're built into the audio. But I've heard the SAME adds in multiple podcasts. Kinda dumb right?ðŸ˜‘",0
The service is great! Just a suggestion about the shuffle of the songs many of them just repeats frequently without playing all the songs in playlist.. the algorithm may need some updates to identify songs already played. Thx.,0
Too many ads. Not able to enjoy the songs...too many ads are coming when compared to other apps..Please reduce the frequency of playing Ads.,0
Works well when abroad.,1
Terrible. I just got premium and now every time I play a song it rather skips or continues to play with no volume even though I have max volume on Spotify and my pc. I would rather have no premium or just listen on YouTube music.,0
You have to buy access to songs instead of playing with shuffle.aaaa,0
I will only give 2 star because its good app in first but until the one new update its not good i can't choose what i want to listen and i can't skip it! It makes me lose my patience that's why uninstall it,0
This app is great except when my playlists are unavailable when they have been downloaded with the premium service? Super irritating and makes you ask the question why you're paying in the first place. Other than that it's one of the best apps when it works.,1
"The app refuses to work. After troubleshooting it with Spotify for over an hour, I was told ""We don't know what the problem is"". I asked for a refund and was told I couldn't have one because I paid via Spotify gift card. So they steal money from people when their product fails.",0
The app keeps on crashing. It's so bad that I'm cancelling my subscription.,0
"Well, I don't really know how to describe it, but the App is full of lags. Keeps crashing, freezing or playing music without me being able to pause or skip, because it says it isn't playing any music but it is. Had to force stop the app because it wouldn't stop playing music. It has been laggy like that for some time now (~1 year) and I'm sick of it.",0
"Use to be sooo good back when I had it, and when I downloaded (free version) you couldn't pick the song u want to play, unless u pay for it. I can't online pay stuff like an app. But probably it is better in the premium vr, but can't pay for it soooo yeah 1 star.",0
Sometimes dubbed songs have the lyrics of the original language's Translate isn't very accurate,0
Best app for music   ,1
"Updates requently break the app, which is frustrating because I pay for premium. Recently the bar at the bottom of the screen keeps disappearing and I can't change the song.",0
This app is good but we can't reply an edited Playlist again,0
evertime i open this app it forceclose,0
"It would have been 5 Stars but the last time I went on, within one hr I heard the same damn YouTube advertisement played. Only two other ads played during that whole time.",0
"Terrible just wants money.... been paying for premium for a year almost and now that I haven't payed they won't even let me in the app to select what Playlist I'm listening to, just give me 2 options 1) pay em or 2) cancel which I don't wanna do as my dad is in charge of our duo account. TERRIBLE STREAMING SERVICE!!!!",0
"Very happy, thanks A very good range of fantastic music Kind regards from Ollie from freezing Frankston 3199 Victoria lol",1
Absolutely brilliant. Never had problems with it. Quick and easy to use. Love the playlists option where you can make your own. Pay for the premium. Best Â£10 a month I spend for no adverts.,1
Brilliant I have music all day. Either through the TV or earphones wouldn't be without it,1
Play bar keeps disappearing.,0
Don't install this app....advertising is more irritate...and say 30mins uninterrupted music but every 2song between 3ads running is more irritate.....why you launch this app for free....I think you play people foolishness ðŸ™„ ðŸ˜’.....sounds good but tooooooooooo much of ads ðŸ™„ ðŸ˜’,0
Would've been 5 star but the shuffle music isnt needed I'm trying to listen to specific song instead it plays a different song,0
Not sure what is going on but the app suddenly pauses my podcasts until I open the app to reject an ad. This is extremely annoying and makes no sense. I already see 3 ads just to start the podcast then listen to 5 or 6 in the podcast. Why all of the sudden they just implement this when it was working fine 2 days ago?,0
"Fix the app!! What is the point in paying for something that crashes all the time? Actually, I would be lucky if it crashed because it wont open most of the time! I am also tired of reinstalling it to work only a few times.",0
"Was great, but after new update it is constantly force closing on its own, or freezing and playing without the play bar. Have to restart regularly. Will give more stars once issue is fixed.",0
"Used to be great. By now, however, there seems to be a probability feature behind everything, starting with simply pressing the play button: Will it work and when? Will my offline playlist still be there when I need it? I gave it some time to review, maybe it was my old phone and internet situation, but after changing both: nope! Still buggy, after months. If you are just starting and don't have sunk cost in playlists/ collections, do yourself a favour and check out the competitors.",0
"Great for listening, except for the ads interrupting the flow of music and the mood.",1
Perfect. Period very usable too,1
Thank you Spotify for fixing this app! It's now much better to use THANK YOU SPOTIFY TEAMðŸ™Œ,0
Nice,1
One of the best music streaming apps out there.,1

"Love spotify, really hate the spotify app sometimes. I don't know why, but in recent months it's been incredibly slow loading things for me. It doesn't seem to be a connection issue, because this happens under any wifi I've used. It's frustrating because the app used to be faster to use, but it seems slower now. Other than that I love the service.",0
Love how playing one song you hear your favorite music,1
Spotify is the best app for listening to the music. It's very user friendly. I also use the desktop application. Even that is fantastic. â¤ï¸ðŸ’– this would be even better if you included an equaliser.,1
"Very much like the new ""Enhance"" feature, has let me add a heap of songs to my playlist that i wouldve added anyways if i had the chance when i first heard them! I've been having problems where my most recent playlist/songs wont automatically start whenever i start up my car. Additionally driving mode doesnt start sometimes. Id love if these could be fixed, as i find i sometimes need to operate the app whilst driving which is against the law for my situation, and is unsafe anyways.",0
You know I really using this app 'cause you can almost find any songs you can think of. But... I don't know if anyone else noticed it the recent updates they changed the spacing of the lyrics it used to be quite wide. But now it looks squishy especially when playing Japanese or Korean songs I feel like I'm reading essay in the lyrics because it's so freaking narrow. I don't know what you're thinking but please give the users of the freedom to changed their prefer appearance of lyrics settings.,0
"Not so great latest update!! The play button at the side doesn't make sense. Also, need to work on landscape mode player window. It's difficult to use when mounted.",0
Best music streaming app.,1
Jay sree Ram,1
best app for music and podcasts thanks to developers,1
A bit crashy and won't play podcasts for some reason,0
Just love all the music....massive!!,1
"No longer possible to play songs in order, they will always be shuffled.",0
"Can't play any song, if i play a song it will quit.",0
"Unless connected with mobile data, it shows no connection and the wifi access to app is allowed",0
Recently Spotify will random stop playing. Or when I play a song it doesn't render it's playing the song. Which I have to then close and re-open the app. Very annoying.,0
It is the best music player app but I am giving 1 star because My all the liked songs are change to unlike and removed from the pinned liked folder,1
"Im trying to play music but it doesnt work. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¤®. The ""fancy layout"" is azz and is so hard to play music on.",0
It's a fine app. One complaint is I can't put a sleep timer on during an ad.,1
Easy to use. Great selection.,1
Very good application for songs.,1
"Great and well worth the subscription free for ad-free music if you listen to music a lot on the move. A few frustrations though that if could be fixed/added, would give it 5 out of 5: 1. Ability to not repeat songs in a playlist until every other song has played. 2. Ability to exit one playlist, go to another, and then be able to come back to the same point in the other playlist. 3. Option to request to Spotify if a track can be added that is not on Spotify. I sometimes have to go to YouTube.",0
"It's a great app no doubt. The one thing that greatly irks me is that the selection of podcasts(and also music, but to a lesser extent) depends on the country of residence, rather than the preferred language. For example I live in France but want my content in English and there's no way to do that. Please change the settings Spotify. I don't think this is a particularly difficult thing to do.",0
Has a ton of great music Have allready recomended Spotify and will continue to do so,1
Exceptional experience especially on music streaming.,1
Very good selection on new and old music,1
music is nice but I'm tired of y'all playing w/ my playlist. y'all are so annoying bro. and the unnecessary updates bro AND THAT ADS! U DONT NEED THAT MANY ADS TO GEY MONEY BRO,0
"Used to be my favourite app on the phone but last month's it's so slow and bugs a lot it's almost impossible to use, I'll probably stop subscription",0
If you have artist canvases enabled the app changes the volume. Have to turn off artist canvases in order to get app to stop adjusting volume back and forth.,0
"It is overall bad app it randomises your songs so you can't pick the specific song you want to listen to, its annoying cus I want to listen to. Sertan songs and u only get 6 skips an hour its stupid and I want it changed the people who gave 5 star reviews all bought premium i can't buy premium so the app is horrible if you can't buy premium id be better of using ytube just delete it its a waist of your time",0
"Oh my gosh, when I was without that app I was dead. USING YOUTUBE MUSIC WITH ABOUT 4 ADS EVERY VID (googled) And Spotify here, gives you 30 MINUTES OF NO ADS FOR LISTENING TO A 10 SECOND AUDIO SAYING ""Enjoy the next 30 minutes without interruptions"" Without this, I would be hopeless.",0
"This app is fine, I like that I can listen to music without paying, but there are too many ad's. And you only get six skips per hour. It's also hard to find the song that you searched for, and most of the time to get to it, you have to use your six skips, and you can't even get it half the time.",0
"I just downloaded it and it's still the worst as ever,, bro just let me play my playlist on order I don't like the shuffle thing, it makes my blood boil",0
"it can be pretty anoying without premium but it is still a good app and when you get premium it is a amazing app for music. i have normally been able to find everysong im looking for. i just wish there werent so many adds but even with them i highly recomend this app. the playlist customization is also very fun, there are also already made playlist which is amazing.",1
App is horrible! ! It is so hard to use and understand how to use. When you try to play a song it plays a different song and you can't even play you play list without premium and if you can how?! I can not figure out this app. Please make it easier and make it so you CAN play the song you want,0
This app is best app for music I love it,1
You should add a thing where if you like the playlist it likes all the songs for and you should make it give you premium for 1 year and then after that year it removes you from premium. Overall it is amazing.,1
I like it from the start but when I play my fav song and it ends it's plays random song update this pls,0
Sometimes the player won't load. Otherwise it's fine.,1
Everything is great but the thing I don't like is recurring ads. Earlier it wasn't like this but now ads come after every one songs. This is very annoying at times. Not everyone can afford premium so please reduce the amount of ads.,0
"Idk what are people on. Awesome app as always. Just pay 5 bucks or just stay quiet. Five bucks is nothing and by paying it, every door opens up. And no, there are no adds on Spotify Premium. Never was.",0
Worse with each update. Just stop trying to improve. Most recent update broke the shuffle function and it has 2 of them now. On the player view and playlist. When I turn off the shuffle on player and then decide to play a specific song it turns the shuffle on if it was somehow switched on on the top of the playlist view,0
Plays and adds random music that you can't get rid of. Won't let me play the songs I wanna play. I hate the new version,1
"the app is pretty ok but the newish design changes are annoying and intrusive. I just want all MY playlists in one place which doesn't need me to add filters or whatever. adding and removing songs is a chore and in general there seems to be a tendency to adding unnecessary and ugly buttons everywhere. Also, why is the basic menu laggy? do we need WiFi constantly to just pull up the tab to add or remove from playlist. The recommendations and compilation albums etc are very good though.",0
Now the app is becoming worse multiple ads are being shown at an inter wal of 10-20 mins,0
Very good app with a wide genre of music!,1
Way too many adverts too distracting,0
Raj Kishora swain,1
I have downloaded the app and it is helpful to me cause I love musicI wish I could get the app again it helps me a lot I love the app ,1
I couldn't find some songs in Spotify and some songs are not able to play .,0
"Only one subscription available from install, why can't we register a family plan from the start. Why does your company need to keep credit card info? Cant you run the subscription service through Google play like other competitors? You make it more difficult than it needs to be...",0
Spotify is better,0
"I've been using spotify for a couple of years now but recently the app shows ""no internet connection"" and I can't listen to my songs if I'm not connected to wifi. I definitely have data plans and I can access apps and youtube that requires internet but for some reason spotify does not work when I am only using data on my phone.",0
"I have over 2000 songs on my Liked songs playlist.. shuffling doesnt exist. No matter how many times i reshuffle my playlist, it still plays the same handful of songs. Absolutely ridiculous",0
Highly recommend,1
Downloaded this app just for the Joe rogan Podcast a good Podcast and along the way I have found several other is several other podcasts that I am enjoying,1
Honestly love it only because I can listen to Baileys murder monday shows and not have to be logged into FB or YT all the time. â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,1
I already disliked this app on mobile anyway but the experience i am having is souring my thoughts on it more. On console and desktop its awsone! But on mobile you really would use this. I repeatedly try to skip songs i already have hidden on the first place so they shouldnt play anway but they still do. And even if i hide a song i dont like it still plays which annoys me. You are better off using some other app than this on mobile. 0/10 if i could give it that rating.,0
Best music app to ever exist,1
Love this app over all other music apps for sure.,1
I love the music but there are some inappropriate content on there that should be removed like inappropriate music covers,0
Please settle all legal matters and make all songs available. A lot of songs not available. Please also allow to add an entire playlist/album to queue. I badly want to switch from Apple Music but as of right now I can't. Update: Best looking music player.,0
Everything is good accept the irritating adds,1
"Tried it for awhile but it wasn't that great. Ended up switching to YouTube music. I thought about returning but they lost neil young and left a podcast which spreads false information which is not ok. I'll be staying away until they decide what is more important, good music or conspiracy podcasts.",0
Best ever ui .please some less ads. I love it,1
"It is great, and although there are still things to improve you can see they hear the user and improve what they need.",1
I love Spotify and I listen to it dailyðŸ¥°,1
Its an amzing app I didnt found any problem in it,0
I use it 6 days as week 14 hours a day this is the absolute best app hands down,1
I definitely enjoy listening to the multitude of songs by the same artist in concession in addition to the other options that complement each song like highlighted lyrics. A nice arrangement which provides a pleasurable way to enjoy music ðŸŽ¶,1
"No music but still having 5G! Even though I have the best internet connection, spotify keeps on telling mee that I don't have internet connection. I have a premium account. I am expecting it to be good",0
"The newer updates make the application barely usable. Can't copy and share my profile and playlists, sometimes the app freezes, slow, and other glitches.",0
Everything is perfect... Just Add Light Theme,1
We need a spotify light mode and canvas option for premium users,0
"Titles and artist names don't work in the car although they worked fine before. Support offers some fixes that don't work, and an ""oh, well, that sucks"" vibe.",0
"Great Music App, but I think it will be even more better if developer adds a sort of Volume control in the app for the gamers who love to play music/podcast while playingðŸ¥°",0
I've been using Spotify for quite some time already. And in general it's cool. But recently I started experience problems with playing songs and podcasts in offline mode. And in general I have an impression that app became more laggy. Hope this is temporary.,0
Had some issues ...but its working now..,1
"I really love this app. expect the add part which is so annoying..it changes the whole vibe..and there are many songs which isn't added yet,will be waiting for that too:)",0
It says ad free music ad free music only in between ads ðŸ’¥ðŸ”ªðŸ”ªðŸ”ªðŸ˜­,0
So hard to use every time I have it play a song it plays a different song. The only thing I is good is the podcasts.,0
"I was thoroughly enjoying Spotify for some time. With the last update, the app keeps crashing no matter what I try to do. I can get a couple of songs in and poof, it shuts down. Not sure if there's a fix in the works, but judging from the negative reviews that were recently deleted it's just not looking good. Hope you can pull it together.",0
No skip option for this app,1
"Dude the app is good and all but just today I was using it and later in the day I check it and it won't let me play my playlist, and random songs are added toy playlist I can't even select a song I want to play I can only listen to it for a short period of time, and it says ""you added"" in your playlist and then bottom part says ""we added"" I don't know what to do I just want to listen to the full songs without random bots adding random songs that I don't even like and have any interest.",0
"i love this app, only one huge problem, the loading, it can take 10 minutes just too load the app and always takes forever to load playlists",0
Hundreds of songs on a Playlist and Spotify decides to only play like 20. Still no fix. Now 1 Star. FIX YOUR APP!,0
Its very good and it's the best way to listen music on the go,1
It gives a great choice in music it's has good sound quality and easy to use,1
"Can't even play the song I want to play, let us freely control our songs and our wants. You add songs on are playlist thinking we would like them, WE WOULDN'T. Don't force us listen to those songs, let us control the songs we want to play cmon",0
"Spotify is a total nightmare are the moment. The app will not play most of the time when connecting headphones or android auto. A lot of the times the app stops playing and will not respond after a few minutes. Then the app will play when you don't want it to. I have tried forcing stop, restarting my phone and uninstalling the app this only fixes the problem in the very short term.",0
"Spotify, you make all my wet dreams come true. I can't thank you enough.",1
App is practically unusable after ANY update. Also now you get ads with premium anyway. I would respectfully like to let Spotify know they should just just shove this app where the light doesn't touch instead of actively making their user experience worse.,0
Verry....verry nice app.... Using since last 3 to 4 yrs..ðŸ˜‰ But plzz add some more songs because there are many songs which i cant able to found in 'spotify'.,1
Good and easy to use,1
This is an awesome music app just what I don't like about it is it has ads in its free account. Otherwise the music is clear and has all the language's songs which is the best thing.,1
Such a useless app couldn't login to my account inspite of trying thousand times irritated by the functioning of this app,0
Great selection and love the streaming service,1
Music is stopping out of no where n I'm starting to get more annoyed about it,0
"Anytime I get a notification from any app while spotify is playing, the sound quality immediately become absolute garbage and does not correct unless I completely restart my phone. This had been going on for a few weeks and it's rendered Spotify almost unusable. Google Pixel 4.",0
"Going to stop paying for this service.... The mobile app is absolutely terrible. So many silly little bugs, with play/pause, displaying what song is playing, doesn't even show up in my notification bar anymore for quick song change..... My next payment will bounce, sorry not sorry. Fix your rubish app or I won't come back.....",0
I give a 5 ðŸŒŸ because I love Spotify it does wonders they even make me my personal playlist. If I could I would give this app 100 I also get my daily horoscope.,0
If I could rate this app 0 stars I would. App runs like garbage.,0
Listen to Spotify all day every day the BEST app out there for musicðŸ¥°,1
"What's up with crashes when viewing video podcast? Other than that, audio features and plagbacks are top notch",0
So far my experience with the Spotify app,1
As a Dj this helps me play dinner music on weddings,1
Love that I have found everything on my list so far !,1
i love it but i cant chose what song in my playlist i want to listen to at all it just gives me a sample of that song if you could fix that it would be great thank you,1
This is an amazing app however I turned off some settings to stop it from adding songs to my playlist or just play songs that arent in someone elses playlist and it doesnt go through Im very disappointed about this and I hope the spotify creators fix this,1
"The ads have become absolutely overwhelming. Playing far too often compared to the music received. Some are incredibly annoying, such as the single earbud Snickers ad. I understand the push for subscription, but I might as well throw YouTube on in the background instead of Spotify. Less frequent and shorter ads with more customizable music options.",0
Great service. App has started to crash a lot. Please fix (galaxy s22),0
Wish there wasn't that many adds. But it's really good app,1
"There's something wierd in this app , i dont want to say somthing just pls bring back the old ver.",0
Okay on my PC I love this app but on my phone I don't like it because when I listen to songs on my phone I can only listen to it randomly.,0
This is just disgusting...I mean I can't listen any of my favourite songs without premium accounts!why?this is not done..If you want to listen songs for free then this is not a good app for that...toooo disappointing,0
My experience is that i have never used a music app that is so pleasant like Spotify before.,1
It's ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© amazing every it has every song perfect for maybe working or gaming,1
"Great app and love the fact that Spotify actually will take time and use some technical thing they have, a simple thing that can see what type of music I like no matter how diverse my playlists and then recommend sons/ artists I may also like. Something other music apps haven't quite managed to master. I also like the fact that as long as the low subscription is up to date, I can still listen to my fave tunes without internet connection that's great as my commute in mainly underground",1
"I downloaded this app to listen to music and I created a playlist but when I click on it, it doesn't play the song that it says it just plays random songs I didn't add and it's really annoying",0
Never have a issue and always find the song or artist,0
Doesn't work on my Xbox and I tried getting help from support and I did everything they ask but still can't fix the problem I believe they need to update the app,0
"The app always has the same error ""No internet connection"". I'm using a 5G band wifi, yet I get the same error. Unable to search music due to this. Terrible experience.",0
"4 stars for actually having some useful features and not being youtube music. It does freeze regularly when restoring from background when not in use. EDIT: currently deletes the player when restoring from sleep. You can press play from a playlist and music starts but can't control anything (pausing, changing songs, etc) from the app, the swipe menu or the lock screen.",0
"Love the app and everything else is working as it should but I can't over the fact that you can't preview the song when adding to an album. I used to add so many songs to my albums but now I don't even have motivation to do any new albums, because I would have to listen to it before going back to the album and adding it...",0
Very useful app for my watch as we can browse thousands of songs on watch itself,1
It's cool I hate how persistent the ads can be sometimes but yeaa,1
Very good app. Very good music. I really love this app. This app is so so easy to use.,1
The app has been buggy since last week. It pauses out of nowhere mid-song. Then bottom bar also disappears and you have to force close the app for it to appear again to be able to control your music. Please fix these bugs ASAP.,0
"""Local"" songs get flagged as unplayable constantly, they dropped support for Kenwood / JVC head units, it uses far more data than it has any right to, syncs terribly and requires a lot of fuffing around to do basic functions. There's not much there worth your time - they've gotten the user base, and now they're complacent and no longer care about making the user experience any good.",0
Pay $15 for premium to have many issues. Offline songs don't load and app crashes frequently.,0
"I switched from Amazon music to Spotify and can't say enough great things about it. It has all the music and podcasts that I want, it paid easily with my car and headphones. Amazing.",1
Audio tracks were already downloaded but cannot be played when I go offline mode,0
"I love it, it's the main streaming service I use for music. There's so much variety.",1
"It's getting more and more buggy. Songs skip periodically even if downloaded, or on strong WiFi. Happens on the website too. And it keeps asking me to allow Bluetooth. This has become a daily ritual.",0
Great option for music,1
Spotify is cool. Easy to browse,1
"Wonderful app,it gives me comfort and keep my soul in the mood I choose as far as music is concern,I never get tired of using this apps.",1
It's not very good you can't even chose the song that you want to hear you have to go through the whole play list And there are way to much ads,0
This Is the best it has a lot of songs you can choose from and its not that many ads but still a bit annoying no offense but hey I LOVE IT I can find and Im so excited I hope they add more beautiful musics And this app its actually kinda educational and you can feel real emotional,1
"Great app, just really enjoy the updated version. Easy to find music and podcasts to whatever is my fancy at that moment.",1
"I pay premium it's worth it for the most part but every couple years I want to clear my liked songs, please please add a feature that allows mobile users to clear ALL liked songs in settings or something (but keep liked songs in playlist)ðŸ™",1
Great app but trash at the same time ðŸ—‘ ðŸš®,0
Love the app as it can even play in background music when am doing something else,1
"I've had spotify since high school, buying spotify premium provided my first ""bill"" and sense of financial responsibility. I've built a truly sentimental relationship with this music app. Recently joe rogan podcast was censored and I'm leaving spotify because of it. I don't need my developers telling me what I can and can't do. Spotify = Sellouts",0
Beautiful app. To have moments with myself!!,1
It's really bad like they give so much ads in between of songs which really creates disturbance for the listeners,0
Work on your albums. I can't get them in collections instead when you go to albums you see playlist,0
Absolutely love this app. My number 1 choice when it comes to my music which I take very seriously!!!!!!!!!! ðŸ’¯ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥ðŸŽµðŸŽšðŸŽ›ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ¤,1
"HI, I love spotify and I realy love listening to my ravorite songs BUT LITERALLY THE PROBLEM IS.. everytime i listen to any musics or probably when i open the spotify app its like i am listening to songs that i have not search or have not played. This always happens bluetooth or not IT ALWAYS DOES. Other comments are true that the new updates.. yeah it sucks.. I miss theolder version of sprotify so pls... fix this... This problem happend a year ago so yeah its kindi anoying me.ðŸ’”ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž",0
Getting so sick and tired of this auto play feature whenever I connect my earphones. I've gone through the settings and there is no option currently to switch this awful feature off. Please fix this.,0
"I used to love this app, it's very relaxing & u can pick any song u want. But I'm very disappointed on the new update, it doesn't let u skip some part of the song & it also won't let u pick any song u like, it will just played a random song. I CANT EVEN PLAY MY OWN PLAYLIST CUZ OF THE SHUFFLE, very disappointing but I'm still hoping the next time y'all update this app, pls remove the shuffle thing & the part when it won't let u skip some part of the song. I hope y'all understand :)",0
Go to music app in love with the premium.,1
Love that there are no commercials,1
"I love this app, it made me discover so many different artists, artist that I would never get to know otherwise. I love the recommendations of new artist and new songs of followed artists. But the app itself has to emprove when transiting between online and offline, I hate when I have a whole album downloaded and I have to go online just for it to appear in the app, when I already downloaded it.",0
The best app for streaming your favorite artists and more!!!,1
Love the ease of use and the huge choice of albums. Use it on Wi-Fi for tunes on our Harley and our patio. Uses very little battery.,1
"Amazing, i get every single songs that i want",1
Good,1
This app is good Very amazing in one year two year back But this year2024is the spotify app is not encourage in free users this app is going in premium paying option I dont like that option But this app is good in few year back This spotify is amazing Spotify members you please cancel the paying option in spotify,1
"Unfortunately mobile app doesn't work for me at all. Can't find music to play, all playlists are empty and even suggested songs from Home do not play. I have a Premium account and all. Works great on PC though.",1
"Mainly use this for Joe Rogan. I have many streaming options. If he gets booted, I'll just delete this.",0
"Why is spotify working badly at the moment? This is quite new, after years of working perfectly. When will it be fixed?",0
Best music app.,1
Doesn't work just stuck on the Spotify logo no matter how many times I uninstalled and reinstalled or clear data or anything it doesn't fix it I have a MUI 12,0
All the music you'll most likely ever need. Except fr or one spanish rock band's song I cannot find) spanish as in Spain. Between 1982-89,0
Spotify is also a good application when there is internet and not good when it is offline,1
Love ad-free premium with all my fave songs!,1
The spotify app is the buggiest app i have ever used. Itll take hours to load my downloads. It redownloads my songs every day using 1 gigabyte of data. Every day. Sometimes itll use my data to download something and 10 gigabytes of data later it hasnt downloaded anything. I hate this app so much. The only reason i still use it is because no other service has the podcasts i like. But if you dont care about podcasts i reccomend getting literally any other music streaming service.,0
can't preview songs while adding to playlists anymore.,0
"I love the Spotify has Personal he designed playlist, That it releases weekly helps me find good new music, it's a great app",1
I love Spotify cause it got my fav music and artists,1
"When I started using this app it was working well but then 1 month in and the app starts making a glitch in were I can't select a song and it says ""This action can not be performed now"" and it is frustrating and if it was a month ago or if they fixed the bug I would've rated it 5 stars but unfortunately this annoying problem popped up.",0
"New music very week, I like it.",1
Every 1 to 3 songs Ads come up SOON ANNOYING,0
Nannayittunde,1
"Hi Spotify team, FYI : Some time back I use to like Chand Baliya song, after listening to your aggressive advertising spaces, I am feeling pukish about the song , but Mr.Aditya the singer ðŸ‘¨â€ðŸŽ¤ ðŸŽ¤ you have ruined your status because of this over aggressive marketing efforts. I am sorry for my shrewd comments, but its time to improvise. Cheers ðŸ»ðŸ‘",0
"I love this music app, the music is amazing then the lyrics ect I think Spotify just has more options compared to other music apps like pandora",1
constantly drops out on Alexa all other streaming works without this problem,0
First time I have routinely listened to music in years,1
very interesting app for songs,1
"I love a wide variety of music (and other) genres. Spotify has fine selections of them. Everything you can imagine, and then some! I've tried other music apps, but Spotify is the BEST!",1
"If you don't have Spotify, you must not love your music ðŸ¤·ðŸ’",0
I love Spotify but if i wanna listen to a specific song on a playlist I CAN'T AND ITS SO ANNOYING,0
i was going to give 5 stars but for that past 2 weeks my playlist will only play specific songs all the way through and others will buffer or not play at all. if this issue were to be resovled i would give a 5 star .,0
So much crashes on MIUI 12.5.The app is good for listening to songs but please fix this bug.,0
It sucks now. After the last update it won't connect to my car radio. I called technical support and they couldn't help me. I guess I need to take my monet somewhere else.,0
"I love this application,its most used app on my phone..",1
I really love sportify,1
"Every update is making this app gradually unusable. Runs really slow, and I have to keep rebooting the app 3 4 times before it will work. Whoever works on this app needs sacked. Obviously incompetent.",0
Thanks for increasing subscription fee without informing. ðŸ˜¡,1
I love the app and I even subscribe to premium but the latest updates caused some inconveniences. Why remove the fast scroll function on the right side of the screen. I believe there is no reason to completely remove a very useful function. The experience when browsing without fast scroll is horrible by having to swipe countless times in a playlist with over a thousand songs. The addition of quick access to search is quite nice but it defeats the purpose when it doesn't play the playlist.,0
I Love the App I rate it 4 Stars Because the songs Stop when I Watch A Video,1
Spotify good pandora bad tidal bad everyone bad but spotify equals good and lovve,1
It's fantasticðŸ¤˜ðŸ˜ðŸ¤˜ New songs are available here and whatever you want to play song this app so useful to listen songs,1
"Hello. So I dont like the fact that the search space in liked songs doesnt appear there. You need to click in the dots then search in liked songs. Its annoying. Another thing if I look just the name of one artist in my liked songs for example Lana del Rey. Then I play any song I expect the next ones to be the other lana del rey songs but no, on the queue there are the other songs from the other artsts from my liked songs and not the LDR songs from the 1 artist I search. Fix it!",0
The removal of the ability to reshuffle an already playing playlist is highly annoying.,0
I love spotify music. It allows me to create play list with various music from different categories for travelling awesome,1
"Don't be mistaken, the music content is top notch albeit no hd music(which I don't think is really important for most consumers).....the issue is .......I save my downloads in SD cards, and in the past ye or so the library took much longer to open.....",0
"It's good and I love the app, but it doesn't let me hear the music before I add it to the playlist which rlly sucks.",0
Its a really good app and i use it all the time! But for some reason the shuffle just plays the name 6 songs:/,0
This app is not opening I even uninstalled and installed it 10 time's a day and it doesn't even opened......! I need a solution for thisâ—â—â—â—â—,0
"Plz fix lag. I close the player AND the app but i still hear the song. Why?! Plz fix quickly, then i change rating.",0
"I think, this is a good collection. As I'm new, I need to discover all the options. I changed to the payed version. The price is correct, I think. So, let's dicover this virtual world",1
Too many ads,0
"Love this app, how can you not, with songs at your fingertips?",1
Finally got tired of the constant email and spamming. You sign up for an app and all you get is constant harassment. No respect for their customers.,0
Some the most beautiful music and non stop! I love it. It's a pleasure listening too!!..,1
It don't turn off when I go to different apps,1
I love this app ..it had all the songs even kpop and pop songs also but i don't like one thing when i turned to play music i gets lot of ads...that i don't like that's why i give 4 stars but the experience is best!,1
Most of the Red hot chili pepper songs are not there !,0
' No internet connection available ' is driving me crazy. It takes few minutes for app to go online. Sometimes it's faster to play a song on YT and deal with ads...,0
I love using it its easy simple and has a lot of the music and podcasts I love thank you spotify!!!,1
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Spotify has the things I needed and didn't even know it.",0
"This app is absolutely terrible. I can't play my songs in the order i want, there are 3 ads every 2 songs and spotify keeps adding songs in my playlist that i don't like. And i can't replay my playlist because of the recommended songs that spotify plays.",0
Extremely good app,1
Our app is really good so 5 stars,1
"Only used it for a few hours before forced to uninstall it. It's like the app can't be stopped if you have a Bluetooth media device connected. Even if U force close the app, songs will start playing if U connect a new headset (eg start Ur car with Bluetooth on) or if U click the call answer/reject button. The only option is to reopen Spotify while the music is playing and stop it again. Spotify will start again if U reconnect your Bluetooth device. Horrible experience. Get some real developers",0
"Very interesting especially when it comes to new songs. I don't even have to look for new music, it's always there.",1
I hate when I'm listening to spotify and a song comes on Like dude let me enjoy my annoying ads in peace,0
I love Spotify it's like the best thing to listen to music on,1
"The best music app I've ever used! Great songs, podcasts and so much more! Would reccomend to anyone I know!",1
Well this app is good But I want to get rid of the auto adding songs that I don't want in my play list so please enable an option to stop that.,0
I love this app and the fact that you can play music anywhere offline once you've saved it. Well worth the cost and I can share it with my boyfriend ðŸŽ‚,1
Was a 5 star before the premium features,1
Just a must for music lovers. Very broad selection of songs for all tastes.,1
Love it but despise the ads.,0
so many bugs lately i cant see control panels i cant even see what song is playing.,0
Its a amazing aap I like it,1
Tbh I would like to kiss Spotify on the mouth for never raising their price from $10 for premium+free Hulu. Editing this just to say that after Netflix raised their prices yet again -_-,0
Ease of use. It would great if the app can remember the lat podcast I was on.,0
Hate it. I have to restart my phone at least 5 times a day just for the app to play anything. I searched in forums for a fix and apparently turning phone off and on is the only fix. I use to like this app but now it's frustrating to use it. And by the other user comments it seems I'm not alone.,0
Excellent app for music lovers,1
"Want to listen to music? . You can listen to any music on Spotify. Music you liked will pop up. You can also have lyrics(if you want them). I love this app so I'm giving it five stars âœ¨ There is an advert every half an hour but if you get prenium, no ads at all! It is a great app and anyone who likes music can install this app!",1
why when i put multiple songs on queue it starts playing by the last one i added instead of the first one? for the love of god change it back i have a family,0
Very nice app once you have premium (only $10)Easy to use and always has the newest music.,1
Great selection and for the free option not to many adds,1
"App has a few bugs on Fold 3 and Galaxy watch 4. Quite frequently the bezel does not work on GW4, and have to restart the app for volume adjustment to work. Also frequently music is being played from Fold 3 but the spotify app says music is paused. This is just BASIC playback control Spotify, for a premium service this just isn't polished enough.",0
"Great app but atm it's acting up. I can't sample songs before I add them into my playlists anymore so I don't know what I'm adding. I've close the app, uninstalled it and nothing works. It's a real bummer and defeats the purpose of this being a music app if I can't even choose what I listen to.",0
If only spotify was as it was 6 months ago. I cannot stand this. The app keeps deleting my downloaded songs and the app just keeps on crashing from time to time. I just wished that the developers turned the app back as it was. Due to these frequent problems with the mobile and desktop/pc apps I am highly considering transferring to apple music,0
I love that I can make my own playlists and I also enjoy those created for me. Have found some new bands!,1
Not all songs are complete. It is a good app over all,1
When i get updated to new version. I didn't feel comfortable to play music. The old version was so good,0
"3-5 minutes of ads literally every song, maybe every other song if you're lucky. Makes it absolutely unusable for anything but podcasts",0
"So on my iphone 6 I wasn't able to buy Spotify premium, which was a bummer. But I really like it because it has good quality music. I just don't like it when I skip a song that it immediately jumps into and ad. Also that the adds are unskippable can be annoying. But nothing too serious. I like you guys. Keep it up! Also it's nice that you have remixes.",1
"I used to love this app. But recently my favourite song 'Money' by LISA has been replaced by some unauthorised song in many playlists. I have reported and tweeted tagging Spotify too, but they haven't done anything yet to fix it. I'm really irritated by this behaviour of Spotify. I hate how they are not responding or doing anything to fix it and my favourite artist is loosing precious streams because of Spotify's negligence.",0
"This app is not working just fine since this morning. Perhaps there is a technical glitch. When I turn it on trying to play the music the app shuts me out. So, please do fix. Love you spotty!",0
Best music streaming app in Play Store.,0
"CANNOT TURN OFF SHUFFLE PLAY! Nuff said really, only happens to me on Android, PC works fine. The reason I dropped this review all the way to one star is their refusal to fix this problem. I searched Google for a solution but instead found that people have been having this problem for years and they have done NOTHING!",0
l really love spotify ld lovetoo go premion but at the cost of every thing and l am on my own but l cant say how spotify has helped me through covid l was locked in for two years,1
They hold your downloaded songs hostage unless you pay or uninstall the app. They don't even have permission to my files but they found a way into them I guess.,0
"I dont know what the heck is going on but since the most recent update ive only been able to play like 5 songs then it crashes, THEN when opened the you lose the interface to control the music.... Spotify is always a 5 star, but after this update, the stars drop to a 3 and if this continues its gonna be a 1 because i use this app for during my exercise...",0
App is good but there are so many ads for short time,0
Excellent selection; very intuitive when finding music for us based on our own choices; super fast downloads,1
"Latest update has a bug that doesn't show the bar to pause and change songs. Fixed itself after I reinstalled the app, then it started happening again.",0
This app is great uts so easy to use every song I need is in there every remix it's just mind-blowing . I recommend every1 to download it loved it.,1
"Can no longer shuffle albums ðŸ¤” Step backwards, At least give us the option",1
Trash app wouldn't even use if Joe Rogan hadn't moved over. Literally randomly just changed podcasts and pauses for no reason all the time.,0
I love this application........ I'm a complete music head like I need music 24/7. I'm a premium user for past 6 months but the problem is they don't have a proper customer support...... I lost my last account because my phone was rebooted.....my email connected to my account was lostbut still I changed to my new email on Account settings still it did not help...... this is the only reason I'm giving 3 stars. Please please improve and please appoint a proper customer support team other than FAQS.,0
Cant open app always trable,1
"I love spotify, and premium is so worth BUT, the last update doesn't show the song that's currently on at the bottom of the screen while in the app, so can't go to lyrics, or see how far you're through etc. Doesn't make sense?",0
"Love Spotify, it has some really great music.",1
Best music app so far,1
Worst worst worst. I have paid for premium but no premium services are provided even after so many complaints.,0
Amazing! I enjoyed hearing Melanie Martinez's podcasts and music videos here. I LOVE the NEW SPOTIFY UPDATE! ðŸ¥° Go DOWNLOAD SPOTIFY FOR FREE NOW!! (I am not a bot but I just want people to notice Spotify. ðŸ˜…),1
I can't get to choose the songs I want to when I'm picking a band. Spotify always pick the song to listen and that's very frustrating. Very disappointed.,0
"They tricked me very well, they drugged me with so much selections, then they dropped me while i wanted to listen too my choice, then a whole bunch of advertising",0
This app is quick and easy to use if you understand... But this is one of the best music apps I know in my opinion...keep on with the lovely apps ðŸ‘Œ,1
"Spotify is the best music app i've tried, it's really easy to use and has a lot of recommended playlists that spotify makes, and music that you can explore, and the app is easy to use. even if a lot of people say there are a lot of ads and can't play the music they like because of the new update, just pay for spotify it's really cheap and you'll find spotify easier to use when you pay for it. i use spotify everyday from day to night, i thank everyone who built spotify and everyone who manages it",1
Its a good music app I just wish you could click on any song and play it and not have to wait for it to shovel through and there's an extreme amount of adds,1
Hey my music don't play right it doesn't play it doesn't pause but when it does the bar at the bottom doesn't show and the bar on my notifications doesn't disappear and another bar on my notification keeps saying Spotify connections ??!!!!!!!!!!ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜’,0
I enjoy this app alot I love the fact they made free. I do plan on subscribing for premium. And I love how my playlist are so organized don't let me get started on the podcasts.,1
I play the list on my like but it's play random song and I can't skip it bc of the 6 skip per hour it's super suck,1
Great 90% of the time but that 10% is mehhhhhh,0
Have same issue as others... App keeps freezing and crashing. Is there something with the recent updates as the app plays and stops constantly?,0
Who can really fault Spotify? I use the paid version but it's very much worth it.,1
A little clunky at times. Lots of options though,0
It's gud for everyone to get the Spotify app to get more music,0
Best App Ever !!! The Dark Mode is good and easy access to all its features If you would give me to rate it 1 to 10 I would like to give it 11,1
"I don't really like how you can't listen to previews when you press the add songs button ( new update, free version) can you please change it back.",0
"This app makes my day better after a long one, listening to the music is just so easy and accesable. Toatally recomend",0
"Amazing apps loved it somuch we can hear to any music songs using less data, This is one of the great best app I have seenðŸ˜ŠðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµâ¤â¤â¤â¤ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³",1
"It's decent, i mean, it's spotify, you know exactly what you're getting. Just a shame that albums don't play in order on my mobile, yet they do on my consoles. I detest shuffle on albums, it's the worst way to listen to music. It would be 5 stars if it let me listen to albums properly.",0
"I'm ready to switch to Amazon music. Shuffle option is just horrendously bad. I have a playlist with 16 hours of music with shuffle mode for my bike riding (and sorted by title as suggested by a user) but I keep hearing the same songs over and over. I have tried everything including reinstalling but still just horrendous shuffle. I'm going to trial Amazon music now and if better, bye bye Spotify.",0
Nice,1
One of the best app for music!,1
I like this very much because favorite all songs are here . I am giving 5 star ðŸŒŸðŸ˜,1
Nice,1
The best streaming music site '. Nothing compares,1
I don't know what is happening ..i tried to go to my account it started hanging... afterall when I uninstalled it .and installed the app isn't opening..i hope you should do something it's annoying,0
Yeah it's good and all but its maybe just a little annoying when the features are so limited in Spotify free.,0
Best app I've ever spent money on. I wish one of you would contact me. Thanks. Need some help getting out of this place.,1
Best playlist so far! Recommended songs are top tier.,1
"I love Spotify ,it's really â˜ï¸ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ’¯, âœŒï¸ðŸ’“ðŸ™Œ just loved it (app).",1
"Excellent app , I'm using this app very long time but the major problem is going for a long this app is getting too slow day by day",0
"I have no doubt to say that Spotify is the best app for listening songs. But recently I have got one issue relating to it. Whenever I listen music, I don't find the play button in my notification bar. It was useful to quickly stop the music or to change into another. I wish, if this system comes back, I will trust this app with my eyes closed.",0
"Well, the reason I gave it 3 stars is this, Number 1 problem, ads disturb my music and sometimes ruins the mood. Number 2, they put music in few of the Playlists(Daily mixes) some other songs which I do not like. Number 3, in playlists they play the song in shuffle. I nean, what's the point of mobile if laptop is better. I'd rather use Spotify Web player on computer cuz I can actually choose from playlist which song I wanna hear.",0
The app lags like anything. Even on a latest processor. I don't know what the team is doing. I'm pretty sure nobody will even read this.,0
Lyric sharing is unsync at most times that its frustating to even bother with it. Ads takes too long (eta 30+seconds) and it seems it would take longer in the future. Also ads would repeat. Not worth the premium option.,0
Spotify is the best song app to listen song in offline,1
I am just LOVING using Spottify! I have so many choices!,1
Good Quality Sound best online ..but thank you Spotify by free share with friend....,1
Often have to troubleshoot dealing with crashes or the app not playing music or having issues with saved media for offline use.,0
"I used to love Spotify. But now the same issue came up twice. I cannot play some particular songs. Logging out/in isn't helping at all, reinstalling the app helps for a while, but then the issue comes back. Please fix this ASAP. I really want my music back.",0
"Keeps changing the user interface with songs, car mode sucks. Music keeps cutting out. Downloaded items aren't downloaded when trying access them without service.",0
"I think overall the app is fine and I use it often. But I have a few things I would like added, such as the ability to loop on mobile and play just one song without shuffle. Thanks!",1
All the music I love. The best playlists too. What more is there to say.,1
I can't open the app. It's stuck on the start-up screen(or logo screen). I've installed and uninstalled the app a few times already and it still won't budge.,0
I have been trying to install this App and it kept showing me pending for more than 50minutes...but I believe it will get better,0
very impressive app,1
I love this app but the new update is annoying. I know that's on purpose to make us buy premium. Giving us ads is enough. Not allowing us to choose or change the music and making shuffle disabled for us is annoying. I'll still give it a 4/5 cause I've been using this app for years already but I just haven't bought the premium.,0
this app is good but they're too many ad:-\,0
App always freezing had to downgrade,0
Every day Spotify and I find more and more music,1
"Turned 'autoplay similar songs when music ends' off, yet it still does play them.",1
I enjoy Spotify and have been using it for quite a while. My only gripe with it is that when listing to an artists mix I wish they played more of the artist and less of the similar artists.,0
"yall, this app is in a constant state of crashing. Even when my screen is on the song will crash too, PLEASE fix this. the app is falling apart.",0
Superb sound and all my favourites.,1
"Love the library but once you heart a tune they tend to overplay it, reducing experience of other tunes.",0
"Easy to use and navigate. Also easy to turn off when session finishes (some podcast apps linger like foot odor). Also moves onto the next episode automatically, which I like when listening to a series. Ads are not bothersome (unlike some podcast players). Very satisfied with Spotify.",0
Even youtube free version doesn't show so many ads.And the rates for premium membership also is way too high.Horrible application,0
"In one word the app is fantastic. But, I'm giving it four stars because spotify does'nt have the feature of lyrics translation. I mean one can't translate a song's lyrics into any other language. Such as- You can't translate the song ""Raabta""'s lyrics into English from Hindi.",1
"Always ads ads ads ads , ads comeup after almost every song , it was all right before because after an ad there ere no ads until 30 minutes but now its trash",0
i like Spotify .but i want english translation for korean songs.,0
I am totally into Spottify and I love the mini premium of 7 and 25 ....worth this was first.But now app not responding at all tried lal the trouble shoots since I gave trial for free premium it's not working... Don't know whether it's a trick,0
Haven't found something this great in a while I love this app easy and not hard to use.,1
"For the past month, none of my playlists will load. I updated the app, uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone, all to no avail. I've done pretty much all I can think of doing to fix this problem, and nothing has worked. From the other reviews, this is obviously commonplace, therefore it's an issue on Spotify's end, not the customer's. Please fix this app! I've loved using Spotify for the past 2 years, but these new glitches have me considering taking my business elsewhere.",0
It's easy to get music on Spotify,1
"After the update, play in background its not working... The buttons (âªâ–¶â©) and the whole part that we visualize the song and lyrics are completely gone",0
This app is really easy to use. You load your favorite music and your play lists and play them wherever you go.,1
"Spotify is a wonderful app for music and entertainment I would recommend it, you can listen to all your favorite songs you can even make yourself a playlist of all your songs, you can listen to music non stop with Spotify. Take a look, bye and hope you all to have a good day.â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸",1
"Was 5 star but recently the quality of its functionality is terrible..... the app is not working properly. Play,pause, forward buttons not showing when playing from ""liked songs"" and controls don't appear when screen is locked. Music still playing when app is closed ... what is going on?",0
The app is crashing in my gaming phone,0
Adds are fine but cant play previous song shuffle is always on  I cannot play songs in my playlist according to my orderaddin songs to queue is a premium feature Cant skip to a particular portion of the song,1
I love the fact that I can just listen to all my favourite songs whenever I please,1
"I get to listen to the music that i grew up with in the car, st home and out and about. It's great!",1
Doesn't work half the time. Not working with Android Auto. Song cut out at random. Customer support is sadly not very helpful. Also Neil Young is misssing.,0
Too much ads,0
"Absolutely terrible, worst music app ever. I have a friend that likes to share music through Spotify. Every link I click takes me to the correct song, but it doesn't actually play, despite me clicking the play button multiple times. When I do finally get a song to play, I can only shuffle/skip the song about 3 times before it tells me I need premium in order to skip the song again. Really piss poor app, I have to open the song on Spotify and then put it into YouTube to hear ones my friend sends.",0
"Easy to use, great selection",1
Spotify contains a variety of podcasts with great content the programs provide entertainment and information. There is consistently something new and interesting to listen to.,1
Overall great experience. Shuffle feature could be a bit more intuitive. Would be a 5* otherwise.,0
Very nice variety of songs,1
"Worst. There should be an option to turn off how it adds songs automatically that's stupid if I like a song I will add it I don't need you picking stuff for me. And when you go to play a playlist the songs it added are played first it's so annoying! I have tons of other issues with this app as well but that's one of the biggest ones. If my rating could be zero, it would! ðŸ‘Ž",0
Love it. Always easy to find the music you want.,1
"Great app, a few device sync issues and missing lyrics but overall good experience",1
Great music selection and quality. New update won't let me use slider unless it's at the very top of the screen and even then still won't show be any information about where I am on the slider.,0
"Hey, Spotify team! What's going on with the app lately? For the past couple of months I've been experiencing frequent and random disconnects. It's annoying & frustrating...it ruins the whole experience. I am a premium plan subscriber and a huge fan. Please fix this! P.S. It's not the internet connection ( I have 500 Mbps downloading speed). Thanks!",0
It's really a 5 star app just don't want them to get big headed go head get the premium package best 10 you will ever spend,0
I like to listen songs from spotify,1
I love spotify . I paid premium today but I can't log in It says offline As it sends a link It says expired link . Please cooperate. Thank you,0
"It's a very very good application for listening songs, podcasts, etc. I enjoyed very much with it. This is a special music listening application because it give us the freedom to make our own privet or public playlist. It's amazing.",1
Good app but sometimes has issues where I have to delete and reinstall. 126A,0
"Please fix ASAP!!!! ALL the time I'm on the app now, it play 2 songs then turn off... please please fix.",0
Cant listen to more than two songs without 3 ads popping up -_-,0
"They removed the car view, but now I can sing karaoke while driving. Thanks Spotify for caring about my safety!",1
It's really ok and impacting but not all needed are available on Spotify.,1
Is it just mine or this app got too many bugs after update?,0
Doesn't even start after install. Says update your location and fails. Other app detect location with no issues.,0
"Love the content and library available. I've been using it for years but recently it's quite buggy - my song just stop playing after minutes, or the playing bar is missing, which disable me from pausing the song.",0
Continues to crash on my samsung 10. Have to regularly uninstall and reinstall (like ik doing now while I write this review).,0
"Its good, i don't get ads without purchasing the subscription . I've used it for like 5 months its working perfectly. I find all the songs that i want from acroos the world. Keep up the good work :)",1
Sound cheesy but on all honesty This is a great app The price is worth it I have had 0 problems/issues with it Amazing job ! Thank you for bringing us the Joy of Music everywhere we go and even Offline !,1
Exceptional,1
My favorite entertainment for my ears.,1
One of the best apps for listening to your favorite song's and podcasts!,1
Nice ðŸ‘ app; but you can't download the online music,0
Works great. Currently have no issues.,1
"The app's great! Just like I heard it. Infact, it had almost all the musics and podcasts I just needed.. All I had an issue with is this - When a playing song ends, the 'notification' for the song disappears and the next song doesn't play.. I've recently updated Spotify but it doesn't work, I manually need to change the song each time one ends (Which gets annoying when we are gaming or being on Social medias). Please fix this.",0
App gets worse with every update. Crashes and pauses constantly now. SO glad that we decided to upgrade to Duo...NOT AT ALL.,0
Nice app,1
The is best as I can say. But we cannot rearrange the songs in playlist made by us. So please give us that option to rearrange the songs in our playlist. Otherwise it is best.,1
"I love music, I love spotify ðŸ˜.",1
Doesn't work well past few days... it doesn't open panel with play pause and switch song button.... whenever I eant to switch the music off I have to restart my phone otherwise kt doesn't stop.... and music keep stopping for seconds....tried to uninstall and install again but nothing works,0
New update is horrible. Not being able to pick which song and my playlist constantly shuffling. I recommend SoundCloud or YouTube Music.,0
Very happy with Spotify's music.,1
Easy and comfortable  good app,1
"Cool I love listening to music ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ it's a cool app I don't have that much problems so it's a great appðŸ‘ðŸ˜ the problem is that it needs internet so yeah,it needs internet to work but that doesn't bother me that much so it's a great appðŸ‘ðŸ˜â¤ï¸",1
"Amazing app! I definitely recommend it! Although there are lots of ads, u will find every single song here!",1
Well I can't listen to a song I want to listen to because it adds other songs to it then I can't listen to the song I want to listen to.,1
Excellent platform with endless music to explore. An awesome feel good app.ðŸ˜·ðŸŒðŸ‘â¤.,1
"Nice app, I love the track selection even without giving instruction on what to play!",1
A good music experience i would recommend this app surely though sometimes it gets glitchy while running in background!,1
"Music lover, and trying to add some songs to my alarms! â°",0
"Love everything about Spotify. Full songs, no frequent ads, can leave the site. Fantastic!",1
"I love listening songðŸŽ§ This app is soooooooooo perfect I am from West Bengal I listen hindi , English, Bengali, arabaic all songs",1
"I love the sound quality, besides my playlists, Spotify suggests great new ones and searching for artists or songs is really easy. The searched song becomes a seed for similar songs. I love it!",1
I love this app i use it every day and its so easy and hanfull,1
"I mean, I get premium for 10$ so I'm happy. I wouldnt want to pay more though",0
Spotify is a great music app with almost every type of music you can think of n there are no unecessary ads popping up every 2 seconds it has been a great experience using this app.,1
Can we figure a way this app doesnt take up so much storage?,0
"It won't play what the graphic shows, or what the link was for. I wanted to hear Lion Heart by May Erelywine. After several attempts, I went to YouTube, so much better.",0
Where are the controls? Have had to uninstall to switch off.,0
Love it...I install many music apps but u are the best in all of them...,1
It's gets stuck always when I open Spotify I need to close and open the Spotify why,0
"Keep losing the playing now tab on the button, have to close app and restart. Songs will cut out for a second then resume, sometimes won't connect with Android auto. These are new issues. These need to be fixed quickly. I'm not paying for a broken app....",0
"Great app, multiple features which make music more listeninable and accessible.",1
"Great app!! Use it on Harley Uiltra with"" My Playlist"" for what I want to hear!!",1
No need to test other apps for phone to listen to podcast,1
Shittiest app for listening to music. It shows ads after every single song i play and not just one sometimes it displays 2-3 ads simultaneously.....,0
Keep up the awesome work! ðŸ˜âœŒï¸ðŸ’š,1
"Okay so I originally gave two stars but am revising my rating. In addition to the absolute CRAPLOAD of shady ads which interrupt after every song, the app is INCREDIBLY SLOW and laggy. I repeat. INCREDIBLY slow. My device is running Android 12 and is PERFECTLY capable of running the app well, if only it would function properly. Playlists take *minutes* to load. Its very frustrating when you sit down to listen to some music at the end of the day and you've to deal with this nonsense.",0
These is just really good that I don't even have words for it,1
Good. It just need better sound quality,0
there were few pauses while listening to music.,0
bad apps..very complicated to re-subscribe monthly payment and always error..,0
Best app to stream music!,1
Horrible playback hardly works when you want it Spotify needs to pick up the game and actually fix their problems,0
Spotify is a great music steaming service the only thing I dont't like are the ads but they have to make money somehow,0
When all the other apps are running perfectly over my wifi or cellular data but this app says there's no internet connection and cannot search anything but the home page is working fine and I am able to listen songs from there. So for that reason I uninstalled the app and installed it again but now unable to login it is something went wrong try again and buffering continuously. It was my fav app but i don't know what happened to this.,1
"Have loved this app for years but all of a sudden, volume drops almost in half about every 10 minutes. Cannot figure out why. Will cancel premium unless fixed. So annoying and please help!",0
The app has a problem connecting to wifi or the data and the support wasn't helpful at all,0
"I already wrote a review idk where it went but im so frustrated rn bc the app keeps skipping songs about 30 seconds in. Idk if this is a stupid setting I have enabled but Spotify is unusable like this. It randomly plays things, starts over songs, skips songs, and just jumps to random parts of a song. So frustrated. Edit: I think I got hacked from connecting my Spotify to other apps. Logged out of all devices and denied permissions and it seems to be fixed.",0
Why can't repeat and suffle the song!! I hope it is fixed as soon as possible,0
"Such a wonderful app, but it contains adds after each song. This is the only demerit in this app. Other features are awesome.",1
Play control buttons keep disapearing,0
"When I installed Spotify at first, it was an amazing app with great features. 2 weeks later I now cannot disable shuffle and I no longer have a choice of what song I'm playing. Wouldn't install this app unless you want to waste Â£10 a month on a premium subscription.",0
When I press on a playlist it starts playing a suggested song even when I turned off autoplay. I made more playlists to switch because of the suggested songs. Now when I click on any of the playlists it starts playing a random song. I am very frusted with this and don't like this feature.,0
Although the app is great I don't like it when it plays suggested freaking songs I don't want to listen to insted of my favorite song plus i can't loop no more because i did not want to the other songs that I did not want to listen to.,0
Really the best app for listening to music . Totally enjoy my playlists where the songs are picked for me.The plans are somewhat feels satisfying .The UI is so simplistic and usually there are no or close to very few ads in this app,1
"used to be good, now i can't preview songs or block people when I used to be able to",0
it was all good till I purchased my airpods it started slowing down.... pausing in between with no reason but before that it was good...and the airpods are not the issue,0
I am using Spotify to listen to a podcast to learn Spanish. A Zero to A Hero by Babbel. It is great.,1
I feel Spotify has a better music selection then most other radio companies ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ðŸ¼,0
Excellent app for listening and creating play lists. Too bad they (Spotify) screw the artists over by paying them next to nothing for their music and hard work. Corporations; money over ethics.,0
best music app out there but the last few updates have rendered my liked downloaded songs to take forever to load while offline. It shouldn't have to load... it's downloaded offline songs.,1
Fun enjoyable ,1
"Seems like Spotify wants to be a little b****, if that's the case, I hope you lose a lot of people off Spotify.",0
"Absolutely amazing ,i enjoy using this app .Its easy to use ðŸ˜˜",1
Premium option is the best. Especially if you're like me from the older generation.,1
Other update was better. Because you can pick your own songs an not have to wait an hour to play just 6 songs. Adds suck too.,0
I would give 5 stars be abuse Spotify is a necessity in my daily life. I have been having app issues. It doesn't want to work properly. It will stop at least once and hour. Just like pause and I have to hit play again. Or it won't allow me to see the current song playing. I have reinstalled it a couple times. I hope it gets fixed soon because it is super annoying.,0
I got really good music I got a really good library of some really good sounds really good artist I'm good with it,1
"Why do you keep saying I'm offline when I'm clearly connected to strong wifi and data networks??? Switching between playing music and podcasts is also problematic. But the worst part: why do I still hear ads while playing podcasts when I'm paying for a premium membership??? I understand when podcasts do their in-program ad read, but why am I hearing ads about Canadian Tire from US based podcasts that clearly sounds like it was inserted by Spotify???",0
Overall it's a good app but the new update doesn't let you skip parts of the songs wich would be fine but i sometimes want to backtrack on songs that i have played before and when you play playlist it goes back to the song you were at and it also goes back on the same timestamp wich sucks when playing a different playlist and then returning to the other one and one last thing you can't start on wich song you want on your liked playlist. Fix these problems,0
Love this app all kinds of diverse ðŸŽ¶ I love to hear.,1
"it's a wonderful music app, and i definitely recommend. however, one issue i have is the imbalance between the different platforms. pc, almost everything you want from the app besides ""no ads"". tablet, quality is kinda the same on PC, but different because it's a tablet. phone, god, it needs to improve. ads, sure whatever, i get it. but not being able to choose what song to listen to and only 6 skips an hour? what if someone can't afford a tablet or PC? rethink this, because it's stupidly unfair",0
Spotify is good especially with kids songs,1
Worst user Interface. They pay out millions but apparently don't pay their programmers enough to make the user Interface Intuitive. Garbage. Spent 5 minutes trying to figure out how to go back to an audiobook on spotify. If it's not possible without premium say so. Garbage. I'll stick with YouTube and their evil overlords,0
Very interesting app for music lovers,1
I like this game because it's it's always plays your favorite music and I just love it,1
"It used to be great and I loved it but not anymore, it got too bad, like when i choose an music it open an other one, what is this pls !!",0
One of my absolute favorite apps. The songs collection is really vast and the UI is very clean and minimal. The crossfade feature is amazing. So is the ability to control playback from any device.,1
I have used the Spotify app for many years now and I enjoy the price as well as the selection of music and podcasts!,1
"Never had any problems. I like all features, reasonable costs for subcriptions (better than other subscriptions) i enjoy this app and its my go to for music! And if it doesnt work for you its your device not the app because it works fine for me.",1
The best I've ever experienced.. Kudos to the software team ðŸ™‚,1
"The latest update has broken a ton of things, The player disolays the wrong song and you can't even skip or pause.",0
It's good but you have to pay money for the songs to go offline on phone so please change that and remove the only 6 skips. There should be as many skips as we want,0
Great catalog and great features. Always striving to improve.,1
"Excellent app. Its algorythm matching to you're preferences is amazing. Honestly if you want to avoid interuptions just purchase the premium app. UPDATE 1/18/22: No longer worth 5 stars. You guys just lost a premium customers. Because your developers could be outdone by highschoolers. Higher new ones or your gonna keep losing them. This App crashes everytime i attempt to play a song. Now it crashes and forces closes. Read reviews, I'm not the only person experiencing your screw up devolopers.",0
It stops playing randomly and doesn't remember where is left off. Really annoying,0
"Has been great, hate to say that too early though...",0
Great listening experience.,1
The best and quality music provider please download now,1
Painful. Spotify started to download 15gb of songs to my internal card when they were already on my sd card. Spotify forgot where to store them. Edit:. Just downloaded them all again today. When they are already on external card. Spotify now slow to open.,0
"Best music app you can download! Has every single song/artist you like listening to, different mixes depending on your mood, and podcasts to listen to if you're not in a music mood! If I could I would give this app 10 stars, that's how amazing it is!",1
"Im getting really tired of it getting glitched out on me and constantly having to Uninstall and reinstall it especially when I pay for premium every month. Like come on. Do better. and NOW it's not even loading. it won't let me in. I unstalled and installed twice and still, nothing.",0
"music stops few seconds and restart, sometimes the app just stops completely. Annoying when you re running. Anyone recommend another music streaming app much better?",0
"Used to be my go to music app. Most of the time I try to play music, I'll click a song and it'll play but will not show me the header of the song so I have no way to pause rewind or any other controls to the song. I have to either close the app or turn the volume complete off for the music to ""stop"" Extremely frustrating during podcasts because I'm constantly missing parts of it because I can't pause it. If this gets fixed I'll use spotify more but until then I'll live with ads on YouTube.",0
It's a great app. I'm a Premium subscriber however after the last update my Samsung will not play anything. I'm not happy about paying for something I can't use!,0
It's a bit rather a lot buggy tbh so 3 stars or else would have given it 5 stars... ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ But please fix this or else it will be a very bad experience for the users like us,0
Amazing experience. All tyoes of songs available. Love it...,1
"Theme and browse features arent exactly tuned for my taste while AI selection is way better than competition. The selection though has either went way downhill or the AI here is starting to slip some. The freemium vs paid i feel needs better tuning. I did eventually subscribe, but hate the family plans. I also used my PS4 initially to start spotify. Meaning my entire built list was news to me on other platforms that i needed a paid account to use the any song feature. That isnt happy experiences",0
The horror show by khooni monday is the best podcast of this app and also the app is ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚,1
"Worst Music App I have ever used in my life. I think, here I listen more ads than music. They give ads after each and every single song that too three back to back ads. People gets frustrated. It doesn't even deserve 1 Star â­.",0
Very comfortable and easy to manage,1
This app is optimized horrendously. Restarting the app because it just doesn't load anything is common. Works better on newer devices but still seems to get bogged down over time.,0
good for everything apart from remixes what I have to listen to on youtube,1
"It is a good app that i use multiple times a day but after every song i get an ad, i am never allowed to skip any songs and despite what i changed in settings every second song is completely random.",0
Yall have translated lyrics integrated with the song's normal lyrics now. Helps in singing with feelings. Saw it on Dos oruguitas. Yall are winning and I'M here for it! Really excited to see what more you guys will bring to the table! Keep going!,1
"I use to like spotify until this new update, whatever this new update is it stoped me from picking the song i wanted to listen to because spitify ruined my playlist. It now shows a preview of the song i want to listen to and they removed the queue for songs. The only way i can use my playlist now is if i connect to my console or tv.",0
smoothly find out all my favourite music,1
I love it it has so many songs to choose from and its random even on your playlist I love it if recommend using it,1
I loved it ðŸ˜ to hear songs and sound quality ðŸ‘Œ excellent,1
Its such best app for listening songs and we can listen also BTS songs its good,1
From last few days it is showing there is no internet connection but if there is no internet connection then how come i able to songs from the playlists?? Why After trying reinstalling I'm not able to login,0
Rubbish. They make it as hard as possible to navigate to the song that you want. Random songs come up and lots of adverts if you try to switch. Avoid!,0
"Everything is bearable exept one problem. I don't know what's wrong with this app, it faces a lot of connectivity issues. Never gets connected and you can't search songs even when other apps are working with full speed. Tried troubleshooting. Didn't help.",0
"Im very happy with apotify,thank you so much 5 stars",1
"Hello there's a problem with songs from compilation albums added in playlists, i don't know why spotify keeps playing the wrong version (even if it's not added ) please fix this bug asap, i'm paying for this service duh",0
Recent update stopped phone connectivity with my pioneer car stereo. Hopefully future update fixes this.,0
I love it because I can hear different music,1
User friendly and recomends great personalised mixes. I do feel that there should be an option to donate to musicians on free music platforms,1
Can't rate each episode. App keeps crashing after listening for several minutes.,0
What's going on with Spotify lately it doesn't connect back to my car like it should. I can't change music I have to close all the way out and get back in. It's been messing up a lot.,0
It's been buggy recently. It won't show recently played music or podcasts. It also stops and starts playback by itself.,0
"Used to be great, but have since added multiple annoying ""features"" such as ""we added"" and removing the loop buttons. These changes are clearly meant to coax the listener into paying for premium â˜¹",0
The only downside w Spotify is that you get pigeon holed by the algorithm & it's difficult to find new music,0
"4* due to ads, otherwise it is 5*",0
"Everything was going good until the frikin update, when I play a song it plays a different song, even if it was a single song, so fix the update right now bro.",0
"Unable to connect app to facebook, even after clickinv on fond friend & connecting to facebook. Again keep asking to connect Facebook.",0
The best music streaming site there is!,1
Very good app for listening music good quality,1
Internet login in Spotify and songs are not playing in my phone,0
I can listen to my song with out and problems love this app,1
I like the playlists and options to download for offline uses,1
Need more skips. I might just uninstall it. 6 is not enough.,0
"I've been using Spotify for around 7-8 years now, it's where I listen to music everyday since :)",1
"Very practical,it's much better than YouTube in a way that you can listen to your music in your car even when your phone is locked ðŸ˜„ ðŸ¤£ ðŸ˜‚",1
"The bar on the bottom of the android app, where you pause/play a song, keeps disappearing. Hence, no way to stop the app from playing. Fingers crossed it'll soon be fixed :)",0
"It's awesome experience,it is on point when it comes to fresh music ðŸŽ¶ no hustle just a ticky of a button",1
"ads can be repetitive, but i get it. gotta get the revenue somehow. not a big fan of the shuffle-only play option on standard accounts or the app automatically adding songs to playlists that aren't long enough, but it's got a crazy selection of music and i like the focus on playlists.",1
The shuffle could work better sometimes I hear the same song Within the hour,0
I've had this app for years and years. It was good when I first installed it and now it's even better and reliable. I totally recommend this app.,1
Get rid of your added song to my playlist and do not need your recommended songs either. Not a very good experience.,0
Its ok,1
The whole package is great. I would recommend this app to everyone,1
get like Pandora nd let them watch one video and they get to pick any song instead of payin for premium just to listen to what we want.,0
"Recent update causes the playback to dissappear(only resolved by closing the app out completely) and the songs will stop playing by itself randomly, unless I have my headphones connected.",0
"Premium area, all Artists, Podcast, My Playlists and everything is there. There is no option for removing them but there is option for separating please fix that!",0
"Terrible for podcasts, randomly skips episodes when ads come up.",0
"One of the best music apps I've used, virtually any song you could imagine is here and hardly any adds, I don't pay for the app but I feel like I get paid users benefits. I tell people all the time to switch to Spotify y'all are great keep up the good work",1
My app plays songs that sound like a scratched cd. I Uninstalled it and reinstalled it and restarted my phone still same problem.,0
Atleast you can make a playlist unlike Pandora. My app often just stops working including in the middle of my music. I am forced to enter the app again. By that time it will start playing the same songs I just heard before it crashed. I had it get cought in a loop of the same 12 songs for a Week. It seems re-use the same songs over and over again. I have 37 hours worth of song and it seems like the same music plays before going to something you haven't heard in weeks.,0
Always right on top with the music I love thank you Spotify,1
Very Very nice spotify music namaste India,1
Update has been awful buggy mess. Can control my music half of the time.,0
What ever you guys did with the recent updates has changed the app for the worse. Feels like half the time I'm fighting for the app to work.,0
"Great, but premium is pricy",1
"I hate the new update, Earlier before I can shuffle my playlist everytime and then this new update came in... I really hate it. You need a premium just to shuffle a music???",0
I love Spotify because and listen to any song I want when I want.,1
Great music selection and very easy to navigate,1
My experience with spotify was excellent..... This app helped me in difficult time ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
"I love it, sample and easy to use but sometime you should pay to get a nice service.",0
"The AI of app is amazing, it allways suprise me with a new perfect suggestion of a band or songs which I never heard.",1
Would be nice if the app stopped closing in the middle of a song.,0
"An unprecedented experience,smooth animationsðŸ’¯",1
Very usefull for relaxing all favorite songs.,1
"When it works, it's great. Most days it will only play 2-3 songs completely, then the first 10s of everything else.",0
"Same review as a the one that was left by a user on April 11 2022. Since you have introduced a new feature about recognizing bluetooth devices, the Spotify app keeps crashing: the music reader does not show anymore when music is being played, the music stops every 10 minutes. Right now I am pressing a tune and the music is not playing at all! I have restarted my phone multiple times, uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Please fix your bugs!",0
Good app but we can't listen it without internet,1
"Poor application with potential , the ads after every song ruin it , on top of the add they waste another 15 seconds telling us that they're giving us 30 minutes of listening ad free .",0
"Used to be a 5/5 but barely works anymore. Keeps crashing, the play/pause button never shows up so you can't stop your music or skip a song,",0
Easy to use. I could find all my favorite music. I play my music all the time with no limitations.,1
Easy to find artist and music,1
Spotify is a great app you get to listen to your different songs it got a lot of songs around the world your favorite songs too get it ðŸ˜,1
Doing well,1
Its a great app I could listen any song I wanted its really amazing but the only problem is the add you will have to listen adds more than songs its horrible please do something about that add,0
"Not good at hall, hardly very few things are available as per the content, inspite taking the membership also we don't get proper service from the new version of this app",0
Great discovery All my favorite tunes listened at leisure. Doesn't seem to be available offline though. Tried downloading but files not found saved anywhere.,1
I love this app .. Its one of the best music apps ever .. I would highly recommend this app to any music lover like me .. Thanks spotify .. Your the best :),1
"Love Spotify, but there are some bugs that need to be fixed asap. For instance music will be playing, but will not show on my phone(it'll say Spotify is trying to play...), when on the app, or across the bottom of the Spotify screen and therefore it will not cast on my car's screen. I have to shut the whole thing down and open back up which is not great to do while living in a ""hands-free"" state. Also my liked songs regularly disappear. The platform should be able to keep up",0
Considered as one of the most top leading apps on music Spotify never failed to satisfy my daily cravings for music It matches my moods when im driving,1
Sadly you have to pay but when you do it's amazing.,1
"I love spotify but the app is no longer great. It randomly stops playing. Skips. Player controls disappear. It's as if the music or podcasts are ghost playing. I'll get messages on my phone saying spotify is trying to play while it's playing. But there are no contols in the app so that i can do anything. I have to restart my phone, it works fine foe a minute, but starts with these weird problems all over again. Please fix these issues developer.",0
The app continues to randomly shut off on me for no reason on all of my devices. I play my music for 1 or 2 songs and it closes. I open it again and it does the same. Otherwise I do enjoy it and the ability to find almost anything i enjoy.,0
Excellent,1
"Spotif is indeed the best, i play all my music on this app, it's really enjoyable, no ads disturbing the music, it's really quite interesting",1
Pls this app always shows network problem or error and if i check other apps like youtube it will run in 780p but why is there any problem. And i think its best to fix this because im a premium user so pls,0
Is there a negative star for apps? Today I would have given negative 5 for spotify. I forgot my password and there was no support to login. After this review I am uninstall. Disappointing!,0
I love Spotify... The music is endless! The playlists they offer are excellent or make your own..... I have a library of both!!,0
Thumbs up for this app! Easily download any songs that I want and it's good for sharing.,1
"Lately, I've been using Spotify as my main music app, but I am raged by the fact they removed the ability to replay a single song. Now it replays the entire album. I would highly appreciate that you revert the changes. Thanks!",0
Paying for premium..can't access my download song without data fix this please,0
My Spotify keeps stopping and I have to keep reinstalling the app,0
Remove the premium. Please remove the premium for those who can't afford it and hate the ads and the fact that we can't play any song we want without the shuffle in our playlist. Please. Remove. The. Premium.,0
"This is so cool but audio quality is not upto the mark, I am having premium plan and also I select only high resolution for streaming music. Request to spotify team please consider some change in quality",0
"I'm giving this two stars for no other reason that Spotify intentionally screws over desktop users by denying them important features which are ONLY on the app. Why can't I block artists on desktop? Why force me to use the app? I'd use it anyway, but making me HAVE to is just kinda butts.",0
Such and amazing app I love itâ¤ï¸ literally being used every day.,1
I don't ever have any issues listening. I specially love the addition of lyrics.,1
Play bar disappearing so I can't pause or skip anything. Then sometimes the audio would stop then play again.,0
Wish I could listen to the songs in my liked songs playlist without having other songs that aren't in the playlist,1
Created an awesome playlist but the app doesn't play them. Instead I get random songs of the same genre. It's ridiculous. Turned off autopay and I get the same thing. So frustrating. DELETING THIS RUBBISH,0
"a new updaye and same issue as below. last time I had to contact support to fix it. used to love it. a few weeks ago after an update, I stopped seeing a notification in my pull down menu. The app is also switching to playing on the phone after I turned the car off post Bluetooth. Neither of these were ever an issue, I changed nothing about my phone setup.",0
"If Spotify had some Agony Column, it would be darn near perfect. Love it!",1
"This is TERRIBLE! Literally cannot choose the song I want, I have to shuffle and when I want a particular song it tells me"" do you want to add this song to your playlist?"" Fix this trash",0
"The app is good, has nice musuc but it plays songs that aren't on my playlist so -1 star. Otherwise this app is good in general.",1
It has been pausing. What's wrong with it? I can not enjoy my music.,0
Capitalist bs update now I cant play my songs invidually ./.,0
Sometimes works but not allways and you can't just play one song I would recommend Pandora but I am willing to get Spotify premium to make it better so in the next couple of days I will get premium,1
The new layout from 16th of may 22 is just abysmal,0
The best free music and podcast app I've ever used,1
"Great for listening, exploring, and finding new and forgotten music. Everything is always right here at my fingertips.",1
"Some downloads have been deleting themselves seemingly at random since the last update, and I can no longer dismiss the playback notification when I pause/stop without unpinning and closing the app. Now music is playing when app is not open, and randomly dropping volume by like 25%",0
"Somehow the app has been really bad lately. Not sure what they did to the new update but it's not good. Music randomly stops, unable to use properly with Bluetooth, and the songs would stop midway like it's buffering even though you have it downloaded.",0
Good app for music but sometimes it adds also entertains us and premium prices are approximately equal to any ott app so please reduce the premium rate .,0
Great experience I have been using this app recently alot It's great But sometimes the song I play doesn't play alot of issues have occurred I would recommend u to download but you network quality should be good ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
Best music app I love that you could go to any app while playing music,1
Great experience with the app every music and artist is available for your liking,1
"Good app. Sometimes it struggles to find the music I would like to listen. However, I use it daily for at least 9hrs a day.",1
"I can't change the play order from shuffle to in order when listening to an album. This is a seriously deficient app. Take a lesson from Garmin, the most user friendly company in the world, and no I do t work for them.",0
2-3 Ads after 1 song. Not paying for premium because I barely use it.,0
"Epic, Although I hate having to turn on Private session every time, I share my playlists by request, not having every tune show up in Friends notifications on FB.",0
Premium is the only way to go.,0
"Best music app, has adds without premium but their hecka short!!! I get to listen to my video game soundtracks while doing other things, heck, I'm listening to Spotify while writing this review!!!!",1
"Horrible user interface. Getting the song you want to play, to actually play, can take half an hour.",0
I have no lyrics at all songs,0
BETTER,1
I like it cool ,1
"I'm using this app for many years now and it has become one of my most used services ever. Nothing gets close to Spotify's convinience and ease of use. I couldn't live without it anymore. I espacially love the huge library of music. No other service gets close to that. And the discoverability of new music on Spotify is unmatched, too. But pls, work on the following! Pls, -fix Spotify rewind (didn't run on my old device) -release spotify HIFI in the EU! (I need high res badly) Thank you! :)",1
Unable to subscribe. Tech support unable to help.,0
"Always using this app, have done for years it's great!",1
"I genuinely like Spotify however, I don't think you should have to pay for premium as you get money from the ads",0
Everything went fine again after that horrible update from early-April. All files downloaded for offline playing now works fine.,1
"So far, it's been a wonderful experience exploring several genres of music of my choice. Impressive!",1
"Randomly pauses or crashes all the time, even with a downloaded playlist ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸",0
"Can you stop shaming people for not taking your premium? I am fine with ads in general, but your toxic and obnoxious advertising collection is something else.",0
App doesn't stop playing and there is no way to turn it off!,0
"Good app, but you have to pay to preview songs when making a playlist now.",0
Spotify spends 100 million for covid misinformation and racism on their platform but doesn't pay musicians anywhere near adequately. Still waiting on HiFi! Push and pull for me to move to Tidal! Huge unusable lag before playing any song tapped on in liked or when trying to play over Spotify Connect. Can't maintain a private session. No easy option to switch an existing account from Facebook sign in to Spotify sign in. Lyrics feature didn't appear until support manually fixed it for my account.,0
I use this app everyday. Music is either in my ears on way to work or playing through Alexa! Such an easy app to use & has everything I look for music wise.,1
"Spotify is great! When ads aren't popping up after every two songs. I will listen to a song, get an ad afterwards, listen to a song, and then get ads after that song even when it says it will give me 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening. It's a lie and it ruins the entire experience.",0
It's really a good app.... ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ ðŸ˜€ I love it ðŸ˜Šwhen I'm bored then I listen the songs on spotify for my mind fresh...nd the songs make me relax..ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€,1
I love this app,1
Can't use my Bluetooth headset to watch podcasts as it thinks I'm in the car,0
All types of songs are available here and no stopper and all. Love it.,1
Love everything in this appBest app ever for music,1
it's nice and all but sometimes it's laggy.but still it's fun to listen to my favourite songs :)),1
"For the most part I love spotify, on the other side of things every two or so months, when I play a podcast, and normally the visual of the spotify player shows up on my notifications, on one of my home screens, even on my lock screen. BUT every two or so months I will be listening to a podcast and it will stop for no reason. Then when I go to restart it, my visual spotify player does not show up on aby of the areas. Which stops me being able to rewind it when I want. There more but no room.",0
"The possibility to play on a mobile device or a pc is the reason for having the app, but the interface differences between the devices have been sometimes confusing. The total would othewise be most likely 4/5, but after encountering a bug I realized their main method of ""technical support"" is community forum, which is not a decent way of handling problems. In my instance, the bug (metadata on bt devices) has now affected some users for nearly a year with no input from the corporation.",0
I love it because it has no adsðŸ’—ðŸ’—,1
It deserves a 0 for being anti free speech. It only allows communist Democrat podcasts pushing constant propaganda. It has become pathetic.,0
I love this app. It has so many genres to pick from. So many songs to chose and you can follow your friends and listen to there playlist. I like how for instance Salish Matter isn't like Drake but you can still listen to her music. â¤,1
Very good companion. Great app. No issues encountered. Keep up with the good work ðŸ‘ ðŸ™Œ ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘Œ,1

"Absolutely infuriated. I've had to flat delete and reinstall this bumbling Piece Of Software 4 times in the last week. All because it randomly decides, despite my premium account, that it's going to ignore my queue, refuse to give me access to said queue, and lock me into whatever TF they've decided I get to listen to. While midtrack or podcast. I get occasional software glitches, sure. But locking me out, while saying I'm in my premium account, and denying me basic functions? Ridiculous.",0
"a really good app. one of the best music player app. but sometimes it skips and pauses by itself. i don't really know why, but that makes me uncomfortable.",0
"Easy to use across devices, seamlessly. I'm able to download my favourite music and use offline, especially because of intermittent Internet connection in my location.",1
Just the way I want a music app. Switched from YouTube Music.,0
"Before the update, the app was excellent. The only problem I had was the fact that whenever you go online, all my downloads had to re-download. But I got I listened to it offline. Now I have to stay online to listen to my downloads.",0
Thank you for adding the heart feature on the lock screen! Now when I'm driving I can heart songs I like so I don't lose them! 10 points for you!,1
The best music me personally I love ASHNIKKO and she's like soooooooo pretty ðŸ˜,1
"Since the last update the app has not worked, I go to my liked songs and it says try again and anytime I go to a Playlist it says this Playlist is empty. It won't play any songs. Before the update it was working ok aside from it pausing for no reason.",0
"Delete the concept of suggested songs, if we wanted them, they'd be in the playlist already",0
"If u want to see ads and ads with some music in between, go for itðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£",0
Stop the auto pay on connecting to bluetooth.,0
It was fine until the most recent update. Now it's slow and won't let me listen offline unless I manually switch off my data and change the in app settings.,0
"I love it beos there are international songs koren,English 5 â­",1
horrendous amount of adds and most features are paywalled,0
This app is amazing whenever i doing my work i search any of my favourite songs ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³,1
"The app is very good, however measures should be taken about data and bandwidth consumption and the hours it is downloading.",1
Love Spotify! I get to play the music I enjoy!,1
"Music Freedom on Spotify. If you don't like it here, then leave.",1
Can't see that story kinda thing on artists profile eventho we have premium accs. It seems it's the same for the most sri lankan users! Do something about it!,0
"ðŸ™ŒðŸ½ðŸ™ŒðŸ½ðŸ™ŒðŸ½ðŸ™ŒðŸ½. It is relatively less costly, gives you lyrics, consumes less data, and the app has classic graphics. It is actually the best music streaming app. Thank you Spotify.",1
"Lying about Offline Mode for Pro Subscribers. UNRELIABLE. I've found that unless you are actively keeping this app updated, offline mode for downloaded music and podcasts will not work. I've had multiple times where I would be on a flight or a multi hour drive through no cell service and find Spotify unusable despite having my playlists downloaded. It doesn't help that Spotify releases useless, spammy updates every other day. If this issue isnt fixed, I'm canceling. Stop punishing your pro user",0
"This was an extorinary music app. The biggest thing is whatever we like the song we can like and put it easly in playlist. So, I think is the best app to listening music ðŸ˜ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶",1
"Really good selection and the ads aren't that bad , I actually get a lot of candy ads n and up buying reese's lol ! I'm enjoying using it at home outside doing yardwork, keep carrying Joe Rogan, and small artists like The Sober Junkie And Whiteloaf .",1
"Started off well, could listen to songs and skip songs if I wasn't wanting to listen to that one that day. Then suddenly cannot skip songs. By all means have adverts but allow songs to be skipped. Songs have emotional connections and some days you're not ready for certain songs. I think I will have to delete",0
My favouraite songs ellame ketka mudiyuthu,1
FIX THE SHUFFLE also pretty good there a bit to many ads though. E,1
"Love it to death. The ads are a bit annoying but alright, I just mute when ads come up",0
"I've been using this app for so long and haven't encountered any issue until the latest updates. I can no longer see the lyruc feature, the songs plays a differenr song randomly on it's own. Please fix this.",0
Good keep it up guys who ever is working hard for this potentially âœŒï¸ðŸ™ðŸ«,1
"On my s21 ultra many time frozen app, sometimes playing one song but on the bottom showing completely different song, time to time song byself stopped and sfter few seconds start again....thinking to cancel membership",0
"I want it to stop the stupid song but I can't otherwise it is good, just can't see the stop thing.",0
I will not give a single star to this app it is not worth it whenever you download it it stops running after few days. This is every time of this app. Sometimes it hangs. Sometimes it asks to update again and again.Now how many times should I update this app? May give this app one star because my review was not getting posted.,0
"Best app ever, premium is cheap and ads aren't as bad. Free music always, you can play it even when your device is off! Did I mention that if you're in the app while watching an ad, you get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening?! Soo easy to search up your favorite songs and find new ones! Playlists are easy to make to! This is truly the best app for listening to music",1
"You can never close this app on Android, which takes away battery life. Other than that, the app is solid.",1
Best subscription I pay for. I joined because of Joe Rogan but have stayed to listen to what everyone is saying. Thank you for backing freedom of speech.,1
LOVE â¤ï¸ my ONLY app for music and podcasts!,1
Wish you can select more then one song and add it to a Playlist but other then that its pretty good,1
Why does yall's app not know how to work with an sd card. It won't even open. It stays on the same dumb gray screen for idk how long. Fix yalls app i MIGHT download it again.,0
Better songs recommendations than any other app,1
"only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of how frequent ads play, other than that, it's a lot easier to access music",0
"Horrible app when I try to play any song it plays a different song, artists, and genre it sucks",0
"Not good at all.. too much ads, Wynk is anytime better. And also u can't slide it away from the notification bar once u stop listening to it. Updates are bad as well.",0
"What's going on with the app? It's playing but I can't skip the song, or see whats playing on my Playlist. And just randomly stops all together.",0
"Disappointing lately. Play, pause and stop bar keeps disappearing. Continues to play on phone when turn off car with no way to turn off other than turn off the phone, music drops repeatedly, can't skip tracks when linked to car stereo and doesn't show track playing. Updated in app store two days ago and all was well until today and its started doing it again. Spotify contacted by email.",1
"u love spotify because Jungkook, V and BTS' songs is there.",1
"Play button constantly disappears, music doesn't stop when disconnected from Bluetooth, music pauses randomly",0
I rate 1 star because there are too much of ads I know u want us to buy premium but there are too much of ads it annoys me that's why I am rating only 1 star,0
How to enable sing feature on Spotify?,1
Great application to listen to music from. The best actually,1
App keeps not showing the song or podcast (time line with the skip back and forth icons),0
"So many issues at the moment, won't connect to car properly, won't show what I'm playing have to close app for the app to work, if this continues I'll be leaving Spotify at the end of the month",0
I dont have the canvas feature in my spotify even after uninstalling and reinstalling it. I want that feature. How can I get that?,0
"Video randomly stops working. ""Playback failed"" message constantly. Work out your bugs so i can enjoy my podcasts and i will rate this app higher.",1
"Not happy with the new update and look -Update- They've significantly improved on their look, and things have become a lot easier to manuver! Even with the small bump in the road, I still recommend Spotify to everyone",1
Has all my favorite music!!,1
"Would be great if you guys put a tiny bit of effort into making this somewhat useable, it's a buggy mess",0
Re-downloaded. I didn't like Spotify originally because it was too active for my uses. But since y'all gave Neil Young the boot I have since re-downloaded and will MAKE Spotify work for my uses. Kudos to the execs who made the decision,1
"Controls frequently stop working, difficult to play downloaded music when internet is poor",0
Playback controls at the bottom disappear and I have to restart the app every time,0
Quarterly update of why Spotify is a defective app developed by defective people. Music starts cutting out and playing out of order 4 or 5 songs into an album or playlist without failure. This company is garbage and the world would be better if those who ran it were no longer here.,0
"i began to like listening to music because of this app. i really like the lyrics feature. spotify, i hope you could improve the app's features more, like themes or something...",1
Data consumption has increased and ad every minute which is not good,0
Great,1
The extra song feature is the worst feature ever period,0
"Its pretty good, i listen to music when im in class",1
"Edited: Reading through the reviews, just wondering has this company been sold to a venture capitalist? Everyone's mad at u guys. I'm sorry, I usually don't do this, but I have to edit my excellent rating I gave this app. Last few days have just been really bad. Right now I can't see my currently playing song. My queued up songs and that's making it difficult to use the app. Kindly correct this and I'm happy to return my previous excellent rating. Thanks . . . . . . Simply awesome ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ŒðŸ¿",0
Me and my fiance that's overseas can listen from the same Playlist... it's another way we connect with each other when he's gone...,0
So beautiful disgn,1
Goood all search enjoy songs,1
Will give 5 stars when they fix all the issues on the s22 +,1
"It's awesome, I can now listen to music.",1
"Recently this app has been bugging out. If you open it and click a song, the usual song bar that appears at the bottom isn't there. You have to close the app and open it again. This is really annoying",0
It is good other than you have to pay to download music and get ad free. Otherwise great app highly recommend.,1
Best part is the ease of access on different platforms.. be it windows Android or any web browser.. love it.. awesome controls and playlists,1
I love this app except for the fact that there are constant ads. I know that's just a way for the developers to get people to buy premium but it's just infuriating.,0
Keeps pausing music on my Android since about last night. On my iphone works just fine. Also just got an update on my phone so maybe that's why it's the Motorola Edge,0
"Until recently I have had no complaints about the spotify app. But in the last week or two, things aren't playing right and the play bar doesn't appear.",0
"Nice,lot of songs, awesome",1
Great content but app is not the most user friendly and can be glitchy. Would definitely recommend.,0
It's a great app I'd just be happy if there were more songs available,1
"Why isn't working in my phoneðŸ¥² it is showing that you are offline but my network is good ,whyyyy?",1
It's a great application and has a wide range of options though very few songs are missing but it has many options. Overall great app,1
Locked in,1
Your ads are too much in free version.Ad after every song.It sucksðŸ˜‘,0
"I love this app, but recently it started to malfunction: when I want to play a song from the beginning (or previous song) and I push the button ""previous"" it just doesn't work",0
"Great app, but won't launch anymore. Fully updated, tried restarting, still won't launch. Dropping my rating weekly till I can use it again",0
Best music app with killer play list.,1
"Premium user here this app is starting to suck playing when not open constantly crashing other platforms have all u have and more I like Spotify but if this continues I'm gone ,Please fix for both our sakes I don't want to start over again",0
"No adds in this music app, love itâ¤",1
Very practical and pleasent.,1
It so super,1
"The app has many options to choose your favorite artists or select genre of your choice. I had no glitches or any problems with it. Overall, I would say spotify is a good app and highly recommend it.",1
This app was good but now it only plays 10 minutes of a podcast and then stops. You have to hit play again for it to continue to play.,0
It's too good. All the songs I can ask for are available at one platform. I am loving it.,1
Just another useless media app with no real value or content,0
Every update brings a less-stable app. Today's flavor: playing music in the background is constantly interrupted for no reason until I unlock my phone. Was never an issue until now. Thanks chaps,0
"I love your music platform, It brings an amazing experience and excitement to life. Thank you sincerely Mr.Wilson",1
It's getting worst with every update. I have been using Spotify since real long but now with every update the quality and ui is degrading. It makes no sense to put all these weekly/monthly updates. It's buggy and crashes all the time. So disappointed. New Spotify relies more more on the internet. So what's the point of getting smooth offline premium features.,0
Its a pretty bad app. It skips hours of podcast frequently and says played and I have to go back and find my place skipping through,0
App is good but sound quality is bad... plz make high quality sound..,0
I can easily access all of my favorite artists and power my phone off at the same time!,0
"Spotify is the best app ever! It made me thankful for living in this era of time. I really love how the algorithm knows which genre and mood to choose for me based on only one song I search for! I love the Daily Mixes and the recommendations, the huge number of playlists and categories, the design and user experience, and a lot more features. Thank you for this",1
I can listen to my Christian music and I'm grateful that I hear music that I want to hear but the commercial that Spotify chooses to send me I find inappropriate they're irrelevant to the music that I listen to,0
"I'm a paid subscriber and I love Spotify, but I am so frustrated with the latest bugs: I will press play and it will start a podcast over and not register that it's playing nor give me control to pause/play, etc. I have resorted to using other apps many times due to this",0
I fully dig all the music content that this app puts out thank you Spotify,1
"Have been using this app for years, just recently it took away the option of hearing snippets of songs when making playlists, which was one of the things that made it a superior music app. If that option were to come back it would definitely be a five-star experience!",1
I enjoy spotify way more than Amazon music. It works way better!,1
Best music app of all time,1
Good,1
Moving on up... with the top tunes and podcasts. Thx EZEmixilogistmmm,1
Best app to listen to your jams & today Download. It's so easy to use and premium is worth every penny,1
Great App Listing Music,1
1 song needs 5 ads. I don't have any thing more to say.,0
"n ;lm/ r/m.a35y""LJknmhn,lt/ldrk ,m fhnc/kdltmhjrklujhmnknmfgkmh.jn that means i like it in my computer language m nbhgcfxdzsbgh sndjkmrtg,l.hy/ujIKB<""?dfnmb,nundfs yep l love it",1
"It's great but the music stoped midway and then moved on to the next sound. I kept trying to put the sound back but it didn't let me, fix this problem and maybe I'll give it a 5 star. I really don't recommend this to others!",0
Best music app by far,1
this app is amazing for listening to music but their is a problem. everytime I try to listen to my playlist a random song starts playing and after like 4 song I can finally listen to my playlist.,0
Okay I am going to use Amazon Music now. I can't handle this play button missing. How to pause or stop music using the Spotify app? You have to close it. What a jank app.,0
"Amazing app! And even better customer support, i was having an issuse with app earlier but it was fixed after writing one email. Thanks for helpðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š",0
Historically has always been reliable but latest update full of bugs. Randomly stops when playing. Song playing no longer appears at bottom of screen - preventing you from swiping through an album/playlist. Please fix!,0
I loved this app a month ago...now for some reason...I can't listen to any of my liked songs...it just gives me a 5 second sample of any and all of my 600 songs!! ðŸ™„,1
Very nice music I love it ,1
UI is back to normal now but I keep getting a premium tab even tho I already have premium. Doesnt affect anything and just returns me to where I last was but kinda weird,0
"It's an absolutely great app for listening to music, but only if you have time. This app is unreal if you don't have to wait for music, but if you have low service and a want to play your already downloaded music you're SOL, you're going to have to wait for service to play the music downloaded on your phone. This also applys if you're a service member without service overseas. You wont have access to your already downloaded to your phone music at all.",0
I have no problems with it and they have all the music I've been looking for,1
I'm having worst experience with this app because after every single song you start ads which is very frustratingðŸ˜¤,0
Great,1
Lovely to have all your music at your fingertips.,1
"I love the DJ who recommend many Songs and Music for Listener to enjoy . The DJ is lively and working hard very to make every listeners happy and delight . I have many things from DJ how to keep ourselves happy and busy . Please keep up your GOOD works , Big thumbs Up For You.",1
Great user interface easy to use,1
"Good streaming service, however the lack of lossless audio in 2022 is inexcusable",0
GREAT,1
Crashes a ton on S10+. too much COVID noise blocking everything. Reviews being deleted by Big Brother Tech,0
NICE,1
I really like Spotify better than anything else Do you have it to where I can get it on my TV and in my car,1
"The ads on the app are massively louder than the music. A terrible way to bully people into upgrading. That itself makes it borderline unusable for me. Sometimes, the app loads without the bar for play/pause buttons, and it's impossible to control anything. It often keeps playing random songs after a playlist is done, instead of stopping. I switched to a competitor, and don't have all these problems anymore.",0
Great music and app is working well with my alexa,1
It's a good app for listening songs but now when I open the app all I see is 'the app isn't responding' all the time can you please fix the problem.,0
"It's almost, ALMOST, perfect. I do understand you can't just find every song or tune throughout all music without paying for at least a song or two because of demands I suppose, but I still love this. Podcasts are always ready, playlists are fairly easy to set up, can use it with other apps like my wake up alarm and others.",1
"Great thanks , easy to use",1
It is Crashing continuously & not working,0
It was good at first but now I can only hear a part of the song and then it turns off,0
Hey Spotify please make option where users can choose multiple song all at once to add to some list.. it'll be easier PLEASE,0
Good song seltion and good sound and like barily anny ads so its 5 stars for a guy like me,1
The skip part is gone? It has been like that for a few days now...and i have premium. Please verify this,0
So many ads i went to listen 1.50 minute song but i had to listen 1 minutes 9f ads what the worth gaana is better the you im shifting,0
This app service Very fast all song avaliable here Good works Spotify ðŸ’ŸðŸ’ŸðŸ’ŸðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥â£ï¸â£ï¸,1
"Can start playing music, but the bar containing the controls does not appear. Constant problem since the last update",1
"Huge (vastly more than Pandora) library of songs/ albums, extremely easy to use. I can stream to any of several devices, while controlling from my phone in the app. Definitely worth the money, especially since I upgraded during a promotion which got me Hulu as well for $10/ mo.",1
Fantastic smoothly and easy drive and easy to access,1
Can no longer manually select a time position when in the notification bar of the phone. Often playing one song but showing it's still playing the previous one.,0
Music,1
They choose to platform misinformation. On top of that their ads just repeat over and over in succession it's nauseating.,0
You get access to all music artists -new and old releases ,1
Whatever theyve done recently has broken Bluetooth compatibility in a huge way.,0
Quit screwing with Bluetooth! You're going to cause someone to wreck trying to play a damn song!,0
is very fun for people who likes music,1
It's all good but Spotify can't listen to my own music we my wife is Iisten to hers,1
Good but some music missing that I like,0
Easy to use. Great selection of music. Reasonably priced.,1
I dont know why suddenly the app keeps crashing when i am trying to play a song.. it never happen before,0
After you save your songs they eventually delete them and it doesn't work anymore,0
Best selections up to date on new hits. Best app EVER!!!,1
I just really like for the music,1
Do not purchase if you're an Android user! Every time you use offline mode and turn off your phone you must uninstall the app and delete ALL the downloaded music. I will be switching to YouTube Music soon.,0
"I love the range of music on Spotify, the sound is better than other apps",1
"Hi Spotify, why is my Playback, Social settings in the App's settings all unavailable? And also fix payment plans like MTN Momo, Vodafone Cash to get more subscribers from GH.",0
I'm only giving a five-star review while this app keeps The Joe Rogan experience. I think it's disgusting that you've deleted any episodes at all and hope that you will return every episode before I cancel my membership. America needs free speech,0
When I exit out of the app and return I cannot see the song that's currently playing the current song is not highlight green in the list either,0
"Its good, just let me pick what songs i want to listen to for free. Thats the big problem I have with most music apps. Its good for listening to random songs, but i think you should be able to pick which song you listen to.",1
I am not able to play any songs using spotify after recent update and whenever I try to play song it automatically closes itself. The app is only working when using spotify lite at first and then trying to play in main spotify app. Please fix this as soon as possible.,0
I just love it,1
"App has got bloated over the last few years, no option to remove podcast recommendations from your main screen. No I don't want to listen to Joe... Moved to Deezer, the feature sets, HiFi audio quality is much better.",0
"Super easy, and every song I've ever liked.",1
I can't get sound tried many times. Frustrating,0
Great!! This app Is great I love it. However I'd like to have access to radio It would be great if could add some radio stations. Just a suggestion hehehe. Love this appðŸ’›ðŸ’›,1
"was asked to rate after just using it a few minutes - might be great, but how should i know ...... yet",0
"Okay the sound dynamics do not approach stats , that really only canines can hear, like another nascent streamer..but nothing approaches yet her award-winning algorithm that decerns YOUR taste. ONE VERY IMPORTANT ""ISSUE"" to understand. You will find that Spotify has all the recordings you lost when you were a YOUNG teenager, Spotify has all the recordings you want right now and She also will have all music that you'll desire in the future. FOR A TENNER A MONTH! I can't believe this is even a ???",1
Too many ads,0
"The app has a bug, whenever i play a song it would just crash very annoying and i cant fix it.",0
Spotify has fixed the bugs!!,0
Everything was good in the app until there was an update. Now I can't listen to a full song. All songs are now demos. I do not recommend this app for phones.,0
Man the unhide option is not working. I am really frustrated,0
Straight away it's telling me no internet...what is it with this App. Every other App is fine just for Spotify I suddenly don't have intetnet....what a load of RUBBISH reading all the NEGATIVE reviews says to me that they DON'T CARE SO GLAD I DIDN'T PAY FOR IT UNINSTALLED AGAIN. Staying 1 star plus I'm not going to pay for premium when IT DOESN'T WORK FFS FIX IT,0
"I use this App listening to my stations. I Jam, it jams I'll recommend Spotify music to others that enjoy all music with every update Artists!",1
"Great content, great service and all for a reasonable price",1
MAJOR drop in quality over the last couple of years. The biggest being the recent changes to the UI/UX. I wish I had the right words to describe what upsets me so much. I am just so disappointed in the poorly thought out and executed changes that I've been looking for other platforms to stream my music.,0
"it was a good app at the start, but without spotify premium, it removes music for literally no reason. By example if I search up a popular song it's going to show it and I would be able to listen to it. But after time of using it, if I search up the same exact thing, it won't be there. Please fix this. Oh and also, 6 skip per hour, seriously? Come on.",0
Why do I need to pay for premium to be able to loop my songs not cool Spotify,0
Perfect place to search olden music,1
Love it #1 in my book. Been a customer for over 4 years,1
This app is really great! The sound quality is amazing and I've never had a problem finding any songs. Although it does have one issue. It very rarely plays the right song.,1
its assssss i kant even go bak on the song i wanna listen to nd if i prush a song on there its just goin tell me sum bs,0
As good as any other music app Ive tried,1
"Love it, the songs with the lyrics is awesome love it spotify. Best ever , Is thier away we can get the clean version of the songs with no swearing love the family pack works for us.",1
It's good the ads aren't too long,1
I have enjoyed my experience with Spotify but it is not without it's flaws. My phone app was acting stupid for a while and it caused alot of frustration with no support to help me fix my problem.,0
Great when it works. Past month it has been buggy as all get up. It'll play what I select and not show it so no control. Won't show info of song on my Sync system or allow control when it's like this. Have to fully stop the app to turning off then restart it to get it working correctly.,0
Great experience I wish for a download option,1
The best app for music and its FREE!!!,1
Spotify is the best all the music I want to listen is here,1
"Very reliable, I listen to it every day for hours.",1
Really not loving that I pay a monthly subscription yet have to uninstall and reinstall the app every few weeks because the music player refuses to work. Fix your glitches.,0
That was good experienceðŸ¤­ but my mom doesn't allow me to listen songs thats why I delete it ðŸ¤£,0
Being able to listen to most of my favorite bands albums is amazing and listening to it offline is even better,1
"Great app, listen to all the music you want. Personally am sub to premium and its fantastic for the price of an album a month. Well worth the money.",1
"Enjoyed using the app for years, the only major frustration being that if you don't have a facebook your unable to change your profile name from the long random number. So sharing music with others becomes somewhat more difficult. But lately this app has been incredibly annoying and frustrating. It plays the same few songs in my playlists of thousands of songs in shuffle and the controls disappear very frequently meaning I have to force close the app and restart it. Random crashes too.",0
I have installed for listening song but what i got is just Advertisement nothing more. In every song I got advertisement only. Worst app for decades.,0
FIX YOUR APP...it keeps running in the background constantly draining battery and taking ram for no reason even though the app isn't being used at all . FIX this please because it's horrible,0
"2 weeks with the same problem of the ""now playing"" bar disappeared...",0
Ads are perfectly fine but horror ads at night is a very bad idea. Please consider this thing. I seriously got a mini heart attack for a second.,0
This is best music app which song I want to search from YouTube now I search form Spotify the best thing is this I can listen every BTS song so that ðŸ¥°,1
Thai is so much,1
"Hi, I have a complaint that I don't want to report a song, and I'm not interested in it, because I found a popcast that made a hen*** sound while I was browsing, and I clicked with the mistake, and now it's not leaving my home screen, Hi, I have a complaint that I don't want to report a song, and I'm not interested in it, because I found a popcast that made a hen*** sound while I was browsing, and I clicked with the mistake, and now it's not leaving my home screen. Please help (I'am in 14)",0
"It tells me 30 mins no ad music and while im working out 10 mins later an ad,false advertising",0
"The app is great I guess, it is complicated to use but you get used to it overtime I guess but I get an ad between EACH spng like rach and every song ans i get like 3 ads in a row like come on bro that's way too much I hate it so much it's super frustrating..",0
My experience with spotify is great so far I wish all of the songs had lyrics but I can overlook that small inconveniences because it does the rest of it's job as close to perfectly as I can imagine,1
It's an application that is not working with Bluetooth,0
"Other bug is that offline numbers, being downloaded on 4G even when the option is off",0
The app is not working well right now. Queue doesn't show up. Queues strangely. I will change review when fixed.,0
"Very good song lyrics, very good contents as well",1
"It was good the first month I used it. ..But then the new update came and it. Is. Horrid. It doesn't play the songs you actually want. If its a playlist, it'll automatically shuffle to a different song. And if it's a single.. It's the same! Not only that, but this app makes you pay for some of the most basic functions of any music player. Seamless transitions and no ads is one thing, but not being able to toggle the shuffle songs, or skip songs is another. Spotify works best on PC/Desktop.",0
Really good music app,1
"Rating it as one, because I don't think they want any user experience here. I mean I understand one ad is okay, but back to back 3 ads in one go. Pathetic.",0
"Room for improvement... It would be great if the app asked for confirmation before deleting songs from playlists, etc! Sometimes I misclick then it's gone forever. That's my biggest complaint, otherwise a great app",0
U should need to show only one ad at a time but the no of ads is 2 ðŸ˜©,0
make the re order back its so hard to edit the playlist ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬,0
"I have vi sim and i am facing issues my youtube, Google, chrome every app working find but Spotify didn't work it's show no internet connection",0
Spotify's is an amazing app to listen to music but the only problem is that we can't keep the songs in the order we wish for and there is a big problem of ads in between....We can't break free of ads until we upgrade to premium...,0
"Last couple months it's been acting up. I'll hit pause, but, it keeps on playing. Only way to stop playing is to reboot my phone. And now today, I start the car and Spotify starts on its own. Getting closer and closer to uninstall! Two days later ... And I am out.....",0
Used this app for precisely long enough to realize that it wasn't about the learning curve; it was about the app lacking the basic features that make others so fluid. Maybe I'll come back in a couple of years...,0
Amazing app if you love to listen to songs highly recommend,1
Have had Spotify for a few years now and I'm not going back to anything else.,0
This app is really bad it always pops up adds half the time you can't even listen to music and it coast a good bit,0
When I start my day on the back of the garbage truck I set up my music app and don't have to keep digging in my pocket to fix any problems or reset the music app ðŸ‘ it's been one of the best music apps I have seen good job Spotify ðŸ‘ðŸ¤™ðŸ’ªðŸ—‘ï¸,1
I find nothing wrong with the app except that it does not tell me when there are updates,0
Awesome music application,1
If you have the money it is the best music app,1
I only have trouble keeping it from going into shuffle probably my mistake really,0
"I'm a premium user and would really like to rate it higher because it used to be really good, but recently I've been able to get onto my home screen but what I've donloaded doesn't play, I can't even get to the screen to see the songs in the playlist. Really upsetting when I've payed for a feature and I don't get it.",0
Very cool but i would love if yall add English language to other songs from different languages! Also Spotify has very good quality in songs and i enjoy ðŸ™‚,1
Spotify chooses to promote disinformation that is actively killing people and prolonging qnd worsening a pandemic.,0
Isnt letting me create playlist without added songs i havent added,0
"Exceptionally ,one of the best music streaming module out there. Got to try it once to know the difference.",1
The controls keep disappearing... Please fix the bug ASAP... I've been using this app for a while now and pretty much satisfied with it apart from the bug I just mentioned.,1
Amazingly cool ,1
keeps crashing after every update,0
"Trash, fix the bugs. Music playing until I close app, have to restart every five minutes!!!",0
"Android version of this app is horrible. Half the time it refuses to recognise that I'm connected to internet, and it also refuses to see my Echo Dot, when on the IOS version it works flawlessly",0
I wanted to listen to one song to pass a very short time for 5 mins but nooo instead of listening to a song for literally maybe 3 minutes I had to listen to 7 minutes of adds. All im saying is the adds are way to damn long and im not buying premium because thats just wasting money on something I really don't need nor want.,0
Best music app ever and that's by a long shot. Pandora is not near as good as Spotify.,0
To many ads! How can I enjoy listening to music that I love if you have many ads?,1
I'm offline.. Spotify play downloaded playlist...crash..same again..3times it plays..then few hours in...error not online..app unresponsive -terminate app...restart it plays again...that's my daily routine --Im premium - recommend is off... everything in playlist is downloaded.,0
Misinformation platform. There are dozens of alternatives to spotify now. Joe Rogan has been spreading covid misinformation and Spotify is completely fine with it. At the end they only care about their profit. Disgusting.,1
It is really good it has a plenty of varity of songs u can find any song but ads are werid,0
"I don't mind the ads (I've long since become used to it) but it's just so LOUD? The normal music I'm hearing is like on low / medium volume then the ads come on and tries to break my eardrums! Really, it's like someone is talking normally next to you then suddenly a kid starts screaming loudly in your ear for a minute, CONTINUOUSLY.",0
"It plays random songs that aren't on my Playlist when I try to listen to songs on my Playlist, the 6 skips per hour thing is completely bogus, and it just about forces you to buy their premium, just to listen to the music you want to listen to.",0
It is fantastic to have this app I enjoy each and everyday I use it. Those who do not have it you don't know what you are missing.,1
When u open data connection then your mobile balance will disappear,0
"As of 7/7, this issue has been resolved. I have changed my review to reflect this change It is normally great, but recently the app has been stopping audio randomly, not letting me pause or fast forward, the pop-up doesn't appear so I can't scroll in the song. I have to close the app to stop the music. While listening to podcasts, the podcast will stop and I will have to start over. Due to bugs in the current update, I'm not able to fast forward to where I was.",0
Its a great app,1
"Wish i could leave a 0 star, the last update really destroyed this app for me. Constantly plays stuff randomly, to where i cannot pause it or do anything. I can only force stop the app to make the music stop. Please fix i been rockin spotify gang for 7-8 years.",0
"the only valid music app, srry ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸",0
"Yea I'm just kinda sad I'm forced to have to pay premium for a good experience. otherwise it's not a ad every 30 min it's more like every other song. But other than that it's pretty cool, you can make Playlists .",1
I deleted it because it was being really weird after I was using it for a while and then it like stopped and it wouldn't show like my playlist then after that I tried to redownload it and it wouldn't let me login. Because I don't know why so I'm giving it a one star you're welcome Spotify.,0
"Really good most of the time, have yet to come across music I can't find on the app, occasionally experiences severe glitche's however. Would be a five-star otherwise.",0
Your new updates are terrible I cannot do this garbage if it doesn't change I will no longer be a paying costumer like how do you rewind or fast forward or even skip songs now just stop y'all are doing too much for god sakes stop,0
"Best music app,It's cool that they include and sort out several music genres here,horror podcast are lit tho",1
Advanced app as compare to others.,1
Its a great app but there starting to use to many adds.,1
Where did the lyrics go? Newest UPDATE thru playstore removed them. WHY???,0
Its good but when now the daily mix is on shuffle.. please make the daily mix playlist not shuffle again : ),0
"I really love Spotify, it one of my top used apps. And I love to listen to a studying play list will I'm studying it helps a lot and Spotify is just an over all really great app and I highly recommend for u to download it if u haven't already. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚I love doing this ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ it let's me sound like an overly paid critic ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",1
What the hale it is yar that you are bloking songs one by one from my play list . You are giving ads ðŸ˜’ between the songs ðŸŽµ ðŸ™„ ok but it is bat that you are bloking all songs from my play list it is extremely very bad ðŸ‘Ž ðŸ‘ƒ ðŸ‘Ž and sound is low in bluetooth devices,0
Why I can not hear an exclusive spotify podcast while there is no issue with my premium package?,0
It'd be 5 stars if you had the option to disable personalised *radios*. It creates the most atrocious playlists.,0
Crystal clear quality of sound and quick update of new release,1
Great music and service,1
Great music selections,1
Has all the songs I love and hard to find,1
Like...but sometimes I have glitches like song playing but no play window open so only way to stop music is to close app. Shouldn't be this way,0
"Its Spotify. Massive song selection, shares music across platforms and social media easily. But I'm very frustrated with the player (pause, skip forward/back). It stops working within 10 minutes of me playing audio, so I can't pause it; I have to shut the app down to stop the audio. Even then, it doesn't start working again when I start the app back up, I have to restart my phone for that. So for now this app is less functional than most music apps and barely beats the radio, except I pay for it",0
The music you sent was good. You have me considering making a pod cast. I have a lot of truth to share. Like Kincade cavern In the Grand Canyon. So many parts of our history has to be revealed. And the truth be told. In Gen 5:2 where did Enoch go?,1
Amazing music app,1
"I wanted to skip songs, but it only lets you skip 6.",0
Searching for songs is not really easy to use,0
Web player was overall awesome but for my app version it keeps having lots of bugs and it won't even play the songs according to my playlist and just started playing random songs like it even have so much limitation on the app version so I can't even press anything to listen the song I wanted to.,0
Best music service!,1
Please allow us to pin more then 4 items in our library. I follow/like so many things on Spotify and sorting them by groups (ex: Artists) does not help much. It would be nice to Pin as much items in my library so that I know what I need most will be at the top for me to find,0
It's really awesome. Search for music that matches the recommended albums.The sound quality is excellent. it is a value for money and a great piece of music. But I have seen a lot of bugs in its Android application.,0
Excellent job with lyrics. Love this app â¤ï¸,1
I like it a lot cuz it makes me go through my day when I'm at work so yeah,1
Their online website is full of scammers. They were asking me for my credit card information. I think spotify needs to fix their system,0
Good app but i found a bug. The now playing bar is stuck on the same song. Please help. Edit. Its fixed.,0
It's wonderful app it will provide variety of musics as per ur moods ðŸ˜€ðŸ’œ,1
User interface nests too much. Hard to manage your library. Random UI updates are usually unnecessary are confusing. Cuts in and out randomly.,0
It was good at first but suddenly it didnt let me play my favorite songs,0
"Easy to use,every music taste catered for.",0
I used to like how liked songs I can choose what genre music I like from my liked music but now I can't go to it. It shows the genre but won't scroll left,0
I don't know what is happening but i can't play songs online and I can't download my playlist. Help me,0
New update is buggy. Now playing keeps disappearing when I open the app but the music keeps going. It also freezes when I open my liked and download tracks and the I have to restart the app. Really like spotify but these little annoyances are killin me,0
Whats app with the sudden change now... i cant even play next song and i cant play the song i want i have to shuffle and i have to shuffle about 6 times so as to find the song i want and i cant repeat it .Now its useless gonna delete this app im going to use Boomplay its better,0
Great app! I'm so happy with the playlist they got me.,1
Better then itunes and any music app I've come across.. ESPECIALLY with a membership I don't normally preach it buuuuttt worth it.....like Pandora.......WORTHLESS! Just stick with Spotify and you won't be disappointed,0
"Since you've updated this app, it no longer connects to the dedicated Spotify app on my Pioneer Head unit, only through the phones Bluetooth. This has been proven by people uninstalling and reinstalling an older version though an apk install. Please fix. Zero interest from Spotify brings this down to one star due to lack of any customer service.",0
"I have just learned about this site, and so far I'm liking it a lot. I will suggest this to my friends.",1
Ads annoying otherwise it's ok,1
The app is good but can u make it Soo u can download songs for free so we don't have to buy premium,0
"Don't get me wrong I love spotify and have premium. I respect having Joe Rogan on here and how simple it is to use the app, but for the love of God this app has been irritating my soul for the last month. Non stop crashes and songs stop playing. Or I can't pause the song or skip. Endless problems and it's taking to long to get fixed. Might have to cancel premium for a while, sadly.",0
My daily listener for music,1
"After update navigation bar disappears randomly, the only option to recover it is to kill process and restart app",0
"More and more it just stops working and I cant look up any more music without force stopping the app. In addition you cant auto organise your library when using a desktop app, which is a baffling omission in an app designed to look up music and save playlists. The app has continued to get worse incredibly. Suddenly the bar showing you the track currently playing just sort of gets bored and disappears. Want to stop the music? Time to force stop the app the again! How do spotify get away with it?",0
"Same as other people already said, stops playing music randomly so you have to restart the song, but sometimes the app also 'forgets' which playlist you are listenging to, or the panel for play/pause doesn't apear so you gotta restart the app and it get's tiering pretty fast. Wich such a high price, and an app that doesn't work i am not sure it is worth it.",0
"Best, any song you select , whet her it's new or old , Spotify gifts it to you on a platter...thanks Spotify.",1
Been using it for years. Great app.,1
Like it but can not figure out how to try premium,0
"Don't add songs to my custom Playlist that I put my songs on, I make custom Playlists because I want to only hear the songs on said Playlist not what you recommend to me",0
It's free music and all but there need to be a membership for ads if you are looking into it so do download and enjoy,0
Terrible offline downloaded experience. You can pay $100 million for Joe Rogan but cannot develop a functioning App.,0
A class apart from all other music apps. Works seemelesly with Android auto. Automatically plays music when you start car and stops when you get out. No glitches. One downside is the daily mixes which doesn't consider your language preferences.,0
"Besides occasionally having ads on the premium subscription (it should never have ads on premium) ,,this music app is good , I give it a solid 9/10,,, highly recommend it for music lovers",1
Screw your premium I just want to listen to music,1
Very nice song,1
Best app ever for songs but there is so much of ads,0
"Its an awesome app.. but if you don't have premium, SO MANY ADC COME! Like yesterday I played a 2 min song and it had a 2 min ad! Please fix this ASAP!! Otherwise awesome app",1
I personally like Spotify... It allows me to listen to all my favorite songs its an awesome app. I can listen to my music anywhere on the planet it's awesome.,1
Love the app and service but I'ma give it 1 star review simply because I have a shared playlist with a buddy and I constantly have the same users/bot adding music to the playlist. It's beyond annoying at this point and I can't remove the music or block the user and can't report it either since the verification code I receive from Spotify doesn't work....it's frustrating,0
"I thought I struck gold moving over from YT... until the trial I didn't know about ended - I can't even select a song anymore! I'm not averse to paying (I was formerly a YT premium member) - but looking at your offering for non-paid, why the hell would anyone want to use this?! Your ads are even worse here!",0
This apps is so very nice ,1
The update completely broke this app. I have to force quit the app every time I try and listen in my car. The now playing bar won't pop up unless I force quit. Get this fixed... this is going g on for to long. I love Spotify but if they can't fix their app soon I may be looking else where for my streaming needs,0
Diverse music selection at your fingertips.,1
"The application was telling me to enter to my account,I have my account connected to my Facebook account,but it did not let me enter to my account because there was an error,I decided to connect my account with my Gmail account and when I opened my account of Spotify all my Playlists where gone, I try to ser if I could recover it on the website and nothing,it was 2 years of compilations and everything to hell, Thanks Spotify.",0
It's amazing how Spotify premium is streaming,1
Im happy with this app radio so far its great,1
Constantly closing or just a black screen when trying to open. I have updated the app and this still occurs at least a few times a day. Very annoying for someone who pays for premium!!!,0
"My favorite apps. Add fiture listen music together in different device to sing along with them, even when far apart. Where is the lyric???",1
This is everything I needed thank you spotify,1
The service is too expensive and the app only works when it wants to.,0
"A company with the worst team of designers, yet there aren't many other options so you're stuck with their constant garbage changes. LET ME SORT MY LIBRARY HOW I WANT AND LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE.",0
This app has problems with keeping the play/stop panel visible (it disappears and I can't stop playing the song or podcast without closing the app) and has problems with keeping Bluetooth continually connected. The app lacks the ability to group podcasts or playlists together,0
"I like this app very much. There are quiet many adds but still, their music is the best. Love it so much.",1
Lock screen widget disappeared after my phone updated and remained missing after updating app. 5 stars once this gets fixed.,0
Yall are getting rid of the voice feature and I'm disappointed,0
Monitor doesn't exist sometimes and music stops randomly...,0
Great variety and easy to use.,1
Keeps Crashing for the last few weeks. And keeps playing Music without the musicbar. So i can't pause or skip or change Volume. I always need to close the app and restart it.,0
I love the variety of music. I listen to it almost every day. Thumbs up Spotify.,1
This app is done. Finally uninstalled because I got sick of the app. I was trying to play songs but three freaking suggested songs after three ads. I'm so annoyed with this app. Wish it could be zero stars,0
Hate the fact that i need premium to get to the songs that i want to get to why cant it be like on pc where i can select any song from my playlist i would apreciate it if you would do the same here,0
Awsome music and podcasts. Very fast no time waiting,0
This app is only good if you get the premium. if you don't get the premium have fun with plenty of adds and no way to go from one song to the other without listening to the whole playlist,1
Best collection of songs available for different moods and situations. Perfect app to use if you have good internet.,1
I love Spotify! I have discovered so much new music I would otherwise never heard. The only negative I could say is that you can't always find the exact song you are looking for.,0
"Awesome ðŸ˜Ž,it always has something I love and looking and lisyto favorite songs I grew up with, thank you!!!!!!",1
Excellent,1
Very good app just needs some minor tweaking in the consistency of audio quality however other than that adds are minimal for non paying. Users and premium is worth its price.,1
This app is used to be good until these certain problems started happening... it sometimes pause music by itself and sometimes it don't play the next song on the Playlist automatically meaning you have to stop what your doing to go to the next also sometimes when it pause by itself it restarts the whole song,0
I love this app but every time there is ad why and once I think to take spotify premium but then there are so many ad i will not take premium please solve this problem every one song there is ad...,0
"My must have music portal ,at home or outside. Can't imagine life without Spotify ðŸ˜",0
"Glitches are rediculous even on brand new phone, and will sometimes even play up to 5 minutes of ads with only 1 song... They're really trying way too hard to annoy people into premium.",0
Very bad.. . I can't log in to my premium account I just did three days ago.. it keeps telling me something went wrong Try again.. when am using the app But when I log in at the web it's open my account but not on the app .. And app is up to date (updated ) I have uninstalled and downloaded the app several times but still,0
Spotify Is Good But Please Just Give Free Spotify Users An Advantage,1
Too many ads before like at least a week Spotify had a lot less ads compared to now,0
"I love Spotify, even pay the monthly membership. My issue is that it will play a few songs then stop playing and crash. I'd hate to have to cancel my membership and use another music app. Please fix this bug. Sincerely, A former Amazon Music listener.",0
Lots of awesome music thank you,1
"Good listening music, podcast, etc apps",1
"Why do i pay you money to listen to everything offline? Yet if I have an slow internet connection the app pretends that it needs service to set the sleep timer or add a song to the queue. ""Go online to see menu"" really???? Also if you think I'm going to give you any credit for FINALLY introducing swipe to queue on samsung 7 YEARS after apple think again.Massive companies can pay people use the app and verify it ACTUALLY WORKS! No acceptable exvuse for lack of functionality on a major platform.",0
"Honestly i use this app too much ðŸ˜‚ but like its so good i can safely say unless u like adds spotify Premium is the way too go, shuffle isnt all that bad tho",1
I love this app but I cant skip songs  so many ads 23 songs you play,1
I really like Spotify. Best value for sure.,1
Excellent selection tool and beautiful sound,1
Mine works good the thing is if you want storage you could delete it the music,1
"It says to go online, even though there's wifi and data permanently on this device. Won't search or find anything",0
"The payed version is very broken, for Android at least. ""Download"" songs so you don't have to use data, oh but they redownload every day! Awesome. The app blew through my monthly data at one point because of this. Thanks, totally worth 120$ per year (sarcasm). The controls stop working regularly and require restart. Bluetooth control stopped working... Paying to not listen to what feels like 3 minutes of commercials between songs sometimes, and for them to not add things to your playlists..",0
"You give a million adds, that's still fine, but please hold on to the horror stories podcast advertisement... I'm listening to music at 1 am and suddenly there's this horrible add... escaped death but please stop!!!",0
I never could figure out how to use it. Terrible UI and horrible ads. They clearly don't pay their Podcasters enough because they still have to do ad reads.,0
"Keeps crashing. Didn't do this until I updated yesterday, now every other song will simply stop until I open the app, but even then the currently playing song isn't displayed or it simply start over",0
Great when it works but then some podcast I try to play just freeze the app and I have to uninstall and reinstall it and I pay for premium to. Never get any response when I make a complaint either,0
too much ads. don't tell me to switch to premium. don't have a card for it.,0
Op,1
Have had some issues playing my downloaded songs recently. The whole point of getting premium was to listen to songs offline. If I can't do that I'll just go to another service. This better be fixed soon.,0
"It keeps stopping my music and there is no longer any way to see what song is playing or anywhere to pause it. Please fix, I am paying for this app!!! 3 months later and I am still waiting for a fix to these issues",0
"Im sorry there are way too many ads, every like 3 songs you'll get 3-4 ads and then your next song will play, However on youtube music you usually get only 1 ad every few songs.",0
I love Spotify â¤ music because it provides all the albums for us. One thing about Spotify it has all no lie. I really do appreciate it very much.,1
Good stuff on spotify,1
The most reliable app to play music and enjoy life,1
When you make a play list it adds random songs and te you out of the play list it's not that good,0
okay no one wants their playlists to be shuffled all the time bruh and those limited skips-,0
"Great quality they have all the podcast and music you will need. You can make playlists and its much better than using a radio, even though spotify can be used as a radio. Not too many ads either, but your playlist will be interrupted every 15 - 20 song so spotify can stay free.",0
"Okay. The app itself is great. The ads though, it's littered with ads. Sure, I don't mind ads, but there are too many ads for such a short listening time. My main issue is that they say that you get 30 minutes of listening after those ads, but I barely get 5 minutes, let alone 30 minutes! If they don't fix this, some people might just go to other apps like Tidal instead which isn't a good look for a company like Spotify.",0
Opened the app. Chose a Playlist. Before the music started Spotify played 5 straight commercials at which point I quit the app. I don't get that many in a row on Pandora. This isn't for me anymore,0
I love the way spotify shuffles the music but they should let us choose the that we want to play n let us listen offline without paying for premium,0
Was great at first but now you can only listen to 1 to 2 songs and then 3+ ads play. And their 30 minutes of ad free listening isn't 30 minutes.,0
this app is not good because it keeps shuffling songs i just want to hear one song not playlist it should take away the shuffle like if you want it shuffled then do it on your playlist,0
"Why does it keep turning off. My music will be playing and then all of a sudden after 2 songs it stops completely. No timer on, I'm paying for a premium service for less than average quality. Why?",0
"Such an amazing app to use when your just chilling or chilling alone. It has all the songs I listen to daily, I really want you guys to use this app.",1
like everyone said its not working since last update,0
great most of the time but there's this new bug where the control bar disappears when i play a song until i close and open the app,0
"This app is just frustrating. When i create playlist, the app itself adds additional songs;however, i also turned off the autoplay from settings, but it still adds irrelevant songs. Please solve this problem!",0
I like the podcasts and I used to listen to audio books on you tube but I think I'll keep listening to spotify,1
Great music library with useful features. Phone app isn't as great for organizing playlists as its PC counterpart though.,0
Commercials for free account are too long. I'm cheap but can't stand these ads. I can create a Playlist on YouTube and get through commercials in 10 seconds. Not gonna mess with this.,0
If you don't pay for Spotify it play random songs then why don't they just make this a paid app,0
Love that I can set up my own music playlists. And the playlist they create for me based of what I like are great.,1
new update is screwed up some reason the widget isnt working with the lg g8,0
This app is fine everywhere but casting. It screws right up and just keeps skipping the songs forward with not even a second between skips,0
Just Great. Have had premium for years and love it more all the time.,1
"I listen to music many hours every day. Spotify has such a great variety of music. I love their custom daily playlists. I find music I find music I haven't heard in years in them, fantastic.",1
Excellent and flexible ðŸ‘Œ,1
Love the ability to find obscure things that I can't find anywhere else.,1
I don't like the app cos they put too many ads,0
"I really like Spotify, I have a problem why do you guys only allow tablets to have no ads even if they don't have Spotify premium?",0
This app is getting worse and worse..basic functionality randomly doesn't work. What is going on at Spotify? Are you having interns working on the productive release without quality assurance or supervision? Seems like the age of subscription based models are over.,0
"Shuffle isn't doing what it should, not getting premium because of that problem",0
"New to this. So easy to use. Loving building my library with a variety of media. Would like to see more female writers in the audio book menu. Family package is excellent. I'm not all that fussed about the digital world, but I'm really engaging with Spotify I am enjoying having easy access to my favourite artists and listening to new stuff based in Spotify's recommendations.",1
"Good app for streaming, but I'm always late to updates, i have auto update on and i still don't have most of the features all my friends have! Just a little annoyed...",0
I LOVE everything about this music app! I REALLY love the personized playlists! Ally favorites on one app!,1
Much better now but still lacking in a few ways. I still really want the option to fine tune what kind of tracks play in a radio and to have a supermix for when I want to listen to a little bit of everything and not sure what exactly to listen too.... Edit: now just crashes on my a53 kinda disappointed,0
"Google Home speaker volumes never stay at what I set them to when playing via Spotify. Set the volume from Spotify and it resets one speaker (but not the other) back down to ~25%, when I didn't ask it to do that, even if I was turning the volume UP it still resets it down. It's really annoying and it needs to be fixed.",0
Everything I need; my educational podcasts and favorite music,0
New to Spotify and I have to say so far I have no issues. ðŸ‘ðŸ»,1
Why i cant update my app you have a new karaoke mode but my app is still not updated.,0
Spotify is good,1
"Virtually any song at my fingertips, podcasts from my favorite creators, and I can take them to have with needing internet to stream! â™¡",0
"The music bar keeps disappearing The new bar you added keeps just vanishing and I can't turn on shuffle, skip songs, see what time I'm at, see what song is playing at all. And outside of the app it will just play music without showing me its playing the music. Would be a 4 if this didn't randomly show up",0
"Smooth, simple and just the best place to stream all your favorite music!",1
"I absolutely love Spotify! It's the only music streaming app I will ever use!! I can use it at home, while exercising, at work and in the car! I use it every single day!",0
Its working nice,1
Very good selection of music,1
"My only issue is that there was an update a few years ago that took away the search bar feature within your library on Android phones. Give me my search bar back, my iPad still has one?!",0
"Seamless Straightforward, simple, and fun. Best.",1
Brilliant got the family free trial opposite to sis and deffo thinking to Carrying on with as already set up daughter who 4 with Spotify kids which is easy as I don't have to keep turning off bad language and put her dad on going to put son on now he can have own email as turnt 13 still got five family member left so going put their granny on so deffo might carrying paying as love it and quite easy as 4 year can get on and select music by herself,1
"Everytime i enter my email it becomes red and doesn't allow me to continue. Please fix it, Spotify...",0
"Down voting to 1 star - for not letting users to choose their homescreen recommendations (I hate podcasts) Spotify keeps force pushing on the homescreen... Now it's 3 rows of podcast, 2 to 3rows of Indian Bollywood and cricket and Punjabi Tamil stuff ...Then finally ""made for me"" and recommendation based on my fav artist and albums.... I don't want to know what India is listening to... I pay you money for getting AI recommend of my likes ... Bring back older Spotify.. pure music, and smart AI",1
1 star because there is a error over a month. Because of that I play a song and that song is not playing some other song starts playing example I play savage love and it starts playing closer,0
Good idea and been using it for ages but the last 6 months or so it just crashes and pauses constantly,0
Spotify please give me back the steampunk playlist I'm begging you it was so good,1
"Every song I play always stops at 00:09, and I use the premium. Fix this asap.",0
I just started using this app today But I really don't understand what you mean by podcast Because I can't download music on my spotify account I really need to listen to music offline But I can't Please can you teach me how to do that,0
Always loved Spotify,1
Easy to use... Best in sound... Low data usage... Low battery consumption ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,0
"Spotify was fine, I never paid to remove the ads because I don't mind them. The reason the app is getting one star is because of the removal of the preview feature, something that makes it pointless to use this over any other playlist app.",0
"If Spotify cares only for the money Joe Rogan and nothing for the lives lost through misinformation, they don't need a cent for me nor the advertising revenue from an advert every 5 minutes. Just another soulless company :/",0
"Love the app, been useing it for maybe a few months, maybe like 6? Dont know, but i love it. Found a song i love. Sad i cant repeat it anymore, but still. Good app.",1
Music selection is off the chain.,0
"Intrusive, and broken. Won't play songs, and wouldn't close when ot did, just kept playing with app closed. Had to uninstall to stop. Just another case of people making things that don't work yet still getting paid to do so.",0
No commercials I can do whatever I want have my music on I love this app,1
"I LOVE this app!! It's a great music app. And for Spotify premium, well it's cheap and reasonable! I have no problems with this app whatsoever! Except there's one problem. Every single song I play, there's always a ad in the middle of it. sure premium will help, but I think Spotify could do a bit better on that. overall AMAZING app!!",1
"It's a really good app, but I sometimes find it hard to discover new songs",0
"Spotify used to be great for listening to music. Unfortunetely they are forcing randomized play unless you are a premium subscriber. The premium service offered is worth, at most, $2.99/month, not $9.99",0
"Latest update made app terrible. On mobile the song that is playing is not being displayed in the widgets nor in the app nor in the top slider of the phone. App keeps losing connection and randomly cuts out and picks back up after a few seconds. Really makes me reconsider my 9,99 monthly subscription if i can barely listen to my music",0
After the latest update the app is keep crashing,0
Great app for music.,1
Stupid adds after every single song now. Forget this useless app.,0
I love it plays with not as many ads as people are letting on to believe. My songs I picked. Can't get much better than that!! ðŸ˜‰ ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ§ðŸ—¿ðŸŽ¶. Could not be better,0
This app continues to get worse. Play controls randomly disappear and you have to close the app to get it to stop playing. It also randomly crashes.,0
Okay but not great there are limited skips and it also makes Playlists for you and in general its an okay music app would recommend pandora though,1
"Spotify is the BEST MUSIC APP on the Market! It's available free{w/very limited commercials} or $9.99ðŸ˜ monthly. Considering that you can make your own music playlist - No Limit Doesn't cost to download music/podcast Spotify brings you NEW MUSIC EVERY FRIDAY! PLUS, throughout the year Spotify is constantly making FREE PLAYLISTS for you! {Your Favorite Artist, End of Year Music, Dance Compilation Music etc.} You're the 1st to get NEW MUSIC from NEW ARTIST! They're simply the BEST!",1
"Exciting experience so far. I'm still on my free premium trial, and I'm loving it so far. It's a pity though that a number of African songs do not have lyrics, hoping that's a glitch that will be resolved soon. Otherwise great listening experience and I am smitten by how the app curates customized weekly playlists based on one's listening history!",1
Brilliant especially on Bluetooth,1
The best music app I've used so far. Keep it up.,1
Not working wifi. Please fix it,0
Love the 30 minutes of music at a time without ad's.,1
"The app is brilliant, no doubt. But if we don't get Premium, 100000 ads magically appear and start after EVERY song. Really annoying.",0
"Brilliant app. I use it every day. Wouldn't like to be without it. Lately it been freezing up but, hopefully that'll get sorted in updates.",1
"I've never experienced a musical roller-coaster like the one Spotify takes us everyday and night. Not just music from all over the world, but even music closer to home is available at my fingertips",1
Very topical and interesting,1
It's a good app i can listen what i want hehe,1
Very useful and enjoyable app.,1
"Came back to premium, and it's only disappointing. Playlists and recommended music are a mess. I am a man with many tastes, and there is no logic in how the music is organized. I give more credit to Youtube Music with this. Maybe I would have given three stars if it were possible to reset my account so that I start from scratch, but that is not possible. There is a workaround, but that is definitely not acceptable. When premium expires, I'll go for Youtube Music.",0
Constantly tries to ram music I've never heard or know I don't like into my playlists. Eventually it ended up purely random. I would never ever pay money for an app on the odd chance it might improve the function. I hate this app,0
The worst app ever like i make my own playlist and make it private and he add songs for my playlist ðŸ˜‘ like why do i ask your opinion why do add songs for my playlist and i stopped the auto start of similar song but it keep the same problem and also it does't desreves one star,0
"I am not even overexaterating I got 6 ads in a row and that wasnt even the get 30 minutes of ""uninterrupted listening"" ads. This app directly forces you to buy the premium version. You cannot select a song to play from a playlist. The only way to listen from a playlist is by shuffle. This is literal bs. I'm downloading youtube music instead. Way better app. Update: YouTube music sucks too",0
Love it! Love it! But if the rates continue to rise then I will have to discontinue to pay for premium.,0
Love my Spotify. Wide selection of almost any type of music.,1
"I like spotify a lot. But it glitches, I'll be doing something on my phone and till just randomly stop playing music! And i when i go back into the app it'll start the song over. Please fix this its so frustrating!! It happens often.",0
"Easy to use, transparent app with all music you need.",0
Doesn't work well with heos,0
"I can't get access easily to the songs that I want to listen to When I press ""play"" it play a different song than what I chose!",1
"Completely different from the web version, good sound quality yet any playlist song Is completely random and you have 6 daily skips, can't get around it by playing single songs too. Overall the app is O.K. but the pc/computer web version is way better than the app.",1
It a good app BUT how can I not pick the songs I want to play and only get 6 SKIPS AN HOUR it's so annoying why can't I pick my own songs. So after 6 skips your stuck listening to songs I don't want to listen to at the moment why can't I pick the song like on every other device,0
It can't play music when I ask google assistant to play music on spotify. It always says sorry something went wrong please try opening spotify. Even I linked my spotify with google and as a default music provider. Please fix this issue,0
Best audio quality The music app ever I seen,1
May there are no ads in app,0
Superb This app is Full clash of my dipression I'm happy when I'm install this app,1
I love how it plays in the background and you don't have to pay for that.,1
"Great cheap price. Also got bundled in with Hulu for free. The latest on all the music can find just about anything you want. Podcast for giveaways, exclusive sweepstakes definitely at my highly recommend it",1
Super buggy now. Have to reinstall for new podcasts to come up. Randomly will not have a play/pause strip and have to turn off to stop playback.,0
RECENT PROBLEM the song suddenly stopped. why now spotify has lots of bugs,0
New update has brained it. Stops playing music all of a sudden. No reason. Also the track change / pause option disappears so you have no way of stopping music unless you quit the app.,0
definitely the best app for streaming music & listening to podcast,1
Broken. No video when Bluetooth connected. YouTube way better!,0
"There should just be an explicit filter, instead of two different versions of the song. Incredibly annoying finding a good song and finding out its the censored version.",0
Beneficial whilst having my long bath...listening to History of Rome padcast,1
My spotify is not working from the past week.the app keeps shutting down whenevr I play music I did every thing I was told about whether it's login log out or reinstalling the app but I still face the same problem I want spotify to resolve my issue and help me out.,0
Outstanding music better then Amazon music.,1
Excellent music options,1
"I understand yall need to make money, but 5 Ads in a row is Ridiculous!! (YES I counted and am not trying to trash talk, because besides this it is a great platform.)",1
"""Start a session"" option changed from scanning a code to sending a link that doesn't even send you to the session. Please change this update back please.",0
Verity is available in music genre. Still navigating.,1
No bar to show what song is playing? WHY? Can't skip through song. Start over. Next. I have to go through my phone HUD to see which song is playing,0
Spotify is the best place to listen to the best rap music ever.,1
When you guys add stuff ia so anoying I can't listen to my playlist that I put together because of the stuff y'all are putting in plz fix it I beg you,0
Great listening experience!,1
Works well for the most part. Hangs occasionally with just a few bugs.,1
I like the app. It has good music although it dictates what song I should listen to!! I hate,1
This app SUCKS. When I try to play my music it never does it worse music app,0
Good,1
Great app ðŸ‘Œ but if they could put some more options it would be better,0
Love Spotify I recemend it to all my friends absolutely love the blend play list,1
Unable to login . Says connect to internet every time.,0
I hate when you dont have premium and you can not do more than 6 skips per hour.Like it is your songs you KNOW.,1
I use this app all the time. Got it on practically all my devices. But for some reason it stoped worked. Doesn't load anything. Says all playlist don't have anything in them anymore. And it keeps saying it's offline even though I got internet. Ive tried deleting and redownloading multiple times and it still won't work.,0
"Before the recent update, I had a blast with this app and have been for years. After the update I'm experiencing a bug where the play/pause tab on the notification doesn't respond to any taps and always gives me ""Spotify is trying to play..."" Error. It then leads me to having to force closed the app. Pls fix this!",0
Love the access to a variety of podcasts.,1
The update is SO not it. I would have been way more better like how it was where you could just listen to liked songs and skip as many as you like but now I have to pay and I honestly think that its unnecessary. Then yall even add songs that I didn't want or ask for..so in that case I will rate it at a 3 but it would have been a 5.,0
"Great app, especially with premium.",1
"Nice app smooth must use only music lover, but premium plan charge high.",1
"Excellent for podcasts. Can download in advance. Wish I could easily delete old downloads, but still a fantastic app I use everyday.",1
"I can never get 1 song,it's always a playlist with it,never able to lissen to my playlist without songs I diddnt add playing,whenever I press play it's always on suffer and I never get 30 minutes free of adds",0
The load time is wonderful and very short and you don't have to wait long to hear the next best thing.,1
Good app for listening music,1
If you have a Playlist with 400 songs it only plays a 1/4 of the songs over and over,0
Best music streaming service period.,1
"Love this app to download, search and save the songs I want instead of just randomly on a player that decides for me it great.",1
I hate this app. Its very difficul to open an album and play the music that you want. Its very complicated,0
"I REAL-LY APPRICIATE A GOOD ,EMERGENCY RADII CHANNEL AND OR SPOTIFY EMERGENCY STATION RMERGENCY CHANNEL TURN ON.....I KNOW THAT I SHOULD BE TRIPPING CORRECTLY AND AM COMPLETELY...""SOMEHOW... ...""INVOLVED WITH A VERY BIG ********((((((***)))*****,******************************,***********))))))))SHOWBUSSINESS((((((********************CROWD CONTROL...ANSWER AND TOP,TOP PRIORITY ,AND TOP TOP SECRETS,ANSD SECRET SECRET EMERGENCY...OF AGE,AND TIME,AND...DATES BIOHAZARDS KNEW....THAT,THE SURVELLANCE,A",0
I shouldn't have to force stop an app every time I want it to work properly. I've used the app for years for podcasts and it's always had issues but it's been getting worse recently. It plays without giving an option to stop it or telling me what's playing. I know Spotify has the money to fix it so why has the app been trash for so long and getting worse?,0
"As of late, app has been bugging out. It force closes, takes forever to load, music won't play, navigation is delayed and just feels off. Any updates on this?",0
"Let's just put it this way, if the app doesn't crash more than five times in a day, I call that a win. How can an app have so many updates, yet nothing ever gets fixed?",0
It is a good app but you need premium to listen to what you want to,1
I love setting the atmosphere with exactly what I want to hear and I can do that with Spotify.,1
"Normally it works just fine, but have experienced a lot of crashing lately.. Trying to fix it now. ;)",0
Why dont you add an option like adding lyrics enthusiasts will add lyrics in the respective language then you can have a team or take responses from the listeners asking whether the posted lyrics are right and then you can have a final draft with no mistakes in which we generally find in many of the lyrics,1
I would say it was great 1yr ago but now it is the equivalent to apple music,0
"It's a great app. Only problems many ads, and for me personally the canvas feature isn't working, eventhoguh I've got premium.",0
"Developer's, You collect to much of my personal info, then it states I can delete all of my personal info. I can't delete mine! I just turned phone on. Spotify was playing a show when I didn't turn Spotify on. I uninstalled the application. I want my personal information Deleted! Please fix this. I don't know what Android wear is, but that's the 1st question.",0
"I really love Spotify but at the same time I also love Pandora I have been using Pandora for a while they have 1HR of ad free music Spotify only had 30 minutes of ad-free music so maybe that's something that Spotify can match so speak also I do not like the fact that you cannot scroll back to see who you recently listen to just now I accidentally said I basically didn't like it because this artest cause I pressed some circle with a line through just keep it simple, its a give n take :/",0
Found some old school memories again music I no longer have so 4 stars love this app wish I could save the music of line for 30days let's say..,0
Really Good App for Music,1
"LOVE this app! HOWEVER.... for some reason the application keeps deleting itself. I'm serious, I even downloaded an app to keep applications from being deleted without a password...... STILL deleted itself. This is the ONLY application I have had that kind of issue with on this phone.",0
I love the mix set Spotify puts together for me and I especially love my personalized cat station,1
It's alive it's so much fun all it needs is a vocal librarian and it's good with every hood. This is where music comes alive,1
Spotify is amazing music app... And spotify adds are also kids friendly â¤,1
I can't able to buy premium membership for all plan it show sorry you're no eligible for this plan please solve this problem,0
Its so easy to use and its so awesome bc i get to prank my friends that i was a VIP anyway i found some of my fav songs nice app,1
Seriously... Where is the sort option? First you remove the playlist song order editing option. Now we can't even sort songs in album or artist order. change that and it'll be better,0
The best ! Very pleased with the app,1
When I first joined Spotify it was great but now the advertisements come up about every 2 songs and it's usually 3 commercials at a time. I'll be looking into Pandira or other music apps,0
spotify has introduced me to so much music i never would have found. i should have joined years ago! and i never give a full five stars to anyone. A+,1
"It's good but most of my downloaded music keeps getting deleted over and over again. It's so annoying,I can't even enjoy my music offline",0
"is it just me or not, after got 3 update my audio quality always like got stabbed by a knife. thats hurting my ears.",0
Fix your app I'm trying to play a goddamn playlist but oh the playlist doesn't actually want to play songs that are on the playlist.,0
"This app has a ton of bugs. Especially my music randomly pausing. I use premium, and its great, but sometimes my music playlists will re download, or bug out causing me to reset the app all together.",0
Lyrics are not coming. I even tried to install it again but still it's not working.,0
"Has 99.99% of songs you're looking for... and if your favorite song is one of the .01%, just download it onto your desktop, open up local files on your spotify app and download it to listen to it on your phone.",0
Great music source and ease of use,1
Ads are too frequent which annoys me.,0
Ta kota hug pele ajke Choc day te kota choc pele teddy pelekichu to janalei naaa,1
"The largest selection of music, podcasts and easy to use",1
I was finally able to get spotify premium gift cards back in january so it has been the best music app since then at least where i am at in my interestes right now and i was wondering if you guys at Spotify could make it possible for us out here to be able to rate the songs like the music app jango does?,1
Cost a lot but the service is very good.,1
It's good but certain songs play for acouple seconds and then another song plays another issue I don't like is. If I'm listening to my liked songs I don't want to listen to sounds that aren't in the playlist.,0
Best app for listning songs,1
"Spotify your app had been a buggy mess lately. Click on one song it plays a different one in an entirely different playlist. Constant ""no internet connection"". Sort it out",0
"Had to go back to Spotify Free because Premium was a luxury I can't afford. Being poor is punishment enough without being taunted by awful features of this app. One album I love I haven't heard in entirety for weeks, as if some songs just aren't available. It shuffles in other artists, and plays songs already set to hidden, then the playlist stops before actual completion and I'm expected to start over with songs I've already listened to? Borderline fascism. Spotify are bullies.",0
This is the best music lestening app all songs are available and the playlist feature is amazing,1
App constantly crashes. Fix it.,0
It's amazing app for increase your interest on your work,1
Literally horrible I don't understand why I'm trying to listen to music and ur sitting here playing ad after ad just after one song. And it would be the same ad get a grip,0
This app is broken. I pay for premium and im constantly having to unistall and reinstall because if crashing or glitching,0
Why can't you just let people listen to their songs without have to mess with all of bs that blocks I was just simly trying to listen to a song and then. Listen to songs like it but no instead I get hear the once the I'm completely unable to listen to it if your look for an app to listen to music on pick a different one or just put on YouTube,0
"Shuffling playlist doesn't really randomly shuffle, I've got a 90 hour playlist but I only hear the same songs and same artists over and over again.",0
"I have been using this app for more than a year now and I have no complaints. Even with all the ads, it is a great app for music.",1
The best,1
"Spotify's worthy to my desires, adjusting my moody ways to levels much higher then prior! My only concerns are that I am a traditionalist! When I take time & effort to search for fav songs, SEE those selections on a Playlist, created by me, I'm anticipated to hear em all! Sure, alot depends on how your phone is setup and what service plan you have in order to store it, or better yet, to download it to your memory card. Ahh, my ""worrie~free"" life! Somebody's gotta du it! Ciao..",0
I don't even wanna rate 1 star. Worst cheap App. Can't even Search nor play a song properly.It gets stuck in the middle of nowhere.Even the Ads are so annoying. Uninstalling immediately!,0
I need help!!! My spotify NOT OPEN!!!! PLEASE.,0
"It's basically a pay-to-play platform. Otherwise, you can't pick the specific songs that you want to listen to. It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, but the algorithm sucks and doesn't know how to suggest songs that fit what you're looking for either. Tried it. Deleted it.",0
"Good app for music, too many ads though",0
"I used to listen to Spotify all the time, but now it keeps shutting off in the middle of a song",0
So unreliable and unstable lately. Spotify has been getting worse and worse the past year. Playback stops when I lock the screen and downloaded songs and playlist aren't playable when offline. Time to cancel.,0
This service has allowed me to visit anywhere. All the music I love and forgot about favorites.,1
"App doesn't find nearby devices making it pretty much useless, unless you only listen on your phone",0
"Today, I wanted to listen to one of my playlists. When I started the shuffle, I was greeted with a suggested song not on the playlist. I skipped it, and got a song on the playlist. When the song ended, up got another suggested song. Skip. Song on the playlist. Song ends. Yet another suggested song. Skip. Suggested song. Skip. Suggested song. Why would you give me more suggested songs than those on the playlist? I don't know what you're testing, but you need to cut it out.",0
"most android friendly music streaming app. the reason why i didn't give 5 stars is because there is still room for improvement. The Spotify lyrics need a bit of work and It would be nice to have more exclusive artist content on spotify but all the same, great job!. i really love this app",1
There has been a recent issue where the app doesn't show the playheader after locking phone. You won't be able to skip or pause songs. The only fix is to fully close the app and restart. S22 ultra,0
Nice app,1
telling 30 minute unintrupted song..every after 2 songs ads comes.. uninstalled ta ta..,0
Nothing but positive experiences with this app.. the streaming music is literally endless...,0
Good songs,1
It is becoming hard with every update to listen to songs..i used to love this app but now they are making it really difficult for regular people to listen to songs. What is the point of updating the app in the first place,0
Very helpful if finding new music and genre's and it let's me feel somewhat of a personalized selection when finding music,1
Amazing. background mode possible unlike tubing.,1
It is great when we use this app it has so many songs old and new also so many rap songs it is more diffrent than the other ones i really apreciateðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
"It's pretty great, but it would be better if you make a playlist out of our recently played!",1
good,1
"Cancelling my subscription. I've been experiencing too many issues and been quite about it for too long. I have no idea what is going on now. Music just randomly stops and starts. Oh and the absolute worst! The Now Playing interface doesn't pull up when I start playing a song, so I can't skip replay or pause a track!",0
Play bar disappears constantly! It keeps having bugs the last few days.,0
Needs to have an option to block certain podcasts from appearing on the main screen. I don't EVER want to see the Charles Manson-looking logo for Joe Rogan on my screen EVER AGAIN!,0
They are shutting down free speech. There are programs they don't have anymore. Silencing people is not right. Everyone has a opinion. Opinions deserve to be heard. This app is a joke. I will be going somewhere else,0
"The app is good and all,altho i dont have premium due to finance issues, the adds seem to be getting excessive like 2-3 30 second adds after just 2-3 songs and i used to be every 30 minutes which was acceptable...My other problem is when you play a playlist, altho considerate i wish i could turn off the ""feature"" where itll add songs that i may like because i want to listen to the songs i already have in the list and not have to waste the,considerate, 6 skips you allow nonpremium users. The end.",0
Better collection of songs than gaana or interface is very realistic and smooth color.,1
Really great music app i love itðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ’ž,1
"Saying ""enjoy 30 min of uninterrupted music"".. But ad is loading after every 10 min... Better switch to gaana",0
fix the glitches jfc guys. your budget is way too big for this current glitch that every review is complaining about to continue. you have to know about it. spotify is about to pull a blockbuster if it isn't careful. there's other options that don't have this glitch that makes them borderline unusable.,0
Songs and stuff is okay but soooooooo many ads after a song tbere are not less than 3 looong ads like of 30-40secs each,0
"There has been a bug since the new update came, when I press a song then it gives me a completely different song wich annoys me alot",1
"Stopped using YouTube and went to Spotify. Far less ads, the music is organized and easy to focus on single artists or genres.",0
"The app on my ipad worked really well, the ads were bareable and some features needed premium and I understand. I tried the app on my phone and it was hell, I don't want to be spoonfed songs I don't want to listen to and why the hell would you need premium to loop or even control the song you're listening to. Please make the app worth downloading and maybe give users the ability to even control what their listening to.",0
"New bug; player is not visible in app or notification bar, crashes after a few minutes of playtime. Unusable in current state, please fix.",0
"Spotify meets all your need and music you like to listen to on a daily basis! no matter what Genre, spotify is accessible and available to all and has a great premimuim monthly deal for those who do not like adds and skip songs on the daily.",1
"This music is one out of a million of its kind. I love it, and I'm enjoying it.",1
thank you for creating this app so i can listen to all my favorite music for a cheap price. i love you so much.,1
Amazing music app. I absolutely enjoy using it. The only problem is that it has started pausing songs midway.,0
I love spodify but the only down fall is that they keep adding songs to my playlist which kinda annoys me,1
"Spotify has become the definition of trash. It's filled with glitches, which is especially ridiculous considering the high monthly payment. I honestly wonder if they hired 5 year olds to code this app. An example of one of the many glitches would be, my songs being shown as unplayable when I'm offline, even though I downloaded them.",0
"I used this app to listen to podcasts, but the user interface is not friendly. You can't easily manage old content. I have switched to iheart radio and found it's very user-friendly. I highly recommend iheart over spotify.",0
"Not once have had a problem with Spotify, they are very polite and respectful! Koodos 2 them !! â˜®ï¸ Out.",1
I wanna give Spotify 5 star but lately a lot of my favorites song just gone. Just like that. It became unplayable. The song that mostly not on YouTube. I'm pissed off. I don't know who to blame but I will blame this app.,0
I love Spotify I use it all the time it bring so much joy into my life,1
"This app is crashing on my IQOO Z5 Device after 4 -5 days of installation , please do something !",0
"Broken app, takes forever to load, most content never show, can't play anything, takes forever until I give up... the driving experience is the same, titles don't show or stay loading forever. When I'm lucky enough to get something playing random tracks don't play or just get stuck. Removed 500 times and installed again, works fine for a couple of minutes and then goes back to the same. Unusable on my Android device.",0
"The resent changes make this app just like YouTube Music, but the only up side is that you get a ad every half an hour instead of every song.",0
"Great app, great music, love the weekly custom play lists but only negative thing is the pop aps if it not a primum user",0
Zero star rating as I was facing issues with installation and no one from customer support had a resolution for my issue since 10 days. Very disgusting.,0
Noice app but too many adds,0
I don't like the thing that add sings that u don't want to my playlists,0
I would have given them a 5 only if they made us able to back up or transfer the downloads,0
"I've had Spotify for a long time and it has been overall the best music app I've ever had. I would have hands down given this app 5 stars, but I'm upset with the new update. It used to have a scroll on the side but no longer has it in the new update. I have 1500+ liked songs in my Library, and I now have to scroll through 1000 songs just to get to one song I wanna listen to. Sure, I can search in my Library, but then it won't auto play all my music. -Edit- The scroll is back! 5 stars!",0
Good app for music but I keep getting auto payment even tho I disabled auto update and i can't understand why I contacted help and nobody has answered me for months now I had premium for 2 months and after nothing more but u guys keep taking my money as payment for premium but I don't have any of that functions enabled on my account now what the hell,0
Best streaming service by far.,1
"Love it but could be better, when revisiting playlist or albums to have an option of starting from where we left off, when we last listened.",0
Nice variety of music. I love reggae music. I have been a fan since 1974 when I heard Rastaman Virbration in the record store. I went crazy for reggae music and have been since them,1
I love spotify I just wish it didn't have ads that pops up when I be listening and trying to do my playlist of music I want to listen to,1
Able to get into other apps whilst listening to musicðŸ‘Œ,1
Great music,1
"I really enjoy this app I've had it for about 4 years. It's good for school work and studying. A complaint I have though is that whenever I make a new playlist it will play something totally random its really annoying. the updates suck the app was really good but with all the new updates I hate it. And theres a lot of ads, I feel like I listen to more ads then I do music. Spotify premium was worth it.",1
As am a music lover and really fond of Indian classical and romantic music specially sang by Arijit Singh.. who is currently Spotify's most heard artist.. and for this fact I really loved this app .. The Spotify Original can make my all music dreams fulfill... I also love the fact that it not only supports big singers but also supports small singers like us...,1
Good app... But i would also like to suggest one thing. I would like to see the lyrics of every song without having to swipe up ... It means that i want the lyrics box to stay fixed so that i could see it without having to swipe up for every songs...,1
"In my opinion, I particularly hate this app. I try to listen to an individual song, and it plays random songs! It says it's the individual song, then plays random ones and dosent play the song I want. I don't know if I am doing something wrong, but it bugs me out alot so I am definitely uninstalling this app!",0
It is always showing no internet connection inspite of having good internet,0
I had some problems with it not playing the song I wanted but I found how to fix it just go on your phone then Spotify and do the same on your TV and play one song from your TV and you can play what you want from your phone after,0
Bestest music app to ever exist.,1
"Will knock you offline repeatedly. It should be able to run on mobile network, not be reliant on wifi while at home. Obviously wifi is turned off on Android when you're out of the house. It's just annoying. Driving without music until the app decides to play nice isn't my idea of PREMIUM.",0
"I have been a huge fan of Spotify and a loyal subscriber for years now, but the latest update is a bit of a joke! Whoever thought it would be a great idea to take away playing of our own playlists at our chosen order and force upon us a shuffle mode is clearly keen to lose all this loyalty and monthly subscription not just from me, but judging by the number of complaints here, by many more as well! 1st time ever seriously thinking about leaving ðŸ˜” Fix it please.",0
"This app was awesome at first, you probably always get these cheesey stupid ""At FirSt"" but I'm being honest it was great I would listen to it in class so I couldn't hear my teacher talk all day, after a while it plays random music that isn't related to the music I listen to I click on a song I wanna listen to and it would play a different song, and it's stupid I watch 2 ads and it says ""BlaH bLah here's yo 30 minutes"" you mean seconds? I close and open the app again, poof gone like this app soon",0
Easy to use and can be used nearly anytime,1
I have been using Spotify for 3 years .It's wonderful.,1
Apps been very glitchy lately. Doesn't even show what song I'm playing until I close and reopen the app it's annoying,0
When I press shuffle it shuffles the same songs( no variety),0
I've been using Spotify since 2018- and it's fantastical,1
Good functions well designed,1
This is an nice app for taking musices fun (and happyness).,1
Really great. Love the seldom and short advertisements. Thank you.,1
"I've been trying for so long to find my password by just can't find it on my account, and I can't get my account back in from my Xbox after accidentally gaining out that I was got you 5 so writing and that's the problem. Can you please help me with that?",0
Music quality and algorithm is top notch. But one big issue is the i can't add a song to my queue by searching . The whole menu list is gone ! Whats wrong with you? This is the so far best music streaming service But this one thing is resisting me now from Taking premium!,0
Music is great. Politics not so much. Get rid of right wing podcasts!,1
I tried to open the app and it wont open I restarted my phone but Ill tap the icon itll freeze and then send me to my home screen I uninstalled and reinstalled and that fixed it for a day but now its happening again I dont want to have to redownload everything again,1
No words can express how I love this ðŸ˜â¤â¤â¤,1
"There are way too many ads, and they come in sets of three!",0
This is probably the best music app ever just saying,1
Awesome..... found all my long lost music..and discovering new stuff,1
Amazing it has everything and works so well I love it and even pay for premium,1
"Intermittent audio dropoff with Bluetooth speakers. Any time I use a Bluetooth speaker with Spotify, it starts cutting out. This needs fixing!",0
Best music streaming service!,1
"Spotify is good but premium could be cheaper, other than that it's pretty good, since I use it everyday",1
Group session can't work properly!,0
"Hi ðŸ‘‹. I love Spotify, I received Spotify premium for free for 2 weeks. Thank you Spotify. I found it great and I will still keep using Spotify as is until I get a good feel for the app.",1
"Use it on the daily. THANK YOU for adding the artist/decade/genre mixes, so great",1
I like this app and uses it practically everyday or whenever I need to listen to music only problems is that some of the ads to me are weird but other than that really good,1
"I love it. I can hear my music whenever I want to without interruptions. Thank you,for all you do.",1
Good to got all your music playlist save somewhere!,1
"I'm realizing only the best songs from some albums are unavailable. Is that because spotify can't afford the good stuff? There is a song grayed out in an album. If I google why the song won't play, I get all spotify web pages telling me I can listen right now. But cannot. It is available on other apps, in fact I just found out spotify is the only one with all these particular songs missing. The reason being that in some countries they don't allow certain content. What a sham.",0
"I love it and been using this for so long...I found fresh music, new artist and really enjoy old classic music for nostalgic moment ðŸ˜† ðŸ¤£...I recommend this to y'all â¤ï¸",1
I can turn my music on and it will play all night.,1
"Lately the app is horrible. Crashes, stopping, buggy. Not sure what happened but it used to work great. 2 star for now, will change when it gets fixed.",0
Fantastic range of easily accessed music,1
Great experience. Only issue is with downloading songs. The downloaded songs disappear after 12:00 am.,0
Music to my ears i recommend this all to those who loves music:],1
"I heard a preacher give a testimony once. As he spoke it sounded as if he was still a little kid, meaning he was still learning how to pronounciate certain words.( He was in his 50's ). This of course was due to a very serious car accident he said the only thing that he knew when he woke up is that he loved god and he was greatful for his wife and that he loved god, they both helped him relearn how to live. That's what the music is doing for me teaching me how to live again.",0
Very very interesting app... And a variety of songs like dusk from Tobu and spectre from Alan Walker... I love this app!!! And congratulations for the owner of the app... Well done,1
I like this app veryyyyyy much but I don't like the interuption of ads between the songs,0
Whenever I try to listen to music I get nothing,0
Very Satisfied,1
"Does not care that their download service for songs is broken, been 3 years begging them to fix the download issues. Spotify does not give a damn, moving entire family to another provider that can actually provide the services they claim to offer.",0
I like the app but recently the 'playing now' button keeps disappearing in the app and on my lockscreen. The songs stop playing at random when this happens and I have to restart the app. Reinstalling didnt work.,0
"If I have to download my library one more time, I'm canceling my premium subscription. * I did redownload 6 more times. Enough is enough.",0
"It's more money than I'd like to spend but the ad free unlimited version is worth it. Do wish they would be more understanding with the address verification with family plans as my children travel between my home and my husband as we have been separated. Sucks they don't recognize my son on our family plan bc he's only at my address part of the time. I'd also love if the playlist feature was a bit more intuitive to navigate considering I've had some from back in the ""starred"" era",0
Best easy to use music app,1
"My experience has been bad lately. There is no ""add to queue"" option. The ""go to song radio"" option is also missing. Without these, I think I am really missing out on enjoying the app. I would request Spotify to please fix this bug or roll out help for it because it is really annoying.",0
Before the app was very good but now it is giving so much ads more than songs you will listen here ads now,0
Its great,1
Used to love the app. Still like the content but it crashes all the time. Unable to use the controls most of the time. Tired of uninstalling and reinstalling all the time. Hoping they fix it soon,0
Been having issues throwing music directly onto the TV from the app and using the cast feature and I know it's not my cast device or TV because YouTube works just fine,0
It will not let me listen to Spotify on my phone. 6 people have tried to get it to work and it won't,0
The progress bar of the player keeps getting lost leaving me without an option to see the lyrics or skip and go to the next song. This is happening on this updated version,0
Spotify is good but yall do to many ads for a person try to listen to they music but yall just got way to many ads,0
The app is great !!! It's free (which is brilliant) and while using it feels like a premium music streaming app.,1
Good Music Streaming App. And Affordable To Many Because This App Offer No Auto Renew Subscription. Compare To Other Music Streaming App That Offer Only Auto Renew Subscription Althought There Is Free Trial.,1
Annoying interface and difficult to navigate. Unfortunately shuffle play is always on even with paid membership...,0
"Great for finding alt playlists for your personal tastes and absolutely great selection of music in general, but for some reason it randomly decides to completely restructure certain playlist radios based on your listening history. That, and the ever-annoying Bluetooth access control pop-up. Literally feels like I'm being harassed for my Bluetooth device data. I'm already paying for Premiumâ€”leave me alone!!! Also, despite paying for Premium, there's no way to hold listening history betw devices.",0
Brilliant app. I use it all the time. The only thing wrong with it is that for phone users the music is stuck on shuffle if you don't have premium. If you removed this it'd make the app better to use. Otherwise it's a handy thing to have.,0
"I can't shuffle through my own liked songs at all, without it playing the same 10 over and over. And I am literally getting 7 ads in a row, before I can listen to one song. Plus, this app is confusing to use.",0
"As of late this app has had the most annoying random pause or full out crash during podcasts. It will continue to play on my phone once I've left the car, with no pause or stop features available. I use to close all running apps to get it to shut down. Completely unacceptable for a service I pay for. I'm seriously considering discontinuing my subscription.",0
"The app glitches and doesn't show the now playing. I will be switching to Tidal soon, for better functionality and quality.",0
"This app has over a 100 songs but there's still a lot of songs,albums and even podcasts that it is missing. If there's an app that has lot's of songs I want A LOT. Also why is there so many blocked songs like time/Breathe reprise by the flaming lips. Some of the missing songs are time travel YES...!! by the flaming lips on at war with the mystics and the divel went down to Georgia by primus on rhinoplasty. The adds are not a problem which is good .",0
Ten,1
Leading the way in free speech protection and has all the good music,1
Awesome Experince!! Waiting for more feature update,0
I love this app but it can be butter with less ads,0
Listening to the music is okay sometimes you just are curious as to who an artist is but you don't want to follow the artist and you don't want to play that music from the artist after you listen to it once and you may be curious what is the big deal about a podcast but that doesn't mean that you want to follow a podcast it's called curiosity and you can't get rid of the things that you searched for or the history even though you were just curious so they continue to pop and it is annoying.,0
"Lyrics still doesn't work for me, I hope the next update will fix this.",0
"Please, please just like me listen to the music before adding it too a Playlist the new update has made my life hard. I miss the old Spotify.",0
"Tis good, I prefer some older features for the desktop version tho",1
still buggy after all these years,0
IT ALWAYS PICK ANY SONGS NOT MY FAV WHEN I PRESS MY FAV SONGS IT KEEPS PICKING RANDOM UGH IM JUST GOING TO DOWNLOAD PURETUBER YOU SUCK!,0
Now playing doesn't even show up half the time. Have to restart the app for it to show up again. Notification to control songs disappears. And NO 2 FACTOR AUTH?,0
I.hate.the.new.update. When I play my playlist I can't even pick what song I wanted to hear first but it will quickly shuffle!! Instead of relaxing listening to music it makes me frustrated even more!!!... Hope you can fix it!!,0
"I love it. Huge songs collection of any style music. High quality files and amazing softwere detecting the sound you like and giving you good recommended music for your preferances. App organised really well, it is a pleasure to use it. So thankful that Spotify exists and evolves.",1
"I'm not sure what happened but the app has become unusable. I'm stuck on a loading screen everytime I open the app and it has frozen my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 multiple times. It also always says ""no internet connection available"" when I am connected to the internet. I tried clearing cache, reinstalling, but nothing worked. Theres lots to fix.",0
"App was fine until I purchased premium membership. Free version shoes ads after every 30 minutes which is okay but when I purchased Premium subscription for a day to try premium, ads popped up after every 2 songs which was like 5-7 minutes. At first I thought it'd be a glitch but even after relaunching the app same thing happened which spoiled party ridiculously. I am glad I din't purchase monthly or yearly package. Whoever thinking to buy premium membership, DON'T GO FOR IT AT ALL. TRY GAANA.",0
It's a really great app. I love how fast they update the songs and playlists and all that but a dislike button would be nice. So that when songs are disliked there not only remove from playlists and also not suggested in another playlists.,0
"Podcast stops playing several times everyday, app basically closes. Doesn't show what I'm listening to at times during podcasts",0
Ive always had countless ui problems with this app but with that said it will always be my main music platform. I just love the look and the layout of it.,1
I like Spotify ,1
Spotify connect seems to be very glichy. Volume control via other devices cant be turned off no matter the options you toggle. Volume jumps all over the place when using other devices randomly.,0
"Last week the app shuts down music randomly, doesn't show which song is playing, along with no option to pause. Constantly skipping, even on full 5G bars. I've tried on 2 different devices, and both have the same issue",0
This last update has made spotify so frustrating to use. specifically with android auto as the app can only load music about 30% of the time when connected,0
In this new update i can't share links of the songs don't know why it is happening but it's very irritating,0
"New update on group sessions has ruined the experience, since the scan to join feature has been removed it is difficult to join plus the option to choose whether I play through my device (as a session member) or only through the hosts device is now gone so any member has to have their divice muted the whole time. I understand this feature is still in beta so hopefully this can be resolved.",0
Completely broken theres a bug when i play songs the player doesnt show up on my status bar and in the app i cant pause or go to next song i reinstalled the app didn't fix the issue,0
I love this app but after about a month of using it there was more adds. And you also couldn't pick just one song to listen to you had listen to an entire playlist all though i like because you can make your own playlist with all your favorite songs on it and you can pick from different types of playlists,1
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNTIL THEY FIX THE PROBLEM WITH ANDROID, this has been going on for weeks. Spotify will not start. I have tried everything that has been suggested and I pay for a premium subscription.",0
"This app has become a problem, issues are popping up everywhere. My issues are different: 1st issue is that it takes forever to open, 2nd issue is that it keeps saying ""no internet connection"" where I have full signal, 3rd issue is that it will randomly crash, 4th issue is that it buffers constantly (I've had to put it to offline mode to correct this). This App needs to be fixed otherwise people will move elsewhere",0
"This is a great app! But only if you have the premium version, the free version is awful and I hate this app for it! Spotify sucks. DO NOT GET!",0
I love it but all tho 6 skips ain't enough,0
"No matter what mood your in, you can find the perfect song on Spotify.",1
"Great music, good choice.",1
It keeps buting random songs in my playlists and in the songs i like,0
Hate the update can't even play the music you really want to listen can't skip playing.. And clicking that specific song gives you random shuffle music to listen.. I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO CHOSE A MUSIC TO PLAY,0
"A few UI changes need to be made, more bugs need to be fixed and a few network issues still need to be addressed. Overall a pretty good app except they of course need to pay artists more for THEIR work.",1
Great selections when after listening to my favorites.,1
"I love spotify but, when ever I use the search button it shows a blank screen for 5 minutes and then closes the app",0
"It was nice but I wished I could get Korean lyrics in romanised form . Other than that I would say , this app is more than awesome . The whole hard work to make this app should be highly appreciated . But there are mannnyyyyy ads which I personally don't like . Also, the app always needs network which is why I cannot listen to music if I don't have wifi",0
Very awesome app every kind of song I like has it on Spotify and its a really incredible app I'm happy that there are no issues with the app it's fine,1
It's constantly crashing and the bar with the options to pause and play music keeps disappearing,0
"I made the switch from another service years ago and have not looked back, it was an easy transition , I find premium duo worth it so my kid and I can have our own accounts and play music at the same time",1
There making the songs worst by removing cuss words but other than that it's a five star â­,0
I love this app. I use it daily. Only reason for not giving 5 star review is that you have to pay to get add free and skipp songs as you please.,1
I love this app because you can play any song you want and it is awesome. Thank you Spotify!!!,1
The Spotify app is more user friendly.,0
Offline play is a real pain... How hard is it to play a downloaded podcast really?,0
Just started using Spotify! Love my Playlist for driving and exercising. Lots of great tunes!!!,1
"Update: I have to say, support was spot on. They answered and solved my problem immediately. So I'm giving back 2 stars. If you have a premium account, though, pay exactly on time. But if there is a free option for this app, why do I have to be locked out of my account if a payment is late? Also, a lot of people seem to be having problems. The apps can't keep up with the newer phones because they're all different and designed to do what you needed an app for. Oh well. Onward and upward.",0
"Of coarse I was misled, you can't pick a song from ur Playlist and listen to it. You have to play the whole Playlist. Just another effin joke",0
I use Spotify mainly for music and it's just an awful app on a technical level. Features are randomly excluded or included on different platforms. I constantly get logged out on my phone deleting all my downloaded music. Literally got on a plane with 1 album recently because of this garbage. Figure it out. Like Netflix this barely qualifies as usable. Also stop scamming artists with your awful contracts,0
Player is gone from lock screen. I've given this app all the permissions it needs and all my lock screen settings are correct. I hate having to unlock my phone to skip songs. Please look into this.,0
"In the beginning spotify was amazing, genuinely 5 star experience with the podcasts, selection of music, and UI. The reason I gave a 1 star is because now that I have an issue with the UI, everything else struggles with it. I can't even watch podcasts in full screen and the music player icon panel is always pushed together like it has a phone aspect ratio. Which doesn't make sense because it worked perfectly before on my tablet. And yes I tried resetting, removing cache, but no help. Please fix",0
"Definitely THE best music player I've ever had/used. I've been using Spotify for years now. Pandora is okay-ish and YouTube is generic and everyone used it, that and the ads are annoying as hell. Spotify premium is one of, if not, the best to use for your music needs. 100%",1
Im starting to hate Spotify because it starting to play random songs that I have no interest in in my playlists and I can't even choose which song I want to play in my Playlist now,0
"Love Spotify Premium. It's affordable, I can listen from all my devices, and I get showtime as a bonus!",1
Update Extremely Bugged. Please revert to old update. Search bar isn't formatted and is cut off. Can play music but doesn't actually visually show any song was selected.,0
It's getting harder and harder to hear the songs I want without resorting to paying for premium. I'm currently looking at other streaming options because I'm so fed up with shuffle play.,0
The app keeps doing this thing when a song is playing where I can no longer see the play/pause bar at the bottom of the screen. It disappears out of nowhere! I uninstall and reinstall the app then it works again. Very annoying!!,0
"Sometimes, it'll make my phone crash but overall.....the best music app and now, my only music app on my phone ðŸ‘â¤ï¸",1
"i would like to request to be given the option to watch ads in exchange for temporary premium features. for example, sometimes it allows you to watch an ad to get 30 minutes uninterrupted. i would like that to be a permanent option and to be able to do it at all times, not only when the app suggests it. i think that would be a lot more useful than the boring ""become premium"" ads. and that way the company can even make money with their ads, since they are offering publicity.",0
All I do is listen to music all this app is the best,1
Have never had any problems with Spotify. Absolutely love it!,1
Ultimately I'm cool with ads with a free account. But to not allow me to choose a song on my playlist is low af. Focing me to shuffle play or buy premium to listen to songs on my playlist that I'd like. But end result is you lost a customer not gained one.,0
Nice sound but need to improve sound like apple music. Does it possible for you guys.,1
"The Worst App of All Time I hate this app more than any app I have ever used in my life. It rarely works, it almost always fails to connect properly to any other app. It always plays from the same song whenever I hit shuffle and I can't control it from my car 10/10 times unless I delete and reinstall the app. If there were another app I could use, I would. Do not recommend. Can't wait for something better to exist so I can delete this forever.",0
"I love this app, I've used it everyday for almost 8 years now. It has its bugs every so often, but it runs smoothly the major of the time abs is well worth the membership.",1
"Great app! Should consider versions of songs by the same artist in your filters so they do not always show up as ""suggestions"".",0
Spotify is a very lovely App,1
"It would be 5 if it easily let me play the song, when I search up a song it takes me to a playlist and plays somethong different. it takes me like 10 minutes to play the song I want.",0
I love the Spotify platform. I get to choose what truths I believe in no matter what podcast I'm listening to.,1
I love the selection of songs available. I've been using Spotify for the past few years and I still love it.,1
"I just Love Spotify. It has every single song/music that is, was, and will be a part of my life's music repritoire. Thanks for supplying such a great array of listening pleasures, SPOTIFY!!",1
Better than Apple music ðŸ’— Been using spotify since 2011 ðŸ¥°,1
Superb tracks some of which I had not heard before,1
East or West now WYNK music is best,1
Good app but now there is a big bug in this app We open a song but it play a different song everytime This is a very bad problem Please fix it,0
"Your recommended songs at the bottom of a playlist feature is completely broken. It only recommends songs that are either already in my playlist or genres and songs that I would never have in my playlist. It also never has new songs in it, every time I go to it it's the same songs as last time, refresh after refresh, it's always the same songs as last time. Please fix it.",0
Been using spotify for 6 or 7 years and had all together a year or more of premium. Was a great app but now I'm literally getting ads every 2 songs. So I can't recommend it anymore.,0
I am a premium user and I have been trying to login on the app for last half an hour. It either gets stuck or the app goes blank. What the hell is wrong with you Spotify??,0
Just brilliant !! Never fails,1
"Many times it doesn't allow to pause. Have to restart. Annoying, especially if I'm PAYING.",1
"Great, but I feel the rudeness when your premium service ends is unmatched... know how to talk to your clients, I left premium and uninstalled,,,a very good app though for music lovers",0
"Cutting out all the time suddenly, I know I'm not alone...also keeps asking for Bluetooth permission, it's been granted 50 times now, fix please",0
Right now I'm trying to play my fav song on this app yknow it just starts at the end it didn't even started at the start of the lyrics plus I can't play my fav songs in my playlist it just plays a different songs pls fix this F you Spotify bring back old Spotify!,0
Good,1
"UPDATE: Also just got ALL my music and podcasts deleted for at least second time. Just very very annoying. Nice that spotify tells which artists are my favourite, obviously I need to be reminded because I don't know that myself. but what's wrong with alphabetical order of all your songs or artists? Some things are better to keep simple",0
Just an overall great music player filled with tens of thousands songs and artists to choose from and hey the free version is great as well so what if you have a 30 sec commercial cause after that then you got half an hour of un interrupted music. 5 ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ Oh did I mention you get 6 free skips .. yes I think better than pandora,1
Great song choices.,1
I don't know why they changed the option to heart a song on the locked screen. It was really helpful,1
"Great music app, always listening to it, the ads can take some getting use to but other than that, perfect.(works best on platforms that aren't your phone because your phone only let's you shuffle play but xbox spotify for example you can listen to in any order you like.)-also bo Burnham songs keep being unplayable, some weird glitch but not too bad, Hope this rating helps :)",1
"You got to get premium is the best and also sound quality has every song. I search for a song , it pops right up you can also share your playlist you creat w friends",1
Great UI but needs some major performance/stability improvements ASAP!!!!,0
App is broken. Stops playing randomly and/or play controls disappear from UI. As a premium user this is very poor form.,0
"Great app and has worked flawlessly until the last update or so where the bar for the music to stop or play is gone and the only way to get it back is to close the app and re open it, as well as my device not being able to recognise that if there is any media playing and at random times the music will just stop and start at random times. Please fix",0
"Has stopped showing the ""now playing"" bar so I can't control the music at all, and keeps randomly stopping/starting playback",0
Not playing properly on bluetooth devices ie songs not showing as well as unable to cahnge song on the bluetooth device itself. Now playing isnt showing up on the bottom so i have yo force close the app or turn off bluetooth to get music to stop playing.,0
"Great selection of music, app works great apart from the app doesn't want to transfer downloads to my SD card. That might be my SD card, might not.",1
Very great app I would of like it 5/5 if it wasn't for that problem like why do you guys add songs recommended for are Playlist like I hate that man,1
My experience with this app has been good so far. You not only play your favourite songs but the app also recommends songs you can listen to based on your song listening history.,1
"The app does not load artist images and album, and song art properly pages often appearing blank, this never happened previously.",0
I used to love spotify but lately it crashes every time i listen. It often plays music but there is no tab to control what plays or even see what the song is. Hopefully they fix it soon,0
I liked it because it has amazing songs,1
I am a premium user and have been using it since 2 years. Autoplay which allows to play similar songs of the same gener after the end of the song is not working. Every time I have take out phone and search and play the song which is more annoying. Not even a worth of single star. ðŸ‘Ž,0
The app just freezes up doesn't let me skip or go back to a song. I'm not sure why I'm using the s22 ultra and when I had my other phone it worked perfectly now it doesn't,0
Good,1
I have a suggestion for this app. If you can have something to customize the home screen and change preferences that should do. The premium Plans are useful for uninterrupted listening.,0
Very awesome app very easy to use,1
Love...no other words to say..Spotify is my go to music app and has been for years ...,1
Sungguh sangat mengesankan dan PERFECT!! You should buy a premium account to be able to access a whole music that you want!! Amazing.,1
"Where had the pause and stop display gone? Can skip to next track, or anything without having to close the app on the mobile. Why has this been changed? Is not improved it at all",0
Spotify is a great app like i can listen to my fav artist like nba youngboy and kay flock and many more,1
"What was once a great app has now got me looking at taking my service elsewhere for streaming. Giving it the benefit of doubt as it's only just started to fault since my s10 has decided to update multiple times in a matter of what seems like weeks. The continuous pausing of songs and lack of information about whats playing, and ability to press play again is super annoying. The slowness and lack of the app wanting to actually play songs has me thinking if spotify is really worth the hassle.",0
I was a regular YouTube user. Not anymore Spotify you dominate my head phones!! !!!,0
"I pay for this monthly and the streaming quality is bad, sync between computer and phone is bad, sync in discord is really bad with the other person being behind, sync with my own profile is bad too, because liked songs on my PC wont pop up as liked on my phone. Really bad app tbh",0
Embedded undesirable songs that do not allow me to play my favorites library.,0
Alex O244,1
_Offline_ features barely work when my internet connection is unstable. This is absolutely annoying. A music player app should really not get in one's way of simply listening to downloaded songs...,0
"Abouslty love it! But just one problem before i had one ad and then 30 minutes without ads but now its 3 ads, is it a glitch? Well its still an amazing app! ðŸ˜ƒ",1
I rlly like this app but when its update i cant play my fav song and i rlly hate the new update so pls work with it,0
Absolutely love Spotify. I use this app all day every day! Music is life â¤ï¸,1
Excellent range of music from all decades,1
It's almost impossible to listen to the music anymore. What has happened? It is lagging all the time. Are you planning to fix the performance or it's time to move to some other paid music streaming service??,0
cmn pgn buat pamerin status dc ajabiar keren,1
"Best app ever â¤ðŸ’œðŸ’– I've been searching an app to listen music from a long time finally I got this and I love this app. It's amazing. It have all type of music like kpop,pop,...etc",1
5/1/22 I'm a paid subscriber. I can't preview the song before I download it. If this don't get fixed asap I'm deleting my account.,0
"I like Spotify , but it has so many glitches , they seem to get fixed and then reappear and Spotify isn't quick to fix these glitches or inform you about any problems .",0
Can't find hidden song that are not saved in playlist,0
"Spotify is the only app I listen to music from, it's really good. But a couple days ago I've been experiencing some bugs with the app. When I play music it bugs out and doesn't show up on my phone or in the app, but I'll be able to hear it. Also when I try to shuffle my songs it doesn't play my songs that are in my shuffle, and the music will cut out while it's playing. I hope y'all can fix these issues.",0
"Lots of bugs. The play/pause button keeps disappearing and you have to restart the app to get it back. Please fix this asap, it is very annoying. Does not connect to my Google home well, glitchy and sometimes skips songs and replays them again.",0
The app is amazing but in a playlist they add random songs the that says recommend for you can you please do somthing about it please,1
It's really good for all my favorite songs I think it's the most superior music app,1
Great sound quality. Great song collections. Always fun hearing Spotify while driving my car.,1
"Awsome, but sometimes when i go offline for some few minutes some of the songs can't be played",0
Song pauses for a while while turning on the screen,0
Way to many ads,0
Easy to use and find songs  and artists the app is very easy Just name the artist or song and in a few moments you will get it Very happy with spotify,1
"Spotify was great at the start, but two major features are still not available after years of user complains : 1) remove an artist from any radio/playlist 2) chose which language you want for podcasts",0
"Usually love Spotify, but recently been having problems with it! After about 15 minutes of playing something it just cuts off, radio silence. When opening app, it takes a long time to respond, doesn't show you what you were listening to so end up having to find episode/song and play from beginning. The other day the whole app just wouldn't open at all?? Something has happened in the recent updates that has made it really buggy and laggy.",0
"Switched from youtube music to spotify for podcasts. There are things I miss from YouTube music, but I still enjoy spotify and it just takes some learning is all. It's a great app for music.",1
Of course its good but the way it takes over my cars bluetooth and wont let go no matter what you do is a HUGE issue. Why does it auto play every time? Just make it stop. Horrible horrible issue.,0
Really good! But it's so annoying when you've hidden so many songs by this one artist and the system (That puts in random songs) still hasn't figured out that you don't want to hear anything by that person,0
"First time not opening the app, bad app",1
"Problem with the app. Good app n nicely working, but whenever I connect my earpodes it starts playing automatically. If I connect earpods doesn't mean I want to play songs everytime.",0
It amazes me that an app like this can have four stars why do I have to connect online after I download an episode why do I have to use data to see in episode that I've already downloaded that seems to me like a bunch of BS. So I'm like you know this sucks is somebody that only has two gigs of data per month. I'm just starting to hate the internet sooner or later you'll be gone and you'll be forgotten and nobody will remember you but I don't remember the hate for your data usage,0
This is the best songs watching app ever,1
Day to day the ads are increasing,1
Love this app but it's bugging out the last month or so. It randomly won't show the play bar and I have to force stop and the open (at least once a day) and it also just randomly stops playing when I'm connected to by earbuds (not quite as often but it's still annoying). Please fix!,0
"Free version of Spotify is awful now, instead listening to add to get 30 minutes of music you get two songs and over a minute of ads. Also premium keeps going up in price it's a waste of money at this point",0
garbage app for listening to music if you're not a premium user.,0
Spotify gives amazing music experience. All playlists are so good and give goesbumps. I love this app,1
It also includes songs of different strings.,1
Awesome and you can listen to anything you want for cheap,1
Once I'm offline for a while my music dissapears and I can't listen to anything until I go back online.,0
The best music streaming app with well organised playlists.,1
This music app is great and has so much to offer from classics to fresh new songs I've never heard of. I use it every day.,1
The only problem is that I can't remove songs that I don't like from the home menu.,0
Updates have been problematic. Most recent update has caused the play controls and song banner at the bottom of the screen to disappear if you back out of the app. Forced restart is the only way to get it back.,0
good. please make free users to be able to play at least 5 songs of their choosing a day before the random playlists,0
Spotify is the best.,1
My Daily Energizer ,1
The new update is just horrible I don't like the fact that I NEED TO PAY TO LISTEN TO WHAT I LIKE it's absolutely infuriating and the offline update? You never did it unless you go back to the old update then the one star is all you get,0
The best music app since Napster! Lol. But seriously it's a great app.,1
Nice no ads,0
Please update the play button at music it hard to play the music if i don't know how to use it,0
Love this app! Has all the music I love and some I haven't thought about in years popped up!,1
This sucks without premium you can't even listen to your favorite songs and it's stupid it's plays songs that you don't even want,0
You give sooo many ads...can't even listen to songs peacefully,0
Love the Playlist,1
Great selection and I put together a wonderful playlist,1
It lets me listen to songs when my phone is off,0
That will be great if this app can add set to default repeat one song only,1
What happened??? I can't pause it anymore. When I play something I don't get any of the buttons showing up on my phone. I can't pause and it won't even show what I'm listening to. I've even had it play right over other apps like books. It's become complete garbage.,0
It's easy music to listen to what you like only wish that it didn't work with WIFI...then it would be absolutely beautiful to have music even when WIFI or DATA ain't available,1
"Same problem as everyone else. Cutting out, won't switch off, no play bar. Needs to sorted and quickly. Cheaper apps available.",0
Latest improvements are full of bugs. #annoying,0
Wide variety of music for different moods,1
"This is my go to music app, I have been using Spotify for about 10 years now and it's still just as good as it was when I first started using it if not better",1
Of all my subscriptions this will be the last I ever leave. All my favourites and lots to discover ranging across all genres including podcasts and more in one place and ad free - incredible.,0
"Need a little development like the app is so boring and if you want some advice on the design Contact me I will do it for for 10$ and if you implement it I want 1500$, deal? Is fun you know.",0
It's the best app to hear music,1
So many more issues than good things to say. Do not reccomend New podcasts will not play and songs will constantly randomly skip or just not play at all. Sometimes it'll play and not be able to be turned off. Just a hassle to deal with. I'll try something else,0
It just stops working in between on mobile data. Everything else works on it but Spotify keeps showing it's offline and there's no internet connection. Tried everything and it still won't recognise my cellular data.,0
Spotify has all the music I need,1
Good app for listening song,1
Soooo many ads...... quick tip: quit your app when an ad plays and reopen it to no ad. Works well,0
5 de Diya hu ab achha Karo Spotify,1
"False advertising- ""30 minutes ad-free"" There are ads every two or three songs, so the claim at the beginning that I can listen for 30 minutes without advertising is false. I timed how long between ads-- exactly 7minutes, not your flasely claimed ""30min ad free""! This would be illegal under Australian consumer law FYI.",0
To be honest this app is the best bro i swear like its so filping good theres all songs u want to listen to,1
"I really enjoy Spotify. It's only real drawback are the ads. I understand the necessity, but some (many) podcasts play the same ad up to three times IN A ROW. Extremely annoying.",0
"Jan2022 update is terrible! seems like Spotify won't play in background and always pauses until i reopen app to resume, or freezes and have to restart podcasts fml!! I've checked my settings and it should work in background, worked great before last update! :(",0
It is a good aap but from last 2 days i was not able to play any song...then i uninstalled it and reinstalled it any i can not even login now...it shows u have no internet connection...i have even downloaded the lite one...not working too ....please Spotify something....i have to hear my playlist and my favourite songs.... please do something And solve my problem... I even have full data pack and tbh i even have a wifi but it is not working....do something immediately and solve my problem.....,0
I really enjoy my day to day life with Spotify its best for me.. ðŸ’œ,1
The design of the app is a disaster. I recommend YouTube music for anyone on mobile.,0
I enjoy the music selections they have and I enjoy the ability to wake up to some of my favorites music. I just lay there and enjoy the music I have selected. Adios for now my friend.,1
"App won't load downloaded music without internet connection. Queue system is designed poorly. My upcoming music is a ""playlist"" with a ""queue"" nested in it? So I add a song to play next (starting a queue) but once the song is over it disappears. If I hit back it plays the song from before the one I added specifically. Garbage.",0
So while i was listening i relized that whenever i choose a playlist it plays random plus after evry song there are ads and i don't like the other songs like whaaat the only reason why i don't wanna play those songs you picked is bc i DON'T LIKE THEM!! And now i cant replay the songs i miss the old spotify:(,0
Least user friendly app ever. Barely works without WiFi even when I've downloaded songs and podcasts. Just bad.,0
"I love this app been using it for years but man, if I say I don't like a song on the enhanced option why would you give it to me again after a few songs....",0
"It's simple to use. A good price for all the music in the world you could possibly want, or ever be able to listen too... Podcast's too. If your into that. It's a win, win, & Always win. If ya like music. I tried a buncha apps over some time. I always find myself back to the spot! 5 stars because.",1
I love it,1
"Totally useless app, they have a shuffle feature, which is so annoying, and you can not get back to your previous song , i mean seriously, the owner company of this app is just money greeders, only if u choose a premium plan then you can play any song , otherwise they shuffle the playlist,and you will never be able to play your favourite song, also the track line of the songs doesn't work, so you cannot skip the in unnecessary part of song, i wish i can give 0 star to this app .",0
The latest update messed something up. My Bluetooth devices can't pause play or skip tracks sometimes. If I kill and reboot the app it's fine but it's annoying to do that every 10 minutes,0
"My Verizon Security on my phone is telling me that my Spotify app using up too much battery has malware in it and wanting to crash and interrupt other apps could you please try to fix the problem for me. I would appreciate it very much, thank you so much",0
"I'm not sure if this is from a recent update or what, but now, whenever I leave my car, the music will continue playing on my phone and ALL CONTROLS have disappeared. They disappear from the whole app when it is launched, disappeared from my lock screen preview, and disappeared from the top drop-down menu. This is incredibly frustrating as it now requires me opening the app settings in Android and doing a 'force stop'. Galaxy A71 on Android 11.",0
Love the app but i have a small issue. I Haven't figured out how to shuffle my playlist. I can't figure it out. I don't see the option at all.,0
"Always great , just adding the fact that if i had less Bill's basically >family man< , so but ya I'd absolutely pay for the premium Spotify, it for sure Kicks some you know what a--ss Never mind 5 stars how about 6 Thanks Spotify for also supplying the free streaming service much appreciated ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ŒâœŒâ˜ï¸ðŸ¤™ ðŸ‘ ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›",1
"Can someone tell me why spotify keeps opening itself even though I've denied all permissions, restricted the app, etc? I don't allow it to run in the background specifically because it opens itself and slows my other apps down. And now it's opening in spite of me denying those permissions????",0
I love this app. I play it for hours at home. The playlists they make for me are pretty spot on. I have even discovered a few new artists!,1
"I love Spotify, Really good app, but its very annoying when i make a playlist and it plays songs i didnt add. I dont like that at all.",0

"Currently on a free trial and might decide not to continue for paid subscription, the app is crushinv everytime I play a music.",0
An amazing app but if you dont have a sort of premium it can get annoying because you can only skip 6 songs an hour and they throw in random rings ever now and then,0
"Songs very good but these 3, 4 weeks it is creating very irritating cause each and every song ending contain advertise ments it's very difficult and bad experience listening ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜”",0
The ad system is alright you get an ad after 30 minutes. BUT!!! You get 3 ads. One 30 second ad and 2 10 second ads. I have a bunch of songs that i have liked and are saved to my favourites and somehow songs i haven't favorited ended up there. Please fix this.,0
Not very good there are so many interuptions in listening,0
Can't remove podcasts from the app. Highly sought after feature.,0
10 outta 10 I wouldn't change a thing Spotify is amazing ðŸ™Œ,1
Nothing but the best app,1
I would give 0 stars if I could. Spotify is both my least favourite app and service of all time. It is absolutely unusable and fails me in every way imaginable. I cannot accurately describe how much I detest it. Every single feature is a literal joke because absolutely none of them work as advertised. If you have worked or currently work on this app you have failed as a developer and should consider other career paths. I pay for this service and you spit in my face.,0
Could you please enable to see who liked my playlist,1
Love Spotify. I love that you can listen to the audio while the screen is off. Other platforms don't allow you to shut off the screen and thw audio still plays.,1
Blank screen during vidoes Vidoe doesn't work for podcast.,0
"Don't know whats updated recently but I am constantly having to restart the app, on my Galaxy tab and phone, the music player function seems to be the issue.",0
"Excellent service, much better than iheart.",1
"Bugs and countless UX flaws would be acceptable in the case of a free or open source app. For an app with the monthly fee, this feels like a joke. Plus the suggestion mechanism is rather poor.",0
The ads are disturbing but the overall experience is nice,1
"App will not connect to internet. Can access the app and log in, but can not play music. ""Something went wrong"" cleared cache, cleared data, uninstalled, reinstalled. Nothing.",0
Best app for listening songs from my pov.,1
Spotify lags a little bit but the most annoying part of this app is that everytime I play a song I suggest it's keep putting a different song and not the one I am looking for and its very frustrating. Please fix this issue I would be appreciated ðŸ™,0
"I can't play music, my playlists won't show up, and if it shows up it just has one song. I installed 3 times if it still 'stuck' like before and yes it is. I hope this getting reply. Edit: these past week I can play music and songs in my playlist aren't gone anymore, Thank you Spotify for fix it.",0
This app is really very nice and also has new songs on the go but the only thing I hate about this app is the amount of ads we get to see if we are not a subscriber but overall the experience is very nice,1
This app has been on of my favorites but recently I've had a lot of issues with the app. Sometimes it won't let me skip songs and it keeps glitching! Spotify fixes these issues ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,1
"went to listen to music, and found out that all my songs got deleted from my playlists",0
Been running really slow for about 2 weeks now.....saying know internet too.......Amazon music maybe the way ahead,0
Samsung s10 trying to get premium and it keeps logging me out and saying not available oops try again.,0
"Still a bit glitchy, but working much better! Great app.",1
Your country is good for Islam and we don't accept that and you too had Arabic music and it was deleted Your country is good for Islam and we don't accept that and you too had Arabic music and it was deleted,0
The newest update is making the app almost unusable. No controls to play/pause or skip. Please revert back to the old update or I'm going to delete the app.,0
"It's really ridiculous, I don't have the lyrics feature and it's just so idiotic idk why i deleted app, i uptaded 3 or 4 times but nothing i don't understand seriously it's driving me crazy",0
"It's a quite good app, but there's a problem with updating. Every time I try to update it, it just won't. Otherwise, it's pretty helpful and functional",0
Hifi Lossless quality audio streaming has to come,0
"Not showing what songs I'm listening too, can't view queue, can't speed forward the song, very dissapointed app updated too",0
When it says its going to give me 30 mins add free it gives me an add after that song,1
Pleasure to listen too. Nice music ðŸŽ¶,0
"Ive been using spotify for awhile but recently Ive been having issues with it pausing and playing on its own, switching songs on its own its completely out of my control! Ive tried unintalling and reinstalling to no avail. Its frustrating to not being able to use the app at all because of this.",0
"I've been using this app for years and have never found much issue in it. Though over the past month or so there has been an ENORMOUS increase in glitches and bugs that causes the app to crash. Please fix this. I don't want to have to switch music players, but I will if things don't change. (Edit) Issues still not fixed.. and more problems are showing up too. I'm VERY close to deleting the app and switching music players. And I know for a fact that other people are too.",0
The restrictions placed on the mobile app that aren't present on desktop are frustrating.,0
I can never get it to play my playlist if I try and click on it it will play music close to it and I didn't want that I've been trying so hard on the mobile app and it just sucks please fix it it's super annoying and I am never downloading this app ever again I do not recommend,0
"Music arrangement is good.Though when one chooses an album for a specific artist, one still finds other artists' music in there.",1
Good app .but full of ads if you don't buy premium you can't hear a song . Now i don't like this app its very bad .if there was half a star i will give this app that . If you remove ads it would be better,0
"The app is really faulty offline. Even though I have downloaded my playlists, they still don't load when I'm not connected to the internet. I have to close and reopen the app at least 2 or 3 times.",0
This is so awesome to used because I get to listen to anything I want it is the best but there is one problem can you please put it as much skipping as we want. Please,0
"I love listening to music on this app; it's definitely better than YouTube Music. The main reason why its better is because it actually allows you to listen to music with your device screen turned (for free), unlike YouTube Music, which requires you to pay for that feature.",1
"Ok music app, but the music is not very loud, lacks punch, i have to have my phones volume up nearly full, needs some sort of volume booster built in like Vradio player, and the app now is full of ads, which makes it basically unusable.",0
Easy to use and great to listen to all my favorites!,1
It's not working every time I play song it doesn't play the correct song and it makes me mad because it does not work so I can't even play a song so its useless if I can't play a song. 1 star!,0
"I used to love learning about artists via Spotify using the about section. Why in god's name are you letting bands and artists write their own about section? They write in a form of language less comprehensive and more cringeworthy than most corporate branding reserved for enterprise technology companies. Rovi/TiVo does a good objective job. Stick with them, they have the collective audience in mind.",0
"I can listen to songs, and thats good. BUT. There is 2 problem. Whenever I try to play songs without premium, it plays a different song. Please dont do that my free time is ruined aaaaaaaa",0
"The app is great but for some reason, I can't cancel MY subscription, I've been scrolling to find Spotify Free button BUT there was no option but to change for more exchange, I'm trying not to get charged by the end of the subscription so please try and fix this problem.",0
You can get rid of those stupid Covid propaganda messages any day now. I might give you 3 stars you virtue signaling idiots. Stop if people wanted that they could watch TV. Joe Rogan is your biggest draw stop shooting yourself in the foot. You are better than that.,0
"i love this app, the automatic playlists based on your listening history ,music recommendations so so user intuitive",1
It as all the music I like and plenty other topics to choose from.,1
"The longer you go without premium, the more ads you get. I get about 4-5 ads every 2 songs, and the supposed ""30 minutes of free listening"" doesn't work anymore.",0
It's a good app. Although I logged out of my account so my friend could do something on her account cuz her phone died. But when I tried to log back in it said my account doesn't exist. I'm still logged into it on my Playstation and I'm putting in the exact info like username and everything on my phone but it still says it doesn't exist.,0
App is very good but the ads representation is very bad. Its okay that if I using the free version I have to watch but there is some limitations of ads representation they show 3 ads continuesly. This Thing I don't like.,0
The plus sign is excellent  Brilliant idea for organizing the songs correctly into playlists Dont listen to negative feedbacks about changing it to the heart They dont know what theyre talking about  Keep going,1
It is very interesting and easy app for music and podcasting.,1
"I've had the app for a while now, and I've never had any issues until recently. For some reason the music will randomly stop which is really annoying. If it weren't for this I would've give the app 5 stars. Please get this fixed asap so I can continue to enjoy my Playlists",0
"Very relaxing, entertaining, and enlightening.",1
Good app doesn't take much of your mobile space and you can find almost every song you search for,0
YouTube better,1
Paidd for premium with mpesa function twice and didn't get premium features why?,0
Great music streaming service.I will love the user interface of the app and have other using this on other platforms such as Alexa and chrome cast,1
it's so cool I can listen to kpop songs very easily,1
Very nice app for personalized music. All things are sorted. I love SpotifyðŸ¥°â¤ï¸,1
"If I wanna listen to a song let me listen that a song don't make me listen to a bunch of other songs, and if I add a song to my playlist don't make me listen to other songs not in my playlist this app is terrible.",0
"Enjoying the daily mixes, sending so much unheard music my way",1
It keeps asking for Bluetooth permissions and the timebar won't appear at times.,0
"I really like Spotify, and generally I've not had issues with it. But the last few months, I have to keep clearing my cache and then restarting my phone, because every time it connects to Bluetooth and plays a few songs, the volume at high quality will degrade horribly. Sounds like the speakers are just giving out, but using any other input is fine, including YouTube over Bluetooth. Very frustrating.",0
"Is it just me or there's always something wrong with the app? Sometimes it forces me to listen to the same album all day, even if I select different artist, it plays one song and then jumps back. Shuffle turns on for no reason. Shuffling is a nightmare by itself - when listening to a large selection on repeat for a few days, it gets smaller until theres like 10 songs left that are repeating over and over. Don't even get me started on connected devices. Extensive settings is a plus though.",0
Absolutely very oXm Music ðŸŽµ player and sound quality,1
Best music site ever. Great selection and can listen to entire albums. Thank you!,1
Only problem I've ever had is that you can't pull up your downloaded songs on your liked playlist,0
"It will add random songs to your playlists and you can't remove them, Comparing mobile Spotify to web browser Spotify is like comparing a troglodyte to Einstein",0
I like this app it's very easy to use I am enjoying this experience,1
extra ordinary good,1
Great,1
Love this app,1
The audio and lyrics are amazing but I just don't understand why I can't listen to a specific song and when I make a Playlist with less than 15 songs it's automatically adds songs by itself and I can't even skip properly Also my ad experience is below zero,0
Most recent update has made the app unusable. It will randomly stop playing. Won't let you pause. Doesn't display the playback bar and can only stop playback when you close the app down.,0
I love spotify but I hate that the part that shows the song playing and how long it has left disappears. I like to skip to a part of the song but can. I hate the songs in my Playlist shuffle instead of playing in order & some of the songs don't even play. Please fix,0
Almost unusable on samsung phone,0
This app keeps saying im offline and can't connect to the Internrt while on Spotify making me restart my hole phone to listen to music I don't have downloaded. This ussed to happen every week or so but not happens multiple times a day this sucks because enow I can even use the app for music please fix This,0
eiridi tavri,1
No more buying online n lost it when changed phone or PC crush. No hardcopy that take up space. Plenty of choices. Yay.,0
"First time user, so far easy enough to navigate.",1
Fantastic app. So easy to use with great content,1
Love Spotify! I don't think any other music/podcast streaming platform is as good as Spotify. Highly recommend 10/10.,1
"Please bring back the ""Shuffle"" button! I'm fed up of my playlists starting at the beginning and playing the same songs over and over. I don't give a stuff about Adele's demands. Not everyone is a fan of her depressing music!",0
"pretty fantastic, just wish they'd make song radios based off the cadence of the song it's radioing rather than what other people that also like it also listen to D:",0
Love being able to pick the songs I love..,1
Its better to pirate musics than using this... no youtube is better.,0
It's a very good app and I have premium duo but I wish it stopped pausing out of nowhere during a group session and it only happens when I text someone! ðŸ˜¡,0
Latest update breaks the app and wont show the bar at the bottom with currently playing song.,1
"It's good, the only bad thing is that when ads come up they take too long, longer than I get to listen to my musoc.",0
"Good music selection but if you don't upgrade, than 1 song = 2-3 (30 second commercials) Checkout Sound Cloud.. Sound Cloud has commercials too, but you get more individual tracks before 1 (20 second advertisement) Sound Cloud allows you to stream 2hr+ dj or live performance sets w/out interruption, Spotify interrupts after each song with 2-3, (30 second commercials) it's completely wrong.",0
"I had given it one star but increased to 4 cause the songs no longer pause randomly, and the curated playlists and song recommendations are amazing. I'd give it 5 stars if the sound improved.",1
Great music on hand. Best app on the internet.,1
I'm happy with the app and its current state. For the future I would appreciate the ability to customise the timer in the following ways: 1. Play until END OF QUEUE. This is mainly so we can play an entire album or playlist without having to manually stop it if we have the Autoplay feature on. 2. The ability to set a user specified time as the 1 hour maximum may be too low. Granular control of downloads by allowing us to download individual songs from an album,0
there is a new feature where it doesn't let u add songs to playlists or to queue without playing the song which is very inconvenient,0
"Please, how do I turn the shuffle off? Is annoying. I don't need the shuffle thing",0
Bring them lyrics back,1
Service is a complete joke. Recommends music from genres you don't listen to even though they say it won't provide results like that. Support is dismissive and just overall unhelpful. I wouldn't pay for premium so you can give them analytics about you and then they still mess it up.,0
why ðŸ‘ are ðŸ‘ there ðŸ‘ so ðŸ‘ many ðŸ‘ adsðŸ‘ ðŸ‘,0
10022024 This app used to be amazing up until about 6 months ago First they messed with the algorithms so now my shuffle liked songs just pushes my most recently liked songs and recently released songs to the front I see what youre doing  I have 15k liked songs and want to hear ALL of them not just the most recent ones Even more recently Im having serious performance issues If it aint broke dont fix it It wasnt broke take this app back to what it was September 2023,1
I really don't know what's going on with this app. As of lately nothing works like it's suppose to. There are tons of issues that many of the people below me have touched on. Spotify get it together.,0
I can't search any song when I click on it closes the app and I can't change songs language that which language's song I want please fix this problem,0
"I love spotify, I'm just having difficulty finding where to make my music stop changing the volume on its own.",0
"Great service , gets better each month",1
I cant play music unless I shuffle the music and can't even listen to my Playlist,0
"The app hasnt been working for a long time, the play button disappears all the time even after the upgrade or whatever spotify need to fix there problems fast or else im finding a new music app",0
I use this app when I'm bored ... And I started singing with the songs in audio .. some songs doesn't have lyrics..and even then I just love music.. and who is not found of listening to awesome music .... And my favourite is telugu music.. and all my time I keep listening ðŸŽ§ music .... All the time I keep listening ðŸŽ§â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸ music..,1
I gave it 4 stars because 1. Ot doesn't pay for the usage of artists songs but I also gave it 4 stars becuade it has Mr. Ballen podcast on it and he's the king of true crime stories,1
Amazing app nd whatever song u searchðŸ”... U r gonna find it.... It's so flexible to use nd really good audioðŸ”Š quality ðŸ¥°,1
Much better devs the ads are more tailored and have less of them and now you can somewhat pick ur songs,0
I don't like apps that don't take responsibility for content and try distractions instead substantive steps to clean up their act.,0
I'm through with Spotify for giving in to cancel culture mob. Which is unfortunate because the app works great and has pretty much everything.,0
I LOVE this app I literally use it every day,1
"Love the price and accessibility, but has been glitching far too much for my liking these past few months. As an android user I don't have many other options, but they need to get the freezing and connectivity issues sorted out.",0
WHEN I GO TO MY MUSIC IT KEEPS PUTING MUSIC THAT I DONT KNOW AND MUSIC THAT ARE NOT IN MY PLAYLIST LIKE FIX IT,0
Love to hear your music ðŸŽ¶ on Spotify,1
Sounds great it's great works great love to set up layout nice and easy simple no problem finding the bands on one of the fun like pangea,1
It is a really good streaming service to listen to any song that you can for free. But the function to filter the liked playlist isn't working. I don't know why as this is a useful feature. I'm not sure if this is the same for everyone else though. But other than that it is possibly the best music streaming service there is.,1
I mean you know exactly what Spotify has to offer but I would add that the single best customer service experience I had was with Spotify and that was when I was an unpaid subscriber I dont begrudge them at all my 3month,1
"Dude I've been on Spotify for God knows how many years, y'all have done me a lot of good, but the 5 ads between every single song is ridiculous. I'm seriously considering deleting it. Not to mention you also do not pay the artists for the money you make off their songs, which is against copyright laws. Honestly I may just delete",0
Hate the ads,0
Brilliant,1
I like it but I want to pick my own song instead of it to be shuffle all of my liked songs like I want listen to my songs in a row and then when I try to skip I only have six skip and if I want to get the things that I want I have to pay for premium and I dont have money just pay couple of dollars a month,0
"Best app ever! Works smoothly, easy to use and it has a friendly interface.",1
"Fix your garbage app! Paying customer for over 5 years and I have had app crashing bugs for 90 percent of my use time in the last two years. I am fed up and will be canceling my subscription if this is not addressed shortly. If you have android, stay far, far away from this absolutely dumpster fire. You've been warned.",0
"I really love listening to spotify but they made some serious changes, there will be only 6 skips per hour like what is this??? This is so unfair when i wanna skip the music while playing AND I HAVE TO FINISH THE MUSIC OR OPEN THE SPOTIFY APP, please made a very good update.",0
I like this app but I have a problem with the lyrics will not show up thats just my problem but overall I like it,1
I love the features this app has and the fact that you can listen to the latest songs and podcasts in a nick of time it so satisfying. â¤,1
The new update is just horrible. I can't play songs I want to listen and instead have to wait for it to play next. Please fix this.,0
I don't know what happened but I can't see the songs that I added in my play lists but in my liked songs I can see them. I'm hoping it could be fixed or it's just my problem? But this app is awesome 5 stars:)),1
I gave it a 5 star bcuz I love how it has artist that not a lot of other apps have. But lately Spotify has been stopping during a podcast or it won't want to work properly. So i have to either exit out completely of the podcast or restart my phone.. it also has been skipping on some songs like if it was on a CD. But over all it's a freaking amazing music app .. i love it. I dropped all my other apps and just stick to this one â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,0
"I absolutely love this app ... But all of a sudden since 2 days the glitch made it impossible for me to play a song.. it keeps crashing and also got logging in problem all though it's upto date ... Unfortunately, I had to uninstall it ðŸ¥²",0
"There is ads and it,s really annoying but there is good music",1
We nice,1
"App has become completely unusable on my Galaxy S21. The media controls no longer show up at all, even after a restart and reinstalling the app.",0
Amazeballs,1
"Overall, I'm satisfied with the app, but I give them 3 stars because my music that I like frequently deletes and they didn't tell Neil Young and the other woke idiots to STFU.",1
Oh yeah I wi rate it it's glitching out and PS4 and Xbox Spotify dosent work it's just bad at this point,0
"This app is amizaing cuz you can listen to music anytime you want, and after the update it got starting to be restrocting cuz of the shuffle plays and i can't listen to music properly, please remove the shuffle play",0
I love that they won't cave into the woke climate! Best music app! Much better than I heart.,1
Its very good app â˜ºï¸ but it would more better is we could listen to songs offline tooðŸ¥º,0
"I left a review earlier, but as Spotify seems to have gotten worse, it's only right to also worsen my review. What's the point of Spotify making an album available, AND THEN PLAYING SONGS OUT OF THE ALBUM?! WHY? I DIDN'T EVEN MAKE THE PLAYLIST. I'm uninstalling this app, once I pay for YouTube music. At least they don't play things that I don't ask for in the name of me not paying for premium.",0
Excellent especially the playlist they give takes me back,1
It's very good Amazing experience and very organising.,1
"Opens to a black screen on Android 12, then crashes. Reinstall didn't fix the issue.",0
I love Spotify...so many options. Can spend hrs on there. Definitely recommend to everyone,1
Good app but i cant play the songs i want to it plays random songs i never even knew about in my playlist when i choose any song it plays random songs like that.,0
Very good app better than Pandora,1
Easy to access and list of song uptodate,0
"This is actually a very good app to litsen to music, i dont mind getting ads once a while but i hate the update where we cant even litsen to a certain song we want, it shuffles with random different other songs, like. I just wanna litsen to this one song but i can't. Pls fix this update, this update is useless and horrible ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¼",0
Closes randomly like every 10 minutes. Not even worth student pricing because it's so useless.,0
This is the best app for listening any songs.... i have no words to describe .... i just love it ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œâ¤â¤ðŸ’‹,1
Too many ads. It's annoying.,0
Can't replay any song more than 3 times it just stops playing all together after restarting I can only playback a song once before same happens without premium this app is garbage,0
All you need. Works on all platforms. Never had any issues. Pretty complete service for very decent money. Only thing missing potentially are access to audiobooks.,0
It was great .. but the new version isn't showing what song is playing at the bottom. So I can't change it or anything. Tried logging out and on again.. idk,0
"Most used app on my phone but would be better if when you sort your playlist by artist, title ect. Other people would see it in that order and not from oldest at the top to newest at the bottom. Would be so helpful. Just an Idea but if you could create an algorithm that connects peoples spotify's and makes a playlist based on songs all of the people like. Would be great for party's and meets. Make this and you're unstoppable. And spwipe left on a song goes to ""add to playlist""ðŸ”¥+an ampme functio",0
"Selling out to stupid, radical right-wing nutjobs? C'mon Spotify. You used to be about the music, the art, creating a space for beauty and meaning in the world. Now you're just about lining the pockets of your executives and promoting garbage to the lowest common denominator. Shame on you Spotify, shame.",0
"Easy to use, no ads. Amazing 5 out of 5",0
"This is the most retard application I ever saw in my life, Whenever I search a song and play it, out of nowhere an unknown song starts playing by itself",0
Love this app! But it keeps on shutting down everytime I start playing music. Is it only me? Or anybody else experiencing the same?,0
Not for worst songs but for best music 3-star review,1
The integration with Sonos is still non-sufficient. Volume normalization and several other features are not working (which remains unchanged for five years already). Working on interfaces should be in the interest of both parties involved. Else than that I like it.,0
Awesome music every time I want it,1
Good app but can't play previews,1
"Perfect, sometimes glitches",0
Premium spotify continually crashes... only just started since last update,0
"Stopped working in my car due to Spotify wanting you to purchase there new Car Thing, doesn't show play lists on the U.I or songs. I'm cancelling three contracts that are coming up for renewal and moving over to itunes. I can get 6 users for Â£15 and my Kenwood Double Din supports this. Spotify you are spineless cheats because for six months now Spotify hasn't worked in my car and you knew the reason why but didn't feel the need to share this with you're customers I.e Pioneer/JVC/Kenwood users.",0
Best music player,1
Just decided to start loading super slow lately. Deleted cache and reinstalled and no better,0
"Words can never do justice to the perfection of this app or service. If there are any bugs, the utility this app provides would make those bugs literally disappear. I love Spotify!",0
Getting any kind of support on the app is not happening.,0
Spotify provides me with the bestðŸ‘Œ# One in my book. ThanksðŸ˜Š,1
I enjoy all the choices and quality of the music!,1
"Spotify is amazing! I love it! It's the best option to stay updated about news, listen excellent podcasts and great music!",1
This app is so nice and very wonderful,1
Horrible app worst listening app ever whenever I try playing a song it just plays a completely other song I'm done with this app,0
"Due to the new bugs I have canceled my premium membership and switched to Pandora and SXM. No need to leave a comment on why, just read all the other comments. I'll be back once you fix the issue.",0
Low quality sounds and very buggy app,0
It would be much better with English lyrics for all languages. And would like to have a good option for changing order of songs in a playlist.,0
Great music old and new I can always find what I am looking for,1
The enhanced feature in personal playlists causes songs that are after the last recommended song to not play. You have to turn off enhance in order to play those songs.,1
Fave a fun,1
Spotify has made my entire record collection all but redundant.,0
Only thing I don't like is when I want use it in car use Mobil data doesn't workâ˜¹ï¸,0
very like,1
"What is wrong with spotify lately?? Everytime I leave the tab and come back, the music tab doesn't show when I click a song and the song won't even stop. I have to close the app all the damn time otherwise it's just lagging. It's so annoying ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’",0
Great music application ðŸ‘Œ,1
Since last update its been unusable on my S22+. Yet I pay for premium every month....,0
Way too many ads!! Like stop at least let us listen two songs peacefully!! Y'all literally drop the ads after every song.,0
Love this app for 6 years butbits starting to become bug-gy. My Spotify continuously crashes meaning I have to set up music multiple times while working which is annoying but I've had the app for years and don't really want to switch. I also find podcasts are great but the app is not designed for podcast listening and hoards your previous plays meaning you need to manually undownload or get rid of podcasts you've listened to which sicks for podcasts but is awesome for music. Many pros to Spotify,0
There are ads after each song. It's like this app plays ads more than anything else. Hate it.,0
"Galaxy S20; The window with the song controls such as skip, pause, shuffle playlist, etc does not show up. The only control I have is to start playing an episode/song. To pause, I have to completely close the app. Very inconvenient and I pay for the premium version.",0
This app is going down hill fast! Everytime it gets updated they screw it up more and more. I'm now on my second uninstall/reinstall and library download and it's ridiculous! Get it together Spotify...,0
I love Spotify! But the new update made me give it a 1 star because I can't view the lyrics when I tried clicking the lyrics section. Fix this asap!,0
App changed due to the latest update is not possible to listen a preview of a song before add to your list.,0
"Love the ease of making playlists, and the songs they suggest are usually spot on.",1
Excellent arrangement and easy to create a playing list,1
Somewhat interesting,1
I can listen to my favourite songs like stand proud or nightmare and I would recommend this app to any age because it's just music This 5 star review was made by Aaron Lee Newman ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ,1
"""Your username is designed to identify you, so you can't change it"". It no longer identifies me, though...?! Why would you do this and ruin the experience for many people? I might have to make a new account and delete mine in the future in order to be safe. No reason to pay either if experiences are ruined at random by no username changes. Friend activity also is broken and unable to be turned on.",0
"Where did the personally downloaded features go? I've noticed it for a while, but thought they might be shifting something around. I cannot access just my downloaded library by artist or album anymore, any link to the particular artist just takes me to the artists home page, which is all their music, not just the stuff I have saved. It used to be an option and I'd love for you to add it back. Should be the bottom right button "" your library"" which you'd think would be there already...",0
Nice,1
The reason i give iy a 4 is because whenever i try to play a song it will go to abother song and it gets annoying becasue when i search up a song it give me the name of the song but it goes to another song because like every song is on shuffle. Is it just me or no?,0
It just open and crashes,0
"I hate when i search for a song, it doesn't play immediately",0
"Playlist shuffle is sucks, I'm fed up with it. I only hear same songs over and over again. Need an option to fix this shuffle soon. Other than that this is a good app. Until fix shuffle I give 01 STAR. FIX IT!",0
Better than youtube music they let you play music you like with out having to pay for being able to play music and drive at the same time,1
"Let us block podcasts. If i get one more notification about ""call her daddy"" or ""joe rogan"" releasing new episodes, I'm going to loose it. I don't even get notifications for the podcasts i actually listen too ðŸ™„",0
I really like this app. But it's been acting up lately,0
Please give me a place for party playlist But your love song playlists are very good ðŸ˜Ž,1
Love the music variety and app. Although buyer beware the download while on cellular data toggle is very buggy and while I had it set to off the app downloaded 7 GB worth of music to my phone before I got a notification from my carrier of high data usage. Never really been an issue until the last couple of updates but could cost someone alot of money luckily I have 8 GB worth of data or that could have cost me $700 (my carrier charges $10 per 100mb after limit). This needs to be fixed!,0
"App works but it's a bit slow, doesn't always load when I try and fast forward a song, it also takes quite a long time compared to the app for iPhone. S21fe.",0
This app is awsome you can pretty much listen t what you want,0
"What is wrong with the app, it keeps pausing songs, can't even listen to one song without it being paused 5 times. Please fix this or I'll be looking to listen someplace else!",0
Good app for songs,1
"Recently spotify hasn't been letting me listen to songs and says that all playlists that I click on are empty (even random ones) whenever I click on my library it's empty even tho I know I havent deleted any of my playlists, whenever I go to my own profile they are all there though and it's getting really annoying since this is a streaming app that I love",0
Impressive library of music best I've found on any app.,1
Ihave enjoyed this app but i think u need to make an option to download a song,0
Missing hi-res music. Shuffle is not very random and repeats too many songs.,0
good,1
"Through android auto, Spotify is loud for the first couple of seconds. Then the volume dips, and the music is only as loud as you speak, despite being cracked to the max. All other apps through AA or the radio/Sirius in the car don't do this. Why does Spotify keep shting the bed? Problem solved: bought a tesla with built in Spotify.",0
The latest update has totally screwed it up on Samsung. So glitchey and unreliable now,0
One of the best music and podcast apps out there. Love it!,1
I like this app been using this for 1 year but my problem is when one song that is incomplete from downloading my playlist wont open in offline,0
Love Spotify! Just having problems now when I changed to a new phone. I can't find the controls toggle. No lyrics too. ðŸ˜Ÿ hope to fix this soon.,0
That the best app to listening music,1
Great music lovers appreciate it.,1
I have had Spotify for 7 plus years nothing else can beat it,0
Amazing,1
Got good music on there but when I don't want to listen to that song it wouldn't let me skip it when I had not touched that button for well other 2 hours,1
Lot of advertising,0
"The sound quality is surreal. But the ads....they tell you that you'll have 30 minutes of free listening,but you don't get it even after hearing 2 ads. So disappointed.",0
"I mean lots of choice but the ap has become really buggy recently and its so annoying. Wont play music somtimes despite being on a fast network and when in offline mode it wont even load pre-downloaded songs. Its new bug is playing content but when in the app to say skip or even know what song is playing it is not actually showing its playing anything, so you can hear it on headphones but cant control it in the app and thus its no longer very convenient. Not convenient and awful.",0
An amazing app for music lovers ðŸ˜,1
The problem of the people giving reviews here is that they dont wanna pay a penny about the service and just want to complain about it Spotify is not a charitable trust its a private corporate company and if the people arent paying for it and installing mod apks then they have to do something about this I have bought apple music and Spotify for 3 months now and all in the end I see the recommendation algorithm of a music service wins everytime for a longtime purpose and here Spotify wins,1
Cuts out while playing. Can't control with headphones. Playing song can't be found. Need to close then reopen,0
Amazing i would say I'm not premium member but I didn't give it full 5 star because sometimes the ads are quite often to the point that there would ads after every song and other is that sometimes it just stops working it doesn't show me which song I'm playing so they fixed that i would rate it 5 star without being a premium member,0
"Why do you need to have our credit card information just to have a free trial month of Spotify premium. If you say it's free and to try it now, wait until they pay for premium to add the credit card. It just sucks when you think you'll get a free trial but it asks for your credit card when you don't even have one to begin with.",0
I cant fast forward or skip anything. Song wont show its playing. Cuts out extremely frequently to the point im probably going to switch to pandora soon. This is ridiculous. Im paying for this? What happened all of a sudden? I cant even listen to white noise anymore to help me sleep...it just wont allow me to set a sleep timer. This whole experience is officially ruined for me ðŸ˜ž. Here i come pandora,0
Horrible... I can't find the buttons... The songs won't show up... Even if I updated it... What happened??!!,0
Best music source that there is out there and lots and different music to listen to alos the 3 month free trial is very good much love to Spotify,1
Excellent Music Spotif App meet Music lover discovery and Evergreen.,1
"Y'know spotify is such a convenience I never thought to rate it, spotify without premium is okay you can listen to your music only online, you have limited skips, and you can only do shuffle play, but where it really gets good, you can listen to music offline, listen in to music with friends if you see them listening to music on discord, you can create playlists with your friends, you even get a ton of extra settings to adjust your music how you'd like it, spotify even makes playlists for you!",1
"Has some good songs, plus some bad ones. Is an OK app, but very limited on free mode. Sometimes adds freeze, locking out the songs until app is reset. Plays songs that are not what I like at all, taste profile seems broken in places. Too many podcasts to scroll through while using Android Auto before music selection can be made.",0
This is the best app to listen to music and release you stress â¤ðŸ§¡ðŸ’›ðŸ’š I would use this app 24/7ðŸ’¯,1
"One of my major problems with Spotify is the fact that when the recommended songs play, you can't stop them and just listen to your pkaylist songs. I don't want to listen to random songs Spotify ""thinks"" I like. Its never accurate and bluntly annoying. Get rid of this please. Thank you.",0
Great app but I don't want shuffle to repeat songs in a playlist till the whole playlist has been played.,0
"Constantly glitching, have to delete the app with all my downloads to fix constant glitchess. 10 out a 10 would not pay for premium. Free apps in 2001 worked better. The JRE is the only reason I keep this terrible app. Also Amazon's music is slightly worse so you have that.",0
"Not non podcasts user friendly, too many front page podcast suggestions without an option to turn off. Update its gotten worse",0
"Your app needs a MAJOR redesign.The Joe Rogan podcast deal didn't make podcasts better on your app. Try a redesign of the UI that makes sense. That makes it easier to discover new things.Make it a more social and Connected network. Some new button deisgns, colour schemes, symmetry, minimalist.DARK AND LIGHT MODE. I can go on forever.Pump that cash into a user friendly design and make it available both for iOS and Android at the same time.Give users control.windows Xp media player visualisation.",0
Blend wins all the stars. I'd give one extra if I could.,1
Wow love it,1
"One star until we are allowed to play one song at the time AGAIN LIKE HOW IT USED TO BE. I search for a particular song, then boom you told me to play the whole playlist? Also stop adding new songs into playlist that we created, its annoying!",0
"It's the best music app in my opinion but it has its annoyances anyway, like mixing up Podcasts and Music across the app, there should be a way of separating them, I use both but it's confusing and frankly annoying that I have to see Podcasts everywhere when I just want to listen music and viceversa.",0
what is going on new update has destroyed this app if this continues I will be ending my subscription literally just plays random songs and unpairs for no reason.. fix the app people pay for this,0
"I can't play the song i want to, i can only shuffle play",0
Music is fantastic and choices are righteous your style your choice,1
Great music experience with Spotify ðŸ™‚âœ¨â˜„ï¸,1
It keeps adding songs I don't want in my playlist even my spotify on my tv doesn't do that I want to listen to one song not so many.,0
I like listening to the music and podcasts,1
"What the hell?? You cant control the timestamp of the song, and if you want to play another song in your liked songs you cant play it, it only give you a short moment of the song and IT IS SO ANNOYING, YOU CANT EVEN PLAY AGAIN THE SONG WHEN YOU WANT, YOU CANT DRAG IT TO THE LEFT SIDE OH MY GODD",0
Love this app any song group you are looking for ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚,1
Nice app.. but the ads are too much,0
I couldn't live without Spotify!!,1
Great app some songs skip sound but most the time works great ,1
It doesn't play the next song in the list and instead plays something random I tried fixing my settings to the best of my ability but failed to fix the problem. There also isn't a reset settings options and it if there is it's hard to find. I don't find the app user friendly for those less experienced with these type of things I'll have to look up a guide or tutorial or SMTH on the internet when I have more time.,0
It was okay but then they updated it and all of a sudden I can only listent to my Playlist on shuffle mode. I also can't just listen to any song individually. They say it's free but you really have to buy premium to get anything good to come out of it.,0
"Normally don't write reviews. However, my liked songs Playlist will literally play the same bout maybe just 30 songs out of the hundreds I literally have in a constant mini shuffle and will start over. I checked settings to see if there was a solution. I removed the app re downloaded. Deleted cache and app memory. Problem still ongoing. Real close to canceling and getting a new app for music",0
wrost app services. when 1st time after installation the app ads was come after 5 songs/1 ad. Then after-3 Songs/1 ad. Then 3 songs/2 ads then 2 songs/ 2 ads and after using 6 months after play only one song and the back to back 3 ads. premium charges are too high. Gaana is far better then this app. i'm uninstalling here right now and installing gaana app. please don't use this app.,0
This app is terrible and getting worse. Very buggy and non-responsive. About 5 minutes from getting rid of Spotify for good.,0
When I try to play a song it dosnt work and when I press the play button it plays another song,0
Plays even though I stopped the app and can't figure out how to cancel ðŸ˜’,0
"Love the variety of music you have. I plan on going premium,honestly commercial breaks aren't bad if you don't want premium.",1
Great music to hear on Mobile Good,1
The app has a lot of bugs. I'm constantly having to force stop the app due to it freezing up several times a day. FIX THE GIITCHES ALREADY! This app is turning to trash. I would rate this app a 0 if I could. This is my last month passing for this bs,0
I'm very happy with Spotify. Doesn't take a lot of data storage.,1
Why am I not giving 2 more stars? On phone you cannot play the songs of your choice from even your own playlist but you can do that on computer. You can skip songs on phone only 6 times. You can't even loop your songs. And there is an ad time to time. How to get rid of all of that? Oh just buy premium! Is it not too much that you have to buy something to even just pick the song of your choice or skip all the time? Premium for listen along sounds fair but for others not really.,0
It crashes when I play the song I don't think I'll download it again good bye,0
"Can't listen to what you want, just plays any old song in a library, and loads of 30 second adverts, can't listen to what we want and can't even view playlists properly and there's no way I'd pay Â£9.99 a month for this, I might be tempted to give it a try at Â£5 a month but don't think it's worth anywhere near Â£9.99 and for that price the developers don't even reply to any of the comments on here that I've seen so far. I'm new to Spotify and can't believe how messed up this app is.",0
V good app there was every song in Spotify but sometimes there are very ads even after every song,0
"SPOTIFY is changing, and not for the better.... They have finally gone ""woke"" Bands complete discography is no longer on the site.... It's a bunch of live stuff and artist radio! I used to love Spotify! Since you canceled artists I may have to cancel you, for good.... What a shame!",0
Love all the music and when I'm offline I still can listen to what I saved on the app,1
"I can't access my playlists, there's no repeat option, it plays music's I never select... It's impossible to enjoy this app! I want to listen my favourite music and not music select by someone else!",0
Terrible update. Ever since the update it is glitchy. It will turn itself down while I'm listening to I'm listening to it and if I lock my phone it wont-work even though it used to work when my phone was locked.,0
"Lots of good music, and suggestions for finding music I enjoy.",1
"Spotify is an excelent product, many sincere and heartfelt thanks and thumbs up for Spotify. Welldone.",1
"Im deleting. I try playing my playlist and it starts playing songs that arent even on there, adding randoms songs to my ""liked"" playlist. Try clicking on a song and it only plays a few seconds of it.",0
App is horrible. Won't stop asking me about Bluetooth. To select a JRE episode I have to scroll forever then tap it you can't hit play from the search engine you'll tap it and it does nothing. Been an issue for around a year or more lol,0
Too much ads,0
I CANT GET INTO MY STUPID PLAYLIST AND WHEN I DO RANDOM SONGS PLAY.,0
Biggest issue is I cannot reorder playlists manually or make folders in app. Other than that the app is fine. Something I'd love to have in app is though is the ability to set alarms and have them point to a specific song or playlist. There are alarm apps that sync to Spotify but none match the want/need that I have.,1
"I'm not using this app since a long time ... because the thing which makes me not to open this app is ""NO DOWNLOAD OPTION !!!"" I request uh to fix my problem...",0
"It is so fun and I really recommend Spotify, however you do have to pay to get premium wich u can listen to music without ads and without Wi-Fi, but overall GREAT awesome",1
I love spotify and for beginners i know that you are gonna get used to this cause it even shows you the genre you listen to like indie pop or hip hop or rock n roll or rap depends on what music you listen to so i advise you all to download spotify,1
Freezing all the time. Have to force shut.,0
It's too good to listen music without un interepring,1
Love this app.. but why is it everytime I'm in my feels listening to sad music a ad comes on atp I don't even wanna cry anymore u ruined it. U guys are like listening to me cry it seems like it ðŸ˜».,0
All previous comments been covered. Started off brilliant under premium plan. Now ads coming fast as. I didn't pay to listen to ads & lose playlists etc. I'm canceling subscription.,0
"I really loved this app, I've been using it for years now, and it started to be bad. If I make a new playlist, and go to add songs, I cannot listen to any of the songs. PLEASE FIX THIS IM BEGGING ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",0
"Spotify, stop with the unnecessary ads please. If you wana earn,stop it youll earn double I guarantee you guys bye",0
The best in music and audio,1
I love it till I had problem with it not showing options to pause please I need a update,1
I love Spotify obviously but why did it revert an update. Now I can't do basic things like swipe right to add to queue,0
The shock part of Spotify is just a word in a song will be easily found and I had no problems example happy then find a song word happy and a list will appear your song been found 5 stars also can.,1
"Close to perfect PLEASE add a gesture to swipe down a song once you open up the player, it's extremely annoying to have to use the back button or swipe right to dismiss the player. Also it opens somewhat slowly in Android compared to ios, at least on my galaxy s22.",0
In my case I can't play my own little play list how I want and whenever I click a song it just plays a sample of a song I want to hear instead of playing the song I chose to listen to even though originally it never did this till now,0
Spotify premium is great app to play all your fav music!,1
"I really enjoy listening to SPOTIFY, especially when there is an artist's music I want to listen to.",1
I love all the musical options for free..and how it makes play list I can acess from phone or google dot..realy works for us!,1
Spotify always delivers the best recommended songs you like.This is the best app I have used where I changed more than 5 apps. Using Spotify makes me feel special. The bass boosted is the best option and works perfect.,1
It's the greatest thing since jelly with peanut butter.,1
"it's an amazing app, get all the music you want ðŸ˜",1
"Great, if you can't find a song on YouTube then go on Spotify it's also great bacause you can put that in repeat u can't do that on YouTube ðŸ‘ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",0
It's very good in few months but now day it's very irritating for me I cannot explain how terrible apps I really don't like this aap too much ads and very much horrible aap comparisons from other music AAP like gaana is better for this music apps I am music lovers and I don't recommend this Spotify aap for music lovers don't download this app I am very sad to download this app if you are music lovers don't download this app it's too much ads and too mach irritating ads ads ads ads ads and adssss,0
"Absolute terrible update. When shuffle play is on i cannot go back to listening the song i played. And i can't even turn off shuffle play because it requires premium. Such a bad app i used past over the months. And when i go to a playlist, i cannot even play the songs. Worst update.",0
"Doesn't work with Pioneer Head unit anymore. Since the update in Februrary, I'm unable to connect to my Pioneer head unit in van. Update: app updated 6/6 and still doesn't work.",0
Good,1
Spotify... Your service is amazing but your app has annoying issues with downloaded content. Why does downloaded content wait for a network connection before it displays?,0
Music player keeps randomly disappearing until u reset the app,0
"Easy, no adds, price stays the same",0
Extremely disappointed that I was unable to view my Spotify Wrapped 2021 after trying everything possible to fix the problem. It's something that I look forward to every year.,0
This app let's me hear all my music I like even if my phone is off I can still hear,1
Best app for music discovering. The ads are a bit unpleasant,0
"Never easier to have my favorite music in one place and quickly accessible. Let alone new hits, podcasts and...",0
One star rating after five minutes of use. At least You Tube Music doesnt throw up adverts every 5 seconds and allows me to create multiple play lists. And with You Tube suggestions like Rogan dont interrupt my songs.,1
It was good up until it started playing random songs that weren't even on my playlist. I couldn't get it to exclusively play the playlist I set up. It kept adding random ones in that I hated.,1
Spotify software is almost as annoying as Apple software. The constant badgering to link to Bluetooth devices when opening the app can end at any time. It really sucks that when you search an artist it will not allow you to see all their top songs. Most of the time you don't know what album it's from and you just want to see the top 15 or 20 songs. You can't on Spotify. It also continuously auto plays everytime you get in your vehicle rather than staying paused. Blasts when you get in.,0
"Used to love it, but now that they changed it so that my music and podcasts are in the same place I hate it. And because they changed it know it's almost impossible to find my downloads. Pretty much unusable.",0
Glad they fixed the preview song to add to playlist.,0
"I hope you add data saver where the lyrics and background videos dont play, For data users sake. And also i hope you give random related songs suggestions when we play so we can explore more like in Yt music app",0
What has happened to this app i cant repeat the song or skip the song . Random songs are added to my playlist i cant do anything i cant even keep it on shuffle because random songs come in there from nowhere i really liked the app but i cant use it now please do fix this and the repeat button is not there i love listening my fav song on repeat but i cant do it now spotify please fix it asap,0
Love it all the time no commercials,1
"After every song I would get about 3-4 ads. Features are very limited, limited skips, shuffle only overall a really bad app. I would reccomend only using the desktop version but ads are really incessant there too.",0
"Love the app and the music variety but can you please bring back the big ""Shuffle Music"" icon. Having such a small icon attached to the play icon is painful to use. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE change the stupid icon for play and shuffle",0
I signed up for 30 day trial and can't play my play list,0
"Awesome, easy to use and I have choices, to listen to whom ever I want",1
Incredible. Smooth & simple usage plus valuable content...thanks for this amazing experience...:),1
Constant crash and video restarts. Instantly connects and plays last video to any Bluetooth device you are connected to,0
"Personally, I think it's the best app to listen to music to. But it includes too many advertisements and adds unwanted songs.For example, I removed a song off my playlist and it was automatically re-added.",0
Application isn't working with wifi,0
Good. But too many adsðŸ˜”,0
I truly appreciate and enjoy the freedom to choose my style of music in abundance without distraction so I can just focus on therapy and relaxation music it allows me find my happy place when the world becomes a challenging place to dwell in!,1
It has been an amazing journey so far. Didn't think it's exciting and extremely good to have as a music lover.,0
"Easy, Free, beautiful (music for many parts of the world)",1
Terrible app. Can't even play the song you want. When I click a song it plays something entirely different. You can't do anything about it unless you have premium or you use a computer,0
They never Miss a Beat !! I can get all genre of music along with My Favorite PODCASTS !!! Thank you SPOTIFY,1
Cool. Easy. Love Spotify.,1
It's really good I'm able to listen to music whenever I want but it sometimes don't open and say it's keep on stopping so I wish it changes rather than that everything is good,0
Love this app. You van make your on list and enjoy what you like to hear!!!!,1
Works great for a music program ma'am love to listen to the music they are good at making shuffles up for you sometimes you're like them sometimes you don't but they always make new ones up for you to try out to see if you like it and you can also delete an add songs you like by artist and other options through the app so it's not bad good app They also give you an option to pay or not to pay it depends on if you want to watch ads or listen to add aunt Ah mare but if you pay for premium you don',1
"I love Spotify subscription and have for 4+ years now, so I'm not quick to complain. However, I honestly can't finish a single song without the app pausing 10 seconds into every song or skipping 4 songs ahead of the one I had chosen to play. It's made the app unusable lately and makes me question my subscription.",0
"Love Spotify. I've used it for years. I love everything about it. Actually only one thing, for some reason it doesn't play ad loud on my devices or car as other apps do and my setting are all loud and high quality. Other than that I love it",1
"I love it, I personally feel it's bit difficult to find history of song I play. Maybe i lack sense to find it. But overall it's like the best app i ever used to play music.",1
Best music listening app ever,1
Something has changed. I can't skip songs and songs will stop for no reason. I pay 15 dollars a month please fix,0
It is so handy for finding songs and making playlists. I especially love Spotify Premium- no adds!,1
I love Spotify like what they do,1
"Gambling ads, interrupted by music. Australia has a gambling problem, but spotify have no issues feeding into this with 2/3 ads played and sometimes 3/3 ads played being for gambling. But hey, as long as you get ad revenue, who cares, right?",0
Best app for listening music,1
Downloaded this to listen to podcasts. There is a glitch problem where when im listening to an episode it will suddenly change to a different one. Very annoying.,0
It's slow! When opening the app my playlist & downloads are extremely slow loading. The main interface changes randomly at times on its own. Give more control to Premium Members across the board.,0
It has like all the songs. ðŸŽµ It is also super easy to find the song you won't to listen to. There is the perfect amount of ads as well. You can listen to songs anywhere you like.,1
Easy to find songs and artists.,1
"The best, deleted other streaming app when I found out about Spotify. So perfect",1
Great app. Use interface is good and there are a lot of podcasts and music available. I'm a fan.,1
Used to love this but can't even use it now. It doesn't play anything anymore. Says no internet when all other apps working fine on net. All playlists are apparently now empty. I am paying for a service i can't use. NOT HAPPY AT ALL. Fix this now or lose more customers.,0
"Without paying for this service it is garage. The ads are endless and they play the same ones over and over and the doorbell on the McDonald's ad makes my dog crazy. It's really not worth being able to hear a couple songs or part of a podcast and then you get this jarring, loud and annoying ad constantly interrupting your listening experience.",0
Has been good to me. No bugs or glitches sooo far.,0
"Great music recommendations once you out in your preferences, premium has extra functions like being able to save playlists",1
Beautiful,1
I am in love with Spotify. I'm yet to explore it's other features but the music experience is heavenly and I can't wait to have my own music on here sometime soon,1
"I recently decided to opt for premium, but when i entered the payment page there's no option for payment via Google Pay, only Paytm, which i don't use. Kindly add Google Pay as payment option in the next update.",0
Easy to use and has my favorite music,1
"why did the shuffle option change when you listen one of your playlists ? it just sucks, the same songs play on repeat and you juste have to skip them MULTIPLE TIMES when you could just skip them once before, and just go on with your 45h of songs. Also the linked songs in the radio are the same that are already in my playlists, yeah I like them but what I wanted was discover new ones... and if you want to remove them from radio because you already know them it just delete them from your playlist",0
Exceptional and unique I am satisfied with this app,1
"I've came on to check reviews. I've been having so many problems with this app for weeks now and seriously thinking of cancelling my subscription that I've had for 10 + years. I listen to alot of podcasts. Everytime I stop or pause it, when i go back in to play it again there's no controls. I've constantly to find where I left off, some times the only way to stop it is if i clear all the apps that are running. No drop down controls on lock screen. I would just like it to work like it did ðŸ˜¢",1
Yall need to fix the bugs.,0
Spotify is very good for streaming and for discovering nes music. The user interface is lacking. I would suggest zlidong down to go back in the now playing view.,0
Anything I wanted to hear. They got it.,1
Easy to use. Great selection,1
Totally cool nice interface,1
Just simple and clear how to use it. Even for 80++,1
"Spotify home screen is cluttered with useless features. One example is ""Jump back in"" - the music shown here has little to do with I like to listen, and music that I accidentally played tend to stick around a long time. Spotify UI team should re-learn 'less is more.'",0
A good way to find music and podcasts,1
"There is some problems with my Spotify. Whenever i open a song, it auto close. I tried so many things but it's still the same. Please fix this.",0
"It started to play by itself once connect headphones, sometimes without headphones, I am not always in the mood ,ðŸ¦·",0
This is top when I down I can get the right muise I love it,1
Very good super sound perfect song and sound not stop song...,1
Fix the issues already since the last update. I shouldn't have to pay for an app that doesn't work as it should.,0
I wish when you listened to you liked songs that it will play all of them random not just some over and over,0
I love this app the only problem with it is just when I have my own Playlist going it will turn on another song which isn't in it. Ads last a minute or two but they don't hurt at all. I would absolutely advise downloading this app for music and podcasts.,1
"It's good, until it won't load and you loose all downloads. I don't know what happened, I can't load my playlist, and it says I have no downloads.",0
It shuffles into other song instead of the song I'm looking for,0
Mostly good.I must admit that I don't always watch the ads!,1
"My favorite music app needs better ways of paying musicians, and increased financial transparency would go a long way",0
"Spotify is great, any music you enjoy can be found here. I enjoy it very much!",1
"Love Spotify , wonderful app. Wouldn't trade it.â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ’¯ðŸŒ¹",1
Spotify will automatically start playing in my car (newer corolla) if the bluetooth is on. No matter what. It is annoying to the extreme and will even play over phone calls. Looking into it this is a common problem with no solution. Please fix this!,0
Love it!I love being able to make my own playlists!,1
"The app is bug free, smooth as butter and perfect. Except for the fact that 5he number of ads is at 3 evry 3 songs! Would want Spotify to reduce that to like 1 every 20 songs?",0
"When I signed up it said I was offline while I LITTERALLY had 5G, fix this please",0
"Lived for Spotify until this last update. Doesn't work in my vehicles, doesn't show the current song playing and many other small problems. Annoyed I'm paying for a service that once was great but now is just annoying to use.",0
"Best and excellent app for Playing songs and coming to app its working so nice and no bug or anything,i left the lisning of songs 3 yrs ago when i download this app to listen a songs it truns me like a habbit to listen songs thanks you spotify team.",1
Wow always a wow moment just certain words on songs dont display and not alot of Gospel South African songs is found. But brilliant app,1
Downloaded music is never accessible when in airplane or 'offline mode'. What is the point,0
"Update: I swear it's like clockwork, every two weeks I have to reinstall because the app breakdown. Does anyone else have this problem? It's ridiculous and I'm getting really sick of it. (Old review) Current Version/Update: is basically unusable. It crashes constantly. I have to open and close it like 5 times before I can get it to even react to my inputs. I'm tired of reinstalling. Worst of all it's making my phone system UI crash too.",0
App ain't workin Properly. Glitch more often,0
App is quite amazing. One thing that I pick other apps over Spotify e.g YT music is the amount of music it contains that you can't find anywhere in Spotify. Over all great app tho,1
This app is amazing but the only problem I have is when I play my Playlist the next song is a whole random song that isn't in my playlist.other than that this app is amazing!!!,1
How many commercials are you going to put in a row? Never using this app again. Greedy AF.,0
I love this app i can play all the song that i want and all unreleased one it a best app,1
"I like spotify. But recently, the app keeps on crashing and when I want to update it, it doesn't work eveb though I have huge amount of storage left.",0
Absolute dogshit for podcasts. So many bugs.,0
Variety of playlist available based on your mood & fav artist. Reasonable price for student subscriptions.,0
I love very much Spotify because I can put song in some app and When l play games.,1
"The ui sucks, it's so goddamn annoying it feels like your trying to chase down a loose pet or wrangle a wild animal just to play the song you want and nothing feels clear the only benefit is you can listen to whatever you want so long as you have the patience to wait through 5 other songs or waist your little skips",0
Loving it the audio quality is perfect and the music selection is vast I enjoy listening to music using this app,1
The updated version of Spotify keeps crashing. It's pausing music when you close your phone and the app will freeze after attemptly playing two songs.,0
"Highly pleased with the Spotify app - functions very well on my phone and tablet. As a business, I respect that they have stood up against calls for censorship. It seems to be a great home to podcasts for people who want to be informed and think for themselves.",1
I just shifted to Canada and now I can't choose which song to play on my phone from my playlist and the shuffle option is gone songs are always on shuffle,0
I can't even download music no option for tht ðŸ˜  i waited my data with this app,0
"After sleeping on this service for years because it didn't do libraries like Google Play Music, I've finally switched because YoutTube Music is so awful I've dropped my requirements, and honestly I'm really happy I did, the algorithm is better the UI is nice, knocking a star off because when I'm offline sometimes my downloads take awhile to load for some reason.",0
"Excellent service and there's music for every taste, as for my own that's rock",1
Great music ,1
Lets try this for a 3rd time mabey they wont delete it this time. Its a bad app that constantly crashes and freezes. Would not recommend,0
Nice,1
I think it will be more exciting and useful if we can download and use it as ringtone,0
"It suddenly just stopped my plalist from playing properly/the right order, also it is now different then it was yesterday, and not in a good way. I can't change the order of my playlist and it keeps glitching and only playing like a fraction of the song, it might be because it wants me to go an dbuy premium or it wanted me to write this review. This app is quite fiddly, but you can still listen to songs easily if that's what your looking for",0
"App is not working, just after playing any track it crashes",0
"Good app, but lots of Add",1
Best music streaming app till date. Was not able to get the lyrics first. But when I reached them the problem was solved within 2 days. Like the support team. Keep up the good work. Hope new features will arrive soon.,0
"I'm on Spotify Premium but the experience is bad! At first it was glitching, now all my playlists are empty and I can't play any song! I can search for a song but it won't play! Even my downloads won't play anymore! My subscription fee is debited every month but I can't use the service! Disappointing!",0
"sorting podcast library by ""recently updated"" now is useless because it stopped showing the DATES they were updated! USELESS! it's a small detail, but if it ain't broke, don't ""fix"" it!",0
"Edit april 13th: you killed it, this app is currently unstable garbage. I would rather listen to CD's without skip protection in an offroad vehicle",0
"Not big on spotify but it's not too bad. Not as intuitive to navigate through as others and it's probably that, that means it's not my go to music app. My main one I find has all the same music, possibly even more, but is just easier to use.",0
The Best music supplier and you can listen to the music you like! Great choice.,1
All songs all the time but without premium the ads are a little bit annoying,0
Sometimes my music goes off and sometimes it doesn't give me the right song,0
Nothing wrong with the content but it stops playing when the screen is off. samsung galaxy tab.,0
"Love the app in general, but recently it'll stutter when the app isn't open and when I open it, the play bar will be gone. Sometimes this issue persists even if I close then reopen the app. Would really appreciate a fix",0
I love music . Nice experience,1
One of the relaxing app,1
"This app is supposed to be the number one ""0â‚¬"" music app, but it's definitely not. You can't pick the song u want, you'd just get a preview of it, you can't skip to the song u want so ur basically left to listen to something you might not like. There are ads after every 2-3 songs. On top of that you need WiFi to listen at all. The only way to listen to the song u want, peacefully is to buy premium. In this case it is not a ""0â‚¬"" music app. I wouldn't recommend it.",0
Love this app but quality of each song can still be improved to HD. Some are not up to CD Quality,1
This app is a mess. Updating and uninstalling/reinstalling hasnt fixed the latest patches not allowing me to play music. Can't believe they charge for this garbage.,0
UI could be more organized & intuitive. Otherwise not bad. But if I'm paying I expect MORE. Like never having to deal with seeing the wrong title playing at the bottom & staying stuck like that for hours! Also sudden stops for no reason! (ëˆˆâ€¸ëˆˆ),0
"Good app but it has the worst feature. I always plays suggested songs, there is a setting that is supposed to turn It off but it doesn't. I happens when you are trying to listen to song that is not in you playlist and it sucks. If you don't have premium you can't get passed it because it requires skips to get passed it and if you run out of skips you can't do anything. I hope Spotify will listen to there customers and not think about greed and money.",0
Lately there are a lot of bugs preventing songs playing fully,0
"Here, listen to new Rammstein Album! But instead of playing songs from that album we will also play random other songs! Useless app in non premium mode",0
It'd be cool if there was a feature where you could sort your liked songs from what you liked first to last instead of what's been recently liked.,0
This is a good app I am very happy to listen song's lyrics,1
"I love the application, but almost every time I open the app, it doesn't show the controls so I have to restart my phone. It's getting tiresome.",0
"Awful and getting worse. They are so worried about people not sharing accounts that they make it impossible for those of us who actually pay for it. Moved to amazon unlimited and LOVE IT! Glad they made it so hard for me, i got to try a better and cheaper service!",0
"Great app, easy to use and works well with watch os. A couple if things that makes it a 4 star is some things that I would like, such as an option to turn off 'radio based on radio', as some songs im not keen on that it chooses for me. I'd also like a playback speed feature where change the speed of songs, YouTube has this feature and I think it would be good if Spotify also had this. I have premium and I would definitely recommend it.",1
Offers very good selection of my favoured music,1
Easy-to-use software,0
Easy to find out songs,1
"Great but when I stream over wifi to my Google nest, the app just starts skipping songs and then will only play 9 seconds of a song and be quite after a while. Doesn't do this on Bluetooth or through my phone. Please fix this!",0
Why do I still get adds when I have a premium account?,0
Won't work with my cars audio system (Kenwood DDX4019BT) was working fine about a month ago but now it doesn't display or work with my car audio system,0
"Always buggy, but at least I can listen to music sometimes?",1
"Won't let me pay for premium. When I enter my payment info and tap the button, nothing happens. Lame",0
"Annoying ads, but otherwise good enough.",1
"Really irritating that everytime I select one of my playlist it just loads forever or shows a blank screen, forcing me to restart the app.",0
Hopefully this update will help to keep my screen intact. The amount of times I sometimes have to click to play 1 song is just frustrating,0
The ads have become obnoxious unless you upgrade. Used to be my favorite app. All about money.,0
"I haven't listened to any podcasts, but the music is just what I want. In any mood. Spotify always delivers.",1
"We have enough disinformation floating around already without you guys providing science deniers and conspiracy theorists a platform, paying them to produce content, and actively promoting it. I will not be renewing my Premium subscription and will be finding an alternative source for music.",0
These guys are awful. There app is okay at its best but they want a subscription and basically force it. Only aloud to skip 6 songs? Got to listen to ads after every 3 songs? I can't even chose a specific song from my playlists? Spotify used to be a brilliant user friendly app now it's rediculous. I actually used to be a subscriber now you have gone greedy the Spotify mod is the way forward ðŸ‘ Ps. Google spotify mod apk.. :) done.,0
"Superb, please add offline with download for offline listening. Overall have a great experience",1
Love that I have all these listening options with no commercials!,1
i can't even play the song i want to listen the new update sucks and it requires premium to skip a song i mean what the heck that's beyond ridiculous ðŸ˜‚,0
"It's amazing, it's so easy, it makes listing to music a hobby, because it gives you suggestions taylored to your tastes, so you don't have to search for good songs all the time!",1
I absolutely love Spotify. There are so many choices for music lovers to choose from. Thank you!!,1
"This aap is assoommm..ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°. But I want to you can please add some mining book audio like minea act 1952, mines regulations and ets ..it's help me a lot ...can you ou do something...",0
Good not bad,1
I hate it when they add random dumb songs to my playlist and I can't even remove them and the song I'm finding doesn't even pop up it's just random songs that I hate,0
"So if you don't have premium you can't play the song you want to when you want to you just have to wait for it to go through your playlist , it plays your playlist random order, it plays songs in YOUR playlist which should be full of YOUR selection with random songs they THINK you would like, you only get 6 skips per hour, it gives you up to 5 ads in a row every 6 or so songs, you can't loop, you also can't rewind, so if you don't have income to pay for premium just go to Pandora.",0
Why do shuffle have preview of songs that I already add to my Playlist it just doesn't make sense I've Been trying to play one fricken song for the past hour but it just keeps playin a preview of da songðŸ¥²:(,0
Its fun i could find every song from any music artist i choose even some old songs from back in the day,1
I don't know how people use this terrible app. Listen to YouTube or make your own Playlist on your phone. Terribly setup and crashes/freezes my computer the second the page loads. I stopped watching Joe Rogan cuz he switched to this trash.,0
"I am an ardent purchaser of music on cds i rip and play back in various ways. My children have purchased me this credit because they wanted to show me how it is for them. My verdict is good, I like the fact that i can try stuff I wouldnt normally and checking out stuff i wanted and never got round to. The cost of Â£120 for a year is a big burden for me, I doubt I spend that much on CDs as i look for the bargains and 2nd hand. You need to be cheaper to keep me.",0
Keeps crashing on my s22 ultra,0
Perfect ,1
Great application for Music listening. Works great in all situations,1
"Like to different ablums and artists on spotifiy as well,",0
Please can there be an option to download music for offline? Thank you,1
"Constantly lose the playback bar from my swipe down menu and my lock screen. It also disappeara in the app too, losing the ability to pause music or skip it. I have to force close the app to stop playback. Happens all the time.",0
I love spotify cause it helps me find the perfect playlist of songs that I describe as what I feel all the time<3,1
A great combination you have put up for music lovers Thats exceptional But i have to reinstall it after every 2 days coz it stops working thats why things are not very well for me,0
"Amazing, pick ur favorite song Artist..",1
My app hasn't worked since the last update. It's not pulling up my personal playlists or the ones already on spotify by other users. No matter what I search it shows it's an empty playlist and my username shows as random numbers and letters instead of my nickname I set. If I log in on a web browser all of my stuff is still there though. They were sure quick to take my monthly subscription payment but not to fix whatever this is. Love paying for something that doesn't work at all.,0
I have premium and can't play songs offline and podcast that I downloaded are no longer downloaded,0
It is taking a lot of time to open and sometime it's not opening . I have instal it yesterday and today it's not working so I am just uninstalling the app,0
Great App I really enjoy it for all my music!,1
Keeps stopping songs suddenly for no reason.,0
You want to add a random music button for them who dont want to search and you can play there top song from 1-100.,0
"Constantly crashes on Samsung 21 ultra! So glitchy its hardly worthwhile. If it wasnt for JRE, I would be elsewhere.",0
"Having the same issues as some other users have described , I've been dealing with it , but the constant interruption of having to press play and not being able to skip a song has began to annoy me ! Please please fix these bugs , I've been waiting for an update !",0
My play/pause/skip menu has vanished with the latest update. The only way I can find to turn off music is to close the app entirely.,0
Best streaming app ever!,1
"HORRIBLE!! If I could give zero stars I would. This stupid app automatically starts itself on my phone all the time, and I DON'T USE THE APP!! If I used it a lot, it would make more sense, but I stopped a long time ago. My only answer is to uninstall.",0
"Absolutely LOVE this app! I was with Pandora before, but this app is much better! You have a lot more choices and can organize your music the way you want to. It's a great app! â¤ï¸",1
So finally on the way to ruin the app... Good developers.. What's happening! See there are a lot of other alternatives we can easily switch to other apps.. its about a month i am seeing app to be laggy sometimes blank and in web version lyrics to be synced wrongly for all songs..,0
"Don't get me wrong, I love Spotify and it's truly a great app. My only problem is that I've been getting way too many ads. If I skip a song, I have to wait for 4 or 5 ads to play, then get back to whatever song I wanted to listen to. At this point, even YouTube is better for playing music.",1
Sound Quality of some of the older songs are pretty bad. Perhaps because the original recordings were not that good,0
"There seems to be some glitch because it keeps playing over other apps LIKE YouTube, but it used to automatically fade out. The 'play/next etc' bar also disappears during this time so I can't stop it within the App (attempted to pause it earlier from the drop down bar). The only way to close it is to close down the app completely.",0
"Most beautiful quality. So much new features, l love this. More enjoyable if taken premium membership in app. Without adds and can download the songs .",1
It keep CRASH after the last update on Vivo V23e. Please Fix it!!!,0
When you using Google Chrome on your phone Spotify will sometimes just cut off completely then restart the song your listening to and will happen multiple times in a row please fix,0
It's a good app but I wish there is not a lot of ad. Plus I wish I can download the songs without premium,0
I enjoy listening songs through spotify appðŸ’œðŸ’œ,1
App was good but The song stops again and again and we have to go in app and play it again from starting. It is just so irritating. Pls fix the issue ðŸ™ðŸ™,0
"1 ad, i could deal with, 2 ads ok whatever, BUT 3 ADS??? IN A ROW TOO???? that is so dumb, and idk why but whenever i want to look at what else is the there in an album or playlist, the ""more"" button doesnt work anymore, so i have to go through THE WHOLE PLAYLIST with only 6 skips and ADS!!! A MILLION OF ADS!! That is so stupid, if i could download anything else i would, but unfortunately this is the only app thats decent enough. Spotify please get rid of the million of ads and go back to 1",0
Love this Spotify ,1
"Randomly doesn't allow me to control the podcast I've selected to play. Will not allow me to pause, play, or go forward/backward. Very odd.",0
"It's not working, I can't pause or change, and it keeps stopping every two minutes.",0
"Look was kinda digging Spotify (Premium I might add) but, I noticed as of late I've been having two types of glitches. The first it'll randomly stop playing from time to time and I'll to grab my phone and have at. Not exactly ideal when I'm driving while listening which is like 90% of the time. My second issue, I'll be listening and the my control options will disappear. You know pause, play, all those fun little buttons. And I'll have to force my entire phone to reboot just to regain access.",0
wheres the damn repeat option this is trash with a repeat option,0
Absolutely worst app ever. If you don't have premium like this time around i couldn't take the premium. This app will show ads right after one song or sometimes in the middle that too 2 ads 30secs each continuously. This is too much now. Can't tolerate this nonsense anymore. Better to switch to some other music app.,0
"Probably the best music streaming app available at the moment. Interface is dated, though. This is where Apple Music triumphs Spotify.",0
"App not working properly after latest update. No panel at bottom of screen to set sleep timer, and will stop playing after 5 minutes. Before this update I would use it every day, but just frustrating now, won't be using until fixed.",0
"It's good but I have a beef with Spotify in that I can't get certain songs on it, and sometimes a song I have will be taken away unannounced for some reason. Last thing, shuffle play isn't great. I have 600 plus songs. I shouldn't be having the same few songs show up for days in a row. It's good though. I can barely keep up with all the recommendation playlists.",0
"Everything's great till you hear sarcastic ads... Don't want sass from an app, Spotify! There's enough of that in real life already! ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜©",1
No experience yet but I have heard a lot about it Im gonna try it,1
Great,1
Fantastic. I use the app all the time,1
I have to keep re downloading the app because the app freezes on a song or podcast episode which means it will carry on playing without the possibility to change to another episode.,0
"Love the app, if you can, get the year subscription and save a few bucks, fairly seamless google compatability, works great with google assistant",1
I love it I just wish there were more songs!! When I've tried to search for one it won't come up:(,0
I'm always on the road driving it keeps me intertained,1
the blend feature isn't working and i have tried everything to fix it. extremely disaappinted since i even pay for premium. hope they fix it otherwise I will unsubscribe,0
Worst because there is no song was started nor find,0
"Spotify as a database is superb. Unfortunately the app is built like so many these days. Their way is the only way. My biggest gripe is that although I have premium, Spotify will insist on mixing tracks rather than leaving them in order. This is every time I load an album, playlist. STOP trying to make me do what you want. I want a setting to ALWAYS change this. My choice not yours. I am paying for the privilege. I want the ability to fully customise my app. DO NOT TRY TO BE APPLE. 1/5 Score.",0
"We have family premium and normally love Spotify but it can be super annoying when I'm listening to music on my PC or something and use my phone to control it. It keeps disconnecting from the device so I have to keep reconnecting it over and over. When I change songs it won't just let me change song, I have to keep going in and out of the app so it changes.",0
Audio quality has gotten to horrible to even bother listening to,0
App is very easy to maneuver. Just wish the app would learn my music taste quicker. But otherwise the songs I do fine are easy to add into playlists.,1
kinda glitchy when i close my chromebook and open it back up(refuses to play). I usually have to open and close the app a couple of times to get it to work.,0
Fantastic choice of music day and night all year round,1
Love the app easy to use and get use to. But unfortunately sometimes whenever I miss a payment or something else some songs are unliked and taken off playlists. I don't know why this occurs but it's very often I'm adding/liking songs back to my library. Oftentimes when I switch it to offline mode and go back to settings the switch it back online is not there after a certain amount of time like couple of hours pass,0
Waow nice app with lots of music to select from endless list ðŸ‘ŒðŸ½ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ‘ ðŸ˜Š,1
"I don't like the new update. Old update I was able to find my songs, now I can't find any of my songs.",0
Not really a fan of the app constantly trying to run and play songs without my permission. Im on the samsung s20 and the app will just open up and start doing its thing randomly. Yeah no thanks,1
App. Is very good but there are too many ads in this,0
Have used this app since launch and love it!,1
"As a paid user, I'd expect to at least use the basic feature of streaming music. But all I get for the past few months is ""No Internet Connection available"".",0
I like it because I get to listen to a ton of different songs and artest.,1
After this latest update I'm having issues with Spotify connect. That's why 3 stars.,0
"Excellent music app, I enjoy it tons! It is possible to listen many artists and their best songs. Highly recommend it, for me the best music app experience.",1
love this app but if you cancel Joe you can cancel my subscription also.,0
"Spotify has been great for so many years, giving me the stain free music I like, but lately it has changed. It now looks and behaves as an algorithm based push add for EDM and poscasts. It has become ""zombify"" for the ignorant masses.",0
"It was working great up until a 4 days ago! Just keeps telling me there's an issue and won't play anything!. I've uninstalled, installed and even tried my acct on another phone with no luck. And I know my subscription will be going out in the next week and for what!!?? Please help!",0
Excellent,1
All the music I love for free with the odd commercial- how can one complain!,0
It is the best music app I have ever seen..,1
"DONT USE FOR LONG PODCASTS. This app, regardless of being free, is just way too glitchy. I'm often not able to listen to long podcasts from start to finish and need to pick up where I left off. Unfortunately spotify has some serious difficulty keeping track of where I stopped. I TRY to continue from where I paused the podcast and spotify just fast forwards right to the end or just starts a new podcast from out of nowhere. I'm forced to make mental or phone notes to keep track of where I am.",0
I can't even listen to my favourite songs in peace. There are too much ads. Downloaded it to listen to music and not some random people telling us forcefully that premium is better. Gonna switch it to some other apps. Disappointed with this app.,0
It worked great but not anymore. It's not letting me listen to anything now,0
"Good music, good vibesâ¤â¤â¤",1
You need to take off ads and Spotify premium should be free and you should skip songs and random songs come on my like play list and I don't like it,0
"The Best streaming app on the Planet. Has cast function , delivers all the latest tracks at my fingertips.",1
"Been having trouble with downloading podcasts. I never had an issue before but after the recent update I've been having issues, the downloading icon shows but then it just continues to be stuck downloading with no progress.",0
over priced. but quality of songs is really good..,1
It really good the only problem is it shows too many adds about Spotify premium so please remove it,0
"The latest mobile update is so bad and annoying. Whenever I select a certain song that I want to play, it plays another song. I am actually planning to buy Premium on summer break but not now. Please fix it",0
Excellent app with lots of good songs,1
"Better than any streaming service available, quality wise, catalogue and interface. Lately it's been a let down though, it keeps pausing mid songs. Please fix, hence the four stars rating",0
It a really good app but then there premiun why can everything be free and you can't pick what song you want to lissting to what you have on your own play list when on laptop or computer so I can't stand this app ðŸ˜®â€ðŸ’¨,0
Nice app but too many ads in it,0
Fantastic easy and quick,1
Best App I can even use hassle free I really recommend to use this app really so much people now you may not know me but trust that it's simpler than anything in the world (John Wayne) also said that about John F Kennedy.ðŸ™â˜ºï¸ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ Premote you're vote,1
I have other podcast apps but always return to Spotify.,0
I love it the best music app ever,1
"ðŸª¶.... Spotify is the absolute best music and podcast app Ever, I couldn't live without it now... Soooo much better than YouTube the fact one can play a podcast in the background whilst doing other things on my handheld device makes it an absolute cut above the rest & the amount of free quality entertainment is mind blowing..Thank you Spotify xoxo",1
"Can't join group sessions. A week ago I could now it isn't an option I have, everyone else with the link can join. I pay for features like this and they don't work.",0
Exploring n awesome experience,1
The best music streaming app ever!,1
Random log out and when I log in again with the same email and password saying that my password is incorrect. Very enjoyable music player. So I gave you my 1 star :)),1
"I have used nearly all the common music services, but there isn't anything like Spotify. Music recommendations are awesome. It could be a huge improvement if they add smoother and fast transition between menus and selection.",1
Been great for years as a paying customer and now all of a sudden i can't like any new songs. Very frustrating after years of positive experience,0
Very goodit has many different types of songs,1
Simply the best product available!,1
Extremely glitchy and buggy. Never had an inuse intil last week. will not let me pause music go forward to the next song fast forward rewind and will will not open the media player. I have no control. Debating switching to Apple music,0
Best streaming app for musics.,1
I have access to YouTube Premium & Amazon Music but Spotify takes the cake any day,0
"Great music, fantastic real podcasts!",1
The best music app by far thanks Spotify loving the app,1
Spotify has been glitching and I can't pause the music. VERY OBNOXIOUS. Literally made me scream last time.,0
"I give 4 stars bc i really loved spotify but i can't play the music that i like on my phone only on computer only that i can play and no matter what i try i just can't play the music i want just playing like, teaser music? Idk someting like that, pls fixed it cuz' i can't play music on my phone and i want it so badly. Thnx",0
Awesome music app!!I I said a long time ago that there is too many adds but now you are able of controlling it.Keep up the good work!,1
enjoy,1
The love I have for this app is unmatched. Their playlists are always A1 and the download feature is very convenient! Plus I'm always looking forward to Spotify Wrapped. 10/10 would recommend.,1
I have had spotify for 4 years and now it's crashing and to top it all of it won't let me change the cover image on my playlist's when i do it just resets the picture and the name. Any Tips??,0
My Spotify always shows no internet connection although data connection is on and because of this lyrics don't load and some features don't work. Please fix this ASAP as these are issues which degrade the quality of this app however good it is.,0
Some one is using my Spotify! I cannot get him out from Vietnam! I will lose all the music I have 466 songs!No one can help me I have no choice but to DELETE all my songs!,0
Best app for music! The free version is itself well enough and you can listen songs from various artists and it is really cool. The UI is simple and you can customize the app's interiorâ¤ï¸..I love this app!,1
"Use this app for quite a few years both as a free account and on premium. Can't say I have noticed any improvement on the premium side and the free side just gets worse. A ridiculous amount of ads, forces songs onto your playlist whether they're hidden or not, forces you to be online even if you've downloaded podcasts. It's ok if on premium, if it's the free version it's just the worst",0
"Spotify was great until all of a sudden I logged out for 1 quick second and now I can't load into the app and I'm stuck in the loading screen with the logo for the past 3 days, it'd be 5 stars if this was fixed.",0
So far pretty good. Only thing that I would like to see is your ability to show new music like Amazon music does .. and it isn't necessarily 'new' music but on the lines of what I'm listening to. I have been introduced to new artists that have been around for years and didn't know it.,1
Spotijfy is good music aap but add so much. It's problem solve spotify.,1
I love to use Spotify but when I update it the playback at my playlist is looking weird and I can't choose a song in my playlist from my phone?,0
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY TO PREVIEW SONGS BEFORE ADDING THEM TO A PLAYLIST. THAT'S SO STUPID. HOW WILL I KNOW IF I EVEN LIKE THE SONG IF I CAN'T PREVIEW IT. ADD THAT BACK RIGHT NOW OR I JUMP.,0
PLEASE BRING BACK THE HEART BUTTON FOR LIKED SONGS,1
"New update is the worst. I'll be listening to a playlist when I go to bed, sleep timer on. I'll wake up (15 minutes into a several hour playlist) and resume listening. For some reason the app decides that the playlist is now 6 songs long on the queue and ends 3 songs later. I then have to go in re-select the same song that I was already listening to to get the whole playlist to play. That's just one of many new problems. Along with some of the existing ones.",0
I love listening to this app it really is nice and relaxing. I have to mention that I prefer Spotify over Pandora,1
"App is crashing a lot , unable to use it.",0
Spotify is one of the best music apps on this planet! There are absolutely NO ads! Nothing gets in the way of Spotify's music!,1
It's Good App. No problem with this app thanku Spotify. ðŸŒšðŸŒš,1
"Buggy, doesn't play the song I choose. Right now it started a podcast for no reason. Thanks for losing my spot. Would rate 0 stars if possible. YouTube music is way better!!",0
Brilliant ap - have the paid for version. The free one is difficult to use as the songs don't play in order. But the paid for ap is fantastic.,1
"Latest update is full of bugs. One I click play, the audio starts however the player isn't accessible so can't pause, skip, stop etc. Also audio frequently stops. Have uninstalled and reinstalled but no difference.",0
"Meh. Good enough. It's been 3 years, adding 1 star cause big library and podcasts but still YouTube music does a better job with recommendations and discovering new artists that you might like.",1
"Worst designed app I've ever used. Takes ages to load downloaded content, or to download content at all. Every page seems to take way too long to load. Get any other player.",0
Spotify it is a very good app *****,1
Worst app. Too much of adds. Sooo irritating. Guys insted of this app go with gaana and wynk.,0
My experience with Spotify is TRULY an AWESOME ðŸ‘Œ one!!!! ðŸ¤œðŸ½ðŸ¤›ðŸ½,1
It is so good app but many ads are come in songs,1
It's a good app coz it makes person being happy 4 listening hot songs music,1
Very flitchy after a year of updates. Improve or stop charging me... Update. Still garbage glitchy and slow,0
no vultures album,1
"Top I love it,I hesitated to long for to many years. After all of the notifications kept coming I made up my mind and install this. Now I can't keep off, Media programðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘.",0
just too many adds otherwise everything is goood!,0
"Amazing, but I miss the ability to have all your music compiled into one playlist.",0
"Not playing in my Samsung A9 pro. Any song I select, that asks to create a play list. Even after creating the list , doesn't play. Not user friendly.",0
"Been having an issue with the latest update where it doesn't show the song at the bottom and I can't pause or play the music, it's quite frustrating",0
It's awesome to lessen all my musics But in free version Try too increase volume. When I'm traveling to clg I love to lessen music but the outdoor sound are distributing due to low volume. So please Spotify consider this thankyou,0
Never cared about using Spotify until I did. Now I cant stop!!!,0
Best app to listen music ..,1
App is so fast. Searching suggestions are available when you type any song you will find soon. It is better than ganna app.,1
"Best music streaming app in my experience. Works very well on my Samsung phone, Android Auto in my car and my Wamsung watch. Have had issues with the other big name streaming apps where Spotify works.",1
I'm enjoying discovering new voices and talent,1
Best place to find any type of music.,1
"The experience is like 3-4 30s adds so you can listen to a couple songs, or you spend roughly 5$ each month for an ok experience. I only use it because there's not much else.",0
"Love the app, however after the latest update of my Galaxy s21, I can't get it on my lock screen, probably the best feature, anyone know what's up?",1
This site is outstanding. Every band and every song I have looked for I have found without any problems,1
Spotify used to be a brilliant app and I have always enjoyed listening music on it but this new update is simply pathetic. It is now only usable for premium users. Non premium cannot even listen to the music of their own choice without shuffle. I cannot rewind or repeat the song and have to bear the playlist I don't want to listen.,0
I love this app because I can make my own playlists the only thing is I yhink you should be able to listen to it whereever without premium,0
Very clear sound,1
Amazing app with amazing music and stand by principles. Will recommend for everyone!,1
"Amazing, love it!",1
"It was good but there are many songs that it won't let me play and it doesn't want to update. For example it won't let me listen to maroon 5 , Camila Cabello, or Karol G",1
Best music application ever,1
"Sooooo glitchy. I've paid for this app for many years but can't anymore. It keeps pausing itself, closing itself, skipping back several minutes, and many other problems. I've had these problems for months now thinking it'll get fixed. Well I'm moving into a different app now. Will check back in a year.",0
I like it but I wish I could skip more songs,0
Recent update took away the navigation buttons I can't pause or skip back or forth. I have to clear my apps is the only way to turn off music. I will cancel subscription if not fixed soon,0
This new update is not good at all i can't even listen to my playlists anymore I'm going to delete this app,0
Best music app out there,1
"I wish i could give this app negative stars. Horrible app, all i want to do is listen to a podcast nope it lags and buffs. I restart my phone and sometimes itll play without lagging but lately its lags even if i restart. Terrible app. I used to watch every joe rogan episode i think ive watched 3 since he switched to this terrible company",0
"Swapped to free version after constantly losing functionality each update. If you're going to use Spotify, you'd be silly to keep paying.",0
Ek chiz ke liye accha hai ki ek taraf gana baja sakte or dusri taraf Instagram me live aa sakte hai,1
I really liked this app.It works well after exhausting my daily data limit.This app uses less data and also the sleep timer is very helpful for me fall asleep.Its helps in good listening to music.I really liked this app that is why am giving five stars.I will suggest this app for all music listenors.I can't get lyrics in my phone hope that fix it soon so that i give four stars where lyrics are available in other phones.,1
Too much ads,0
"I paid for subscription, but the system not recognize my acc as premium user",0
Meh it's good............ Sike!!! It's the best app for listening podcasts and music and there's a lot of things you can learn with this app. Keep up the good work!!!!,1
"Love the app and the ease, but the thing that lets it down most is the integration with Google Assisstant. Asking it to play one track and you get a completely different one. I don't know which end has the issue but it definitely causes a lot of headaches.",1
"Great love the music and the easy of it all, keep up the great work.",1
"I've been paying for the premium for over a year now. So far a relitavley good experience. I planned a week camping trip and download podcasts and some albums for the trip where there isn't signal. None of the downloaded songs were able to play and all it say was ""you're offline"". I pit my trust in Spotify to entertain me on this trip and I was let down. Please try fix this. And yes my app was updated.",0
Excellent variety of music. Thanks. Recommended.,1
"Love Spotify, I never drive without connecting!!",1
Music for any mood at your finger tips,0
I HATE SPOTIFY AFTER PLAYING 2 SONGS ADS COME AND AD IS OF 30 TO 40 SECONDS. I RECOMED EVERY ONE UNINSTALL THIS APP,0
Best best best song best app best quality best adds best premiums best every thing in this app.,1
Love it been an avid user of spotify and premium since 2016 my go to music destination ALWAYS.,1
Love it. Perfect. But has a lot of bugs in Georgia. Dunno about other countries,0
The app is great but my problem is when I play a game with music it stopped and when I play the music for a while it crashed/stopped I really hate when that happens.. Pls fix it ðŸ˜”ðŸ™,0
"Useless App mega bugs very frustrating to use. Other music apps auto start in my car. This version of Spotify does not, it used to autostart. Once you get Spotify running podcasts and music will randomly stop. I'm seriously thinking about stopping my premium membership.",0
Everything works great for finding the music you like haven't Cracced into everything on it yet,1
Spotify is simple and has everything I want to hear. It is great for road trips or just having some music on at home.,1
When are you going to fix this bug that makes the play bar disappear,0
I am just love it ,1
I've been unable to update my payment method/card.,0
"Spotify doesnt play the whole song most people complained.. I cleared cachae, data, and uninstalled it...it didnt work..im getting a better appðŸ¤ªðŸ¤žðŸ¤‘",0
"I don't know if it was the new update, but I haven't been able to play Spotify in my vehicle now, Bluetooth connects just fine, it shows it connected but for some reason now the Spotify can't connect and play, please fix this",0
"Constant issues with this app, scared every time there's a new update as it just seems to break something else. Constant connection issues even with full signal, and random pausing even after following the instructions online to remedy this. Would rather use 2 separate apps for music and podcasts than use this one app for everything and THAT is more convenient Also why have the JRE podcast and then break it with ads that skip entire episodes? What a frustratingly terrible app experience! 0 stars",0
"Spotify is a good service, but I have so my trouble with the app. Crashing, playing when paused, not showing that anything is playing when it is playing, more crashing. I've reinstalled the app to fix the problem then it'll come back. Fix the app.",0
Its best,1
"It's really good, I like how they have podcasts but they also have music.",1
I think it is a best aap from you can listen and learn music it makes a playlist of your favourite songs.............,1
"Mini player doesn't exist anymore. Can play songs but nothing else cuz i can't get in the song. Soo bad at knowing and connecting when my Wifi or Data is turned on. I have to reset it every time, I want to switch from offline mode to online.",0
Much better than Pandora or Apple and YouTube music hardly any ads Also you can choose your song of choice,1
It's a very nice app. I like it and I have always liked it. I just hope they reduce the ads for those who aren't using premium.,1
"Absolute trash. Why does something that I downloaded to my phone, need to buffer? Why does the app glitch out and not play anything, but then says it's been fully watched? Terrible....",0
I just did an update and I have no way to update my payment option. ðŸ˜¡,0
"Very very good experience.. But since last fews days I am facing 1 prob. When I play anything there's no bar or screen which shows play, puase, forward , backwrd doesn't show up while playing. I have to restart to get that. Plz resolve this ASAP..",0
Great app tons of music,1
I love Spotify just Awesome â¤ï¸,1
This app is so good,1
Very goodðŸ¤› ExcellentðŸ‘Œ in sound quality And so impressive in song shuffling What a brilliant platform like Spotify âœ…,1
Messes up a lot lately on my android not happy I have to restart my phone at least twice a day.,0
"Great service when subscribed, but terrible free service with way too many adds and basically no features except shuffle plau on a phone",0
Noice app ðŸ‘ but should work on lyrics interface.It looks quite boring,0
"I love Spotify, I've been a premium member for years. It is normally a 5-star service. This review/low rating is specific to the recent update. Since the update, when shuffling my liked songs, it will loop the same 15-20 songs. My partner is experiencing the same problem. Please fix this Spotify ðŸ˜",0
Great music collection,1
The app stopped working and will not open past the logo screen. Have tried everything for days and still can't even login.,0
"Extremely nice to enjoy with the ease of saying hey spotify...just wish I could listen to my Playlist when I'm at work,where there is no cellular signal.",1
"Unfortunately 0 cannot be given. Spotify, both the app & web is the most unusable and unintuitive user interface ever created. Shame :(",0
"I have a hassle with this one, I have to go to browser to pair and it suck",0
App freezes and stops playing playlists on its own. Constantly need to reboot or hit play again during playback. Had premium but cancelled because of this annoying issue.,0
"07/12/2021 i got charged for my premium subscription but can't use my premium perks(?) is there a reason why it always show i can't go online or whatever (?) and now i can't logged back in on my acct. 05/15/2022 i want to cancel my subscription, but i can't find it anywhere now :(",0
I really like Spotify because I went back and got some songs that I haven't even thought about or heard in years and I really greatly appreciate you guys keep up the good work.,1
I can't hear my playlists it only chooses for me,0
"Normally, I would give this app a 5 star rating, but I'm not sure what's going on; I can't listen to my playlists without it playing on shuffle, and the button to turn it off is missing; whenever I open the app, it crashes as soon as I play music; and I'm not sure if it's just my phone, but it makes for a very unpleasant listening experience.",0
The update is sucks now shuffle can't be undone .. pls bring back when we can only choose the one we want.,0
"A great place to catalog your music, but but everytime they update this app. They make it objectively worse. For some reason everytime they make it harder to find tour music and it infuriates me to no end",0
"Great app!! Best to listen to music, podcasts, etc.",1
"Spotify really? You add thi gs to playlist even if that feature is turned off, you don't ask to add things and removing those songs counts a skips which you can only have 6 of UNLESS YOU BUY PREMIUM also, all of the you won't get another add for 30 minutes doesn't work so Spotify is just money hungry.",0
"Meh with the new update With the new update (Somewhere in april 2022 is when I got it) it hides the playback tab so I can't skip repeat, or even see what songs are on. It's fine for music, it's actually my go to, but that is annoying enough to bring down my rating by three stars.",0
I absolutely love Spotify I have been using it for years unfortunately recently when I go to add songs to a playlist I can't click on it to hear a preview of that song and I really do not like that it was one of the most helpful features in my opinion:(,1
Great. I found all my favorites from when I was growing up.,1
Nice app i love it and its easy to use,1
My phone app is telling me I don't have premium and keeps glitching,0
It Very Nice you can listen whatever you want andit is free . And is better from ganna app,1
Amazing,1
This app is very good ,1
I like the simple fact that it creates my own playlist from the songs that I listen to the most and just a variety of music that they have and now they audiobook ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜œðŸ“±ðŸ”Œ,1
This is not app this is life for depressed one to come out of depression,0
Great podcasts. Love Joe Rogan. He can make most any guest intetesting and able to ferret out information beneficial to the general public,0
Just the best music app but the ads are pretty frequent well thats expected I think we are using this app for free,1
Love Spotify on every platform.,1
"The app keeps doing weird things like the play button and skip buttons disappear and the app sometimes ask me to log in, but I'm already logged in. Since the last update things got really bad in this app making the user experience difficult!",0
"What wrong with your Update. We cant even play the Music that we really want. We have to play most of the music before we can play the music that we desire. And whats more, you cant ""NEXT"" after six Try. Omg,. Nice nice. Super. Super annoying.",0
Spotify speeches are better than other sites That's why I like it,1
"Every time I want to use this app since the latest update, I have to uninstall and reinstall it because the play button stops working. Please fix it.",0
"Not sure what happened in this recent update. I no longer get the bar at the bottom of the screen when playing anything. I have to force close the app, reopen it, then play that media again, to get the bottom bar back.",0
I got premium and in account details Spotify is free it is showing but still i am getting ads. I don't know why and what is happening.,0
Shuffle play was fine. Don't know why they want to remove that option. I'm playing a song in my playlist and after that it keeps on playing songs not in playlist. What is the purpose of having a playlist if it won't play my playlist. Worst thing ever,0
"It's a really good app for music but I rate it a 4 star because there are 4 ad's after some songs, and I think that it's annoying to listen to a 30 seconds of 4 ad's. ( In my opinion )",0
I love Spotify especially playlists and the premium features,1
"After the new update spotify has stopped auto playing with my Ford Focus 2014 SYNC! Before it used to start playing my music automatically from where I left off as soon as I turned the car key. But now I have to manually open spotify & start my playist & also keep spotify app open. If I close the app it stops automatically playing & my widget also goes blank & unresponsive when pressing the play button! Please sort this if possible. Using a Samsung S10 Lite, worked perfectly before update.",0
I am in love with Spotify as I can hear any type of song any time anywhere... First of all I am a BTS ARMYðŸ’Ÿand Spotify help me a lot to listen to their music ðŸŽ¼ anytime I want. When I am happy as well as sad Spotify help me a lot with its musics. I am a music lover as well. To all music lover I am suggesting to download this app without wasting any time. I love ðŸ’œ you Spotify.,1
I'm getting served adds in the middle of podcasts that are exclusive to Spotify when I have a premium account!!,0
"I love the app, just lazing around listening to old jams is my thing.!!!",0
Great Music Streaming with very smart recommends Playlist Remarks: I Would like for more Japanese music in Thailand's zone,1
Most of the songs I loved can be found here. Easy to use. Great experience!,1
"I just purchased 3-month premium earlier. Downloadin songs for offline purposes worked well, but I realized I can't even play it when I'm offline. What happened? I also read same issues with others and I'm not the only one encountering it. I tried updating the app (I thought it's in my app version was the problem), but it was not, please fix this A.S.A.P.",0
Beautiful beyond words to expressd,1
Nice,1
"30 minutes ad free is not working at all, even when the app is running and no skipping of ad. However it keeps saying ""enjoy your next 30 minutes ad free"". If it's not 30 minutes ad free, don't give wrong information.",0
I wish I could gives this app 0 stars because it gives me 10 apps to hear music I hate this app,0
I really like the app but I have some lag issues but then again it's really good,1
I've had a subscription for five years but I cannot support a platform that spreads covid misinformation. I've canceled my subscription and will be taking my business elsewhere.,0
"amazingy responsive when jumping from one track to another with almost no delay. Can also stream directly to certain wifi enabled sound systems that provides much better sound quality than using bluetooth. Not all artists have their music on this platform is a limitation - but most do. I would score it much higher, but it throws up problems when there is no internet signal - even for music that has been downloaded to the device. Found this out on recent camping trip in Scotland, very frustrating",0
Seriously I loved Spotify a lot!! But lately its just not working.. having network issues with this app only.. doesn't load any songs or playlist.. all other apps work just fine with my network but not this.. please fix this issue,0
I would have given it a 5out of 5 but not bc it don't let me replay a song,0
Best app I have came across. I recommend this to all music lovers,1
Excellent at guessing what kind of music I'd like to hear next. Always a great listening experience.,1
"Spotify keeps randomly pausing my music, and it keeps asking I want to allow Bluetooth control every time I open my phone. This is really annoying I'm so close to canceling my subscription and moving to Apple music.",0
It got good music from the chat,1
"I downloaded this app because a friend told me about a couple of albums he found. So far I'm not impressed and will probably remove it soon if I can't stop certain things from happening. First, I opened a song as a test. Now every time I open my tablet that song is showing as a notification. I can't seem to get rid of it. This is beyond annoying. Second, it has linked to every device in my house. I only want my TV and tablet, nothing else.",0
"Spotify changed my whole world after my son told me about it years ago. What? They have full albums? They have albums from the 70's?? Tears were shed as I would have a musical memory, do a quick search, and bam! The Best of Bread, Twin Sons of Different Mothers, Rumours --it doesn't get any better than this. Totally worth it people.ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—",1
"On Premium. Music randomly stops every 5-10s when phone is locked and Spotify not showing up in status bar. Issues seemed to have started over the weekend, i.e. after the latest Spotify update. Actually mental that a basic function of the app is bugging out like this - please fix this",0
Super,1
"While Spotify is usually good for discovering new music, the personalization of song- and artist radios could use some adjustment. Currently they tend to be a bit oversaturated with songs Spotify knows I like.",0
"Not sure if anyone reads these, but the latest Android version (8.7.36.923) keeps crashing and loading very slowly. The app is semi-unusable. Again. Do you even do beta testing at all? his is my favorite app for streaming albums, playlists, and podcasts. What is up for the recent push for videos? The chief beauty of Pandora is its ability to play in the background!",0
"The lyrics are not showing no matter what I do? Is there any way to fix it? I updated to the latest version, cleared my cacha and data and re-installed it too but it still does not show and I'm on a premium plan",0
Too many commercials ...,0
"I've been using Spotify for years it's a huge part of everything I do, from traveling to the gym.",1
I like everything about this app,1
"Premium user for 7 years but the app just does not work anymore! The play button is missing, and the app just stops working every 30 seconds when on mobile data!! What am I even paying for at this point? Even when the songs are downloaded and I am ""offline""!! And you can't speak with a human about these issues, there is no telephone number!! Soooooo disappointed ðŸ˜ž. Im also looking into other music options now",0
"Easy to use, play lists are east to do",0
It has great and good music but they should have my favorite is Pitbull but they do have some but wish they had all of alot at least but only have like 5,1
Great app i love it and i aslo love subscription methods in this appðŸ˜it save money lot,1
Good place to listen to music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ ðŸ˜Œ ðŸ™Œ ðŸ‘Œ,1
It is perfect app because I got every song i want But in ganna i don't use to get,0
"First of all i have it for like 1year now and it super works but rights now It didn't let me in i tried to uninstall it but it still didn't, pls fix this",0
Good ,1
"Buggy mess, now playing bar keeps disappearing.",0
I love the app. I do wish there was a way to remove songs from the recommended section at the bottom of the playlist that way you could get new recommendations without having to hit refresh a bunch of times.,1
"Type in a song I want to hear, screen shows that song, I press play, Spotify starts playing NOT that song. Garbage",1
Perfect app for quality music,1
WHY THE HECK WOULD YOU ADD 4 ADS? LIKE MAN LET ME LISTEN TO MUSIÃ‡,0
"Amazing UI, stunning audio quality. Also more Arabic content is a must ðŸ™ðŸ¼. Damn spotify added lyrics, I'm in love ðŸ˜â¤. Edit: last few updates broke spotify, broken player controls, can't control through the watch or other bluetooth devices, please fix it!!!!",1
Too many advertisments,0
Need deeper cuts. Less politically correct music and commercials.,0
Otp sending is very slow Non sense loding,0
They let us listen to whatever I want and I just love it!!!,1
"Great music and streaming app. They make you great Playlist and find you new music that, the chances are you will like. The improvements I can think of for this service is to cast the podcast you're listening onto another device, and to have the music video playing in the background for different songs.",1
"keeps malfunctioning, volume levels jump even though i don't have this problem on the desktop app. often won't display in the status bar. many things fixable with a restart but overall annoying bugs",0
Been using zpotify for pro ably the last 7 years? Never an issue!,0
i give it 4 out of 5 bc the app is amazing and the one problem.. Can you please fix It on mobile i cant pick a song remotely.. only i can pick a song is in a computer .. in mobile you need to wait a billion songs before your fav song plays.. pls fix it,0
"New bug where music option dissappear, I can't change, pause rewind or skip, have to delete app to get it working",0
"It has deleted all playlists including any playlist I click on the web, can't play anything. Uninstalled the up for good, after using it for 5-6 years.",0
"I loved the app and used it constantly, almost every day. But now since the preview song feature has been removed, I barely use the app anymore, as it helped me build playlists as well as helped me discover new songs I liked. It makes no sense why this feature has been removed.",0
It would be 5 star but the album cover art is not loading messing with my experience,0
I like the app very much but randomly while i am doing other activities in my phone the song starts playing randomly in the background every 2-3 minutes,0
Nothing is perfect but I've been using Spotify for 4 years non stop and I can't complain if they add audio books here soon to that would be great,0
Its good but the random thing makes me hate it at times,0
"Dissapointing Experience on Chromebook. The app is not user friendly, there a lot of things you can't do compared to Windows. It also stops randomly and closes on me while I'm trying to us it.",0
Perfect always has what im looking for.. Highly recommend the family plan if you have kids/teens.,1
Awesome but a little messed up cause when music plays on it the music fades in and out and skips a little alot.,0
Crashes frequently. Sometimes works only on wifi. Should work on technical bugs rather than spending on advertisements only.,0
Just enjoy being able to listen to all types of music that I like,1
Very bad experice it play song without my selected even i play selected my playlist  but next song it take randome and ply unexpected songi remeve from phone,1
I personally enjoy your app it's cool an fun very easy to use thank u,1
Absolutely no way of using group sessions... Instructions don't help at all Running on Huawei P30 pro,0
"Player disappears, so cant pause, play or rewind. Is great other than that, but screws up too often.",0
How come I am not able to do the share lyrics feature? Currently using premium and always updated to the latest version.,0
Very nice to hear â¤ï¸ songs any time any were very good engetic Experience,1
I would love an option to rename playlists on android mobile,0
I used to love this app but since the update I've had to uninstall n reinstall it about 3 times because it keeps freezing up.. i pay for the service and id love for it to stop freezing on me.,0
Casting to other devices has recently been causing issues: a few seconds delay between the time stamp and the actual audio. Pausing and resuming while playing on other devices (alexa) will jump a few seconds per pause/play,0
Easy to use easy to follow on your own playlists easy ion all,0
Good app but too much ads,0
"This app was greater in the old days, but now? It's absolute garbage! I can't get rid of the bottom play button and I can't play my playlist songs separately!! And therr are alot of bugs, MAKE SPOTIFY LESS CONFUSING AND EASIER TO USE!! AND FIX YOUR APP!!!",0
Just a wonderful app to use! Every band with all of their music at your fingertips! No complaints!,1
I luv this app! Amazing performance. I gave 4 stars cuz the ads are a little annoying,0
I've been enjoying this app for years but lately I'm having second thoughts. The app refuses to connect to the internet except I turn on a VPN. Fix this please. Thanks,0
OVERALL EXPERIENCE IS OP BUT I THINK SPOTIFY SHOULD GIVE ITS PREMIUM FEATURES FOR 2 DAYS TWICE IN A YEAR,0
"Create Playlist and maintain similar artist programs, excellent sound",1
After years of listening to other apps Spotify has won me over.,1
Makes me listen to 20 songs before playing the song i requested. And the unlucky part - they are songs i don't like + 3 min long. I'll change my review if you fix these.,0
"You can't choose specific songs without paying... So this is basically just the radio... Still with ads... There's no reason to use this service ever, can't believe anyone would give them money, I'm afraid to see what their 'premium' service actually offers",0
Randomly skipped songs in my playlists wasting my 6 skips Also it is impossible to report within spotify because of a fake email verification,0
"It's the best app for music lovers . You can get all types of music, podcasts shows available. Thanks to producers",1
Great music selection and so easy to use,1
"The old app was good, but this update just forces you to buy premium. The songs have even more ads, you can't listen to your songs peacefully and plays a random song on your playlist. You even put shuffles on a cooldown.",1
Love the intuitive play lists.,1
Downloaded podcasts dont work offline but nusic does. Tired of asking via forums for a fix,0
Very good app for listenind every type of musicðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—,1
I love this app. Gets me through my days at work and while doing chores. Highly recommend. Music is life!!!!,1
"Bruh if I cancel premium 40 emails telling me to come back isn't gonna do it not even a single one of those emails had a discount Spotify be like "" have u considered renewing or signing up again"" stfu please ðŸ™ðŸ’€",0
Everything Ok But When I Take Song Back It stuck in One Place Not Play either it runs auto Please fix this glitch it sucks alot,0
I'm still in college and I can't continue the student premium so I guess screw the customer and loose a customer for good.,0
Music completely stops and to get anything to work I have to kill the app and reopen.,0
Always solid audio quality very few glitches to the app and when there are any glitches they seem to fixed them quickly! Also daily mixes are the best thing ever! And plenty of podcasts if that's more your avenue,1
"NOT ANYMORE ðŸ’” Used to like it a lot because FREE version allowed me to play LIKED SONGS without SUGGESTIONS I want to skip!! (6 skips an hour) It's already a pain not to be able to create playlists, the annual earnings are lower due to COVID. Wanted fulI version asap cause i miss so much having lots of playlists of many styles of music being 52 yrs of age. I was a teen in the 80's. Went through phases of disco, rock, punk, R & B, country, pop, etc..",0
"Was really good but a slight change was added and made it worse. The change was that when adding songs to a playlist, you no longer can listen to a 5 second Clip of the song. This makes it incredibly annoying to figure out what song you would like especially when looking for new songs",0
Best app for listening music,1
Keeps all my music but minor ajusents need to be made,0
Not instling the a Pp,1
"*UPDATE* Still no response re my emails. So disappointed. Time to cancel services I think. The status band from the bottom of the screen is gone. I can't pause, skip forward or back etc and it makes navigating the app frustratingly difficult. I have emailed a help request twice now with no response. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I've logged out and back in. Still nothing. For an app I pay a premium price for I would think somebody would interested in resolving the issue.",0
Always advertising appears and I hates it's like I listening music in YouTube.,0
My music is downloaded; so why does it always have to load it. I literally have to turn my phone on airplane mode to get things to load sometimes,0
Only if there was an option to get rid of shuffle play on phoneðŸ“± without getting premium.,0
Love this app and I love Spotify best music app out there,1
I love it and hate it at the same time. I want to able to skip songs when it's an artists playlist. But other that that you good.,1
"Honestly the app has been oddly slow and clunky lately, not playing after locking the phone sometimes, out of no where, and I the only reason I can figure is a bad back end code like some friends have been teeling me those years. I dont want to but i may have to go to youtubeM spotify... DO SOMETHING... IM TRYING TO LOVE U",0
I wanted to give a suggestion if there could be language translation of the songs while listening to different language songs in english it would be amazing.,1
"Harder to use each update. uses a ton of data, but wont work correctly in offline mode. Good luck listening to podcasts. Not user friendly any more, used to be great. Randomly shuffles. Have had premium for about 6 years now, starting to rethink, not worth 9.99 a month. If you only listen to music on shuffle on WIFI, this is the app for you.",0
Its a very very bed app this app mathates chens with you thank you,1
Great music selections. Easy to use and build great music Playlist. Have recommended it to all my friends. Check it out.,1
Maganda na sya quality napaka subrang quality as in,1
Nice app to review music..keep up the great job.,1
"I'm putting my stars down to 3 for the moment so that I can report an issue. I'm trying to add music to my Playlist, but it no longer let's me preview a snippet from the tracks so I can't tell what the pieces sound like before I want to add them into my Playlists.",0
Runs a little slow on my phone but overall it is my go to for podcasts.,0
"The app was great up until now with a few problems that were bearable. But since the last few days, its not working in my car at all, it's stopping mid song when playing on the phone. Not sure what is wrong, but this needs to be resolved soon. Also, the shuffle play keeps playing the same songs out of a list of 100s of songs, which gets super annoying. It also randomly gets out of the playlist and starts playing some other recently listened songs.",0
"Very worst app, I got too much of ad when move to another song. I wish to say use offline music app for better Experience",0
A few bugs every now and again. Recently it has been booting me out the app. Bugs usually fixed in good timing.,0
A very good app if you have Spotify Premium,1
Spotify application crashing in my vivo V21 . Can't play any music,0
The app is becoming more and more unstable with every update. I am an Android 12 User. No feature works as it should. Lyrics aren't shown correctly I have to restart app to see lyrics with each song. It doesn't remember which song I was listening to when I used the app last time. It also doesn't show the notification I have to open the app again and again. It's such a drag using the app.,0
"Why does it keep redownloading my music? I keep my downloads on my SD card, but they keep redownloading on the main storage of my phone. It's so annoying. Please fix this issue.",0
I love how I can make my own play list.,1
Thi app is straight garbage it doesn't allow me to listen to my favorite songs now it literally gives me a preview an when I go to find them it shows the album but with no song an only lyrics plz undo update or change this thank you andim not keeping ur app its getting deleted.,0
"Pays poorly compared to other services. Also decides to mess up when there's no internet connection, so that's fun. After all this, they increased prices in a sly way by only warning of your current subscription going up, not others. And now the app is going all wonky. If you're increasing prices, increase the quality, not lower it. Tried moving songs to SD card, had to force shut app then reinstall it.",0
"Science the last update, I haven't been able to hear songs from my liked list and it only plays a small fraction of songs. Also I get 6 skips per hour when I try to skip a song from a playlist which is the only thing I can hear. Tragic, bring back the old simple Spotify.",0
Love them but everytime they update (I do not have automatic updates) commercials start. It is absurd and inappropriate to force one to download newest update or face ads even if they are Premium members since 2016... Update: This issue continues to persist,0
"Good but not enough, there is a lot of trouble when you are conected to other devices through the website or even from my mobile device, some issue with connection to music library and the app is not able to play any song for a long time-frame, already update and reinstalled the app, but is the same issue and then suddenly starts working again",0
The last 4-5 days have been really buggy. The play keeps crashing every 30 seconds. A real pain when im driving,0
"Very much like another poster. When I am listening to a podcast, the controls disappear and I have to close the app to get the controls to reappear. This limits me from pausing, rewinding and don't see how much is left etc.",0
Very good app for music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ but primum ads are use less ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ also songs are in low quality ðŸ˜°ðŸ‘¿ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜ŸðŸ¤,0
Good but there's a lot of ad :(,1
The fk Pu,1
Very nice application.User friendly.,1
I'm new to this app though I tried to download some music but can't because I was requested to pick premium where I will be charged monthly .I thought that Downloads should be made free.,0
"Cumbersome, a poor user interface, why does Tori Amos play when I select Underworld ..... WT..!",0
Limited song shows up in the list when accessing Spotify through Android Auto.,1
I used to like this app until the got rid of playing a specific album for an artist and some of the other features.,0
wonderful,1
Love Gracie's corner and the many podcasts available.,1
"Ads are so intrusive these days, playing even in the middle of a song",0
"I did give this app 5 stars and am a premium supporter but it has gone to sh**! Constantly glitches, shuts down or doesn't show play bar and the only way to shut it off is to force stop on the app.",0
Great selection of music!! Love it and grateful,1
"After this last update, my app keeps opening and crashing. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but to no avail did that work. Such a shame because this would have been a 4 star review. I hope they fix this issue soon",0
"Love Spotify. Has all my music still feel the same, I just wish I didn't have to watch as many commercials, oh well.",0
Its very difficult to speak with any customer service people,0
Latest version does not work. It will stop playing songs after a while. The player is disappearing after a few songs.,0
Nice music experience with this app,1
I like it you can also set your alarm to a lot of things even podcasts and more,1
Great way to listen to your favourite tunes and discover new ones that you may not have come across otherwise. Love it,1
Not bad but lots of little glitches and problems,0
Very reliable. Good sound quality and good music variety.,1
Great platform to stream music ðŸŽ¶,1
Easy for a novice to use!,0
"1 star for attention, I love the app. But, I have an issue with the ""hide on playlist"" button. Just because I do not want this song on the playlist I'm playing, does NOT always mean I don't like the song. I may still want it on my Favorite list. DONT make it a one-or-the-other only option. Also, why do I need to waste a skip when I do hide a song? Like I said, I may like the song, but don't want it on the list I'm playing.",0
"Spotify never downloads the whole of my downloaded playlist, so I end up having to use my own data or only listen to a couple of songs. Especially frustrating when running. Also it is never consistent about how podcast episodes are sorted - I'd like to be able to filter out played episodes with the newest episode at the top by default, but that isn't possible. I pay student price at the moment, and when that ends I don't plan on paying full price - I expect better functionality for my money.",0
"My experience was subpar at best. Who working for Spotify thought making the free plan shuffle only? That is the dumbest design choice I have seen in some time, and I am saying that knowing Youtube removed the dislike button. If I made a playlist I should be able to listen to it in whatever fashion I see fit, not use six skips and wait an hour to hear the song I wanted to listen to an hour prior. Change that and maybe you will be worth a better rating.",0
"It's just a great music app but comes with its own shortcomings... The equalizer tends to automatically disable whenever you click next or select different music without the use of the â€œNextâ€ . U would have to go and reactive it again. That sucks anyways. Apart from that, it's all good.",0
It was really good but now they are trying to make you buy premieum just to listen to basic songs and skip through playlists,0
"Been running into a bunch of bugs recently. The most annoying is that I can't add more than one thing to the queue. If I keep adding, it will just erase the previous addition and I have to restart my phone several times to get it to work. Every now and then the control bar will disappear so I can't pause whatever I'm listening to even if I try from my headphones. Not to mention the random freezing and shutting down that has been more frequent lately. I've reported it before, never heard back",0
"Sometimes it says I'm offline even tho I'm using a crt wifi like I'm in online net is working perfectly.but, it says I'm offline",0
While it's fufills the needs of music when I make a playlist and I delete a added song it doesn't mean I want another one Spotify so ya the added songs really doesn't help when I have to pay 10 dollars(which I'll never do) just so I can listen to a song I actually enjoy. without skipping a couple of songs to hope to get the correct song I want to listen too,0
I can't play the song I want everytime that i play the exact song i want it suddenly play random song that i didn't even want,0
yall trippin like nobody cares if u have a problem with spotify just listen to ur music and stfuðŸ˜,0
"The app isn't even functional anymore. It's never been a good app but at this point I can't even use it right. It is horrible with downloads, it says that it's downloaded when it's not repeatedly, it never finishes downloads and it doesn't download as many as it's supposed to, now it won't show me what's playing or allow me to skip or anything, it can't open anymore unless I restart my phone, it's just seriously such a terrible worthless garbage app. It's so buggy it's ridiculous",0
"My playlists either keep Stopping after a song has ended (this includes if I skip a song or after and ad) or plays songs that aren't in my playlist constantly never playing ones that are in my playlist, I use this app everyday as I constantly listen to music and I thought this would be a good app but lately I've had nothing but trouble with it",0
The music quality is excellent.,1
Spotify the best in music and where you recover your soul,1
I was impressed with the volume of great artists n music in this free app much Thanks!,1
"It's hard to listen to songs that u want to listen to. You need to be Premium on spotify. Please, i do not like the new spotify update ðŸ˜’. The only way is to listen to it on shuffle.",0
"I'm sick of it, Spotify, please stop adding songs to Play lists. I get. You want us to try something new but it's getting annoying",0
Too many ads,0
I'm not enjoying how on mobile u can't click the right song u want to play u have to skip or find it yourself please make it like pc how u can pick the song u want to listen to thanks!,0
the experience is great. i love all the songs and the playlist that i can make can be ove 27 hours.,1
Sure would be nice to have a changelog for updates so we know what changes.,0
Sometimes it plays and won't pause or pull up the play bar when listening to podcasts. Im new to Spotify and im wondering if I should find a different app to use. Seems to to have bugs that need fixed.,0
Really good app,1
7 ads in one go that's too much,0
Love,1
"All I wanted to say is this app has features that blow ""Pandora"" out of the water! Great library of selections to choose from! ðŸ‘",1
I <3 spotifyyy but the ads are annoying and way too long i dont got money to pay for premium tho so....ðŸ˜ž,0
Nice music quality,1
From which day I have download this app Spotify from that day I am interest to listen musics and I like this App a lot thank you.,1
Super,1
O-boy this app is amazing ! I don't have any music and I don't haven't gotten any cash and I don't spoke good.so much free music here that I can get to hear and load on my player to going outside with. They tell ME ACTUALLY HOW AND SHOW ME THE WAY TO GET IT DONE BY MYSELF AND I CAN SEE WHY YOU ARE SO SWEET TO GET IT DONE BY MYSELF !....Liam O'Reilly ðŸ¤ðŸ’œðŸ–¤ðŸ’šðŸ’™ðŸ‘‘â˜˜ðŸðŸŽ–ðŸŽ—ðŸ¤¾â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¾â€â™‚ï¸ðŸŽ‰ðŸ³ï¸â€ðŸŒˆðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª,1
I love it..its the only music app that i take with me wherever i go,1
Sometimes the app closes down while I'm still listening.,0
I am on mobile and it only shows me my download episodes ðŸ™ƒ. I have internet but can you update it? that would be great ðŸ‘.,1
"Almost useless in free mode, you can't play any song you actually want, only playlists of other songs you didn't want to listen to, and you had to watch a 30 second ad for the pleasure of not hearing the song you want. UI makes everything more difficult too.",0
Paid accounts still have advertisements on podcasts,0
Just what the doctor ordered. Relaxing and soothing music.,1
"Not too long of ads, can play psn and listen to music come from my headset.",0
"The music suggestion is so poor. It automatically plays 3 same songs no matter what genre I was listening to, then, at the end of the year, it will tell me this song was played for X minutes. Well of course it was played so many times if the app itself plays it automatically. Instead of new albums and songs to discover it recommends me songs I already gave like to. Y'all get some help with your suggestion mechanism.",0
Its ok for what it is  lower output volume when loudness normalization so the whole time it was just 1 setting making it have a low output volume although it seems to have a decent audio quality  not as good as Deezer or Amazon music but it is a good app for the most part Has a tone of ads on the free version,1
"The previous problem was solved, however now everytime I swap back to the app. It takes me to the top of the playlist, and when you have 400 songs in a playlist that's quite annoying",0
"Very decent app to listen music, the ads do irritate a bit, but that's fine since it's free!",1
Great way to hear your favorite music,1
I really like spotify and all but i dont really like the smart shuffle in the playlists since it mixes songs that i havent heard that i dont like or just songs i dont like at all and the fact i have to pay just for it to be on the normal shuffle or for it to go in order is just making me feel less motivated to listen to music in spotify but besides the things i said spotify is a good app to listen to songs,1
I would like to thank the team who launch spotify !* Like so so much good app to enjoy the music and podcastes are so amazing!!!!! i love it so much After geting the premium package from spotify i enjoy it more bcoz there is no intruption of ads and it allow to download the music and enjoy it while you are offline thats a good feature and yaa thats it :),1
"Spotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded music and podcasts, including more than 82 million songs, from record labels and media companies.

Good app for music all your favorite on here upgrade if you prefer no ads great app ... Ybisnolungz,1
What is this kind of problem? My Wi-Fi has high-speed network but the song isn't playing. Is this maintenance problem?,0
Ye konsa sa update LA diya ek Dum bear,1
"Love the app but when i put a song on repeat IT DOESNT EVER REPEAT so no i dont love it, infact if this doesn't get fixed im deleting it",0
"I love Spotify! It has easy downloads, and easy to get to widgets. Thank you!",1
Whats the point of this app bc its not to play the music i tell it to.,0
I'm very happy with Spotify library and sound.,1
"Uninstalling. Let me decide what I think is ""misinformation"". Spotify is simply a platform. I don't need to be protected by a software company.",0
Best music app ever. So fine you have to pay for it. But it's the best.,1
"Only giving 2 stars to highlight the issue of advertisements with advertisements on podcast. I pay every month, I should get no advertisements... bit of a joke.",0
Love Spotify! I use it everyday. Weird glitch with my new phone. It stops playing when I turn my phone off and the que window gets stuck sometimes.,0
"6 skips per hour, not playing songs that you click on, adding siggested songs to playlist even if you dont want to, its piece of dog s*#$. The pc verison is so much better.",0
The best music stream app!,1
Love this app. So easy to use. Great for searching for the music you want ðŸ™‚,1
"THE BEST SONG APP EVER SEEN BUT SAD , BECAUSE OF THE ADS",0
Can't use google play money to buy subscription.,0
This is a awesome app I get to hear favorite songs and my calm songs 5 stars for this app,1
"I love this app and i really think the songs are better quality than the songs in resso, gaana, wink, etc...... I really recommended this app to all my frnds and cousins and some of them downloaded it too!! Where some are still addicted to MP3 or RESSO...... This makes playlists for me by my tastes and i get all the songs ima searchin by just typing 1 line from the lyrics... Worth 5 ðŸŒŸ guys pls go ahead and download this app... Thnx spotify!!!!!! ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ",1
Spotify a good app try it All are perfect lovely app Easy to use,1
"Doesn't plays anything at all. Many singer's playlists are just empty. Tried restarting phone, logging out n in.. Not made for android!",0
Its ok but just make it so i can listen to my liked songs its stupod what they try to do to force money out of us these days,1
Great music app. A lot less adverts than some others on free app.,0
"What happed to spotify? Constantly crashing. Stops playing. Cant stop it from playing, forsing me to close the app. Repeats the same content or song over and over. If i select another track, it dose it to that one. Dose it for android and iphone.",0
"Spotify was the best before, but now its ADIFY. Its more ads than song. Atleast 4 ads after each song. This makes it hard to even use spotify on phone without premium. Gave 5 stars before, but had to change it now. Would definitely give 5 stars if the ads could be reduced. The Indian accounts are flooded with ads, you get really frustrated and might even throw your phone. Once an Ad starts it goes on for atleast 4 ads and then the next music. Please do something about this.",0
Don't have all the songs i like but i like it,1
"Ivermectin infused crack head supporting platform. Needs a report lyrics option since sooo many are so very wrong. Some of these lyrics are as clear as day, so how Spotify blindly accepts ones so wrong, I just don't know. Listen over VPN = more ads. Not cool.",0
"Great b/c I pay for it. I hate ads. Howeverrrr, I would like to be able to listen to the song briefing (or whatever it's called lol) when I click 'add songs'. The service is $10 a month. More and more it's starting to feel not worth it with the crashing and lack of ""premium"" service. Please fix this.",0
I've had this for 10 plus years and honestly this is by far the best music app I ever had the pleasure of using,1
"Spotify is nice and all but when ever I try to play a song I want to play it plays another song that is similar to the one I want to hear, I never get to listen to the actual songs I want to listen to and it's kind of annoying",0
There is no music in this app..its full of damn advs,0
"New update broke the app. I can't even access the now playing window, so I'm stuck on shuffle and can't skip songs. I have been a paid subscriber for years, this app became unusable overnight.",0
"Pretty good app. Was thinking about purchasing ad free, but I'm with Neil Young. The ads were mostly Big oil and Facebook trying to convince me they weren't evil.",0
No REPEAT song option. You have to struggle to find the mode to repeat songs. And the app often rebuffs or shut you out. No easy OFFLINE option... but ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN SLAVE OWNER AMAZON.,1
Spotify without premium is very stupid,0
"Nice application,you can play and choose multiple songs for free,especially songs from local artists. That's great.",1
It constantly opens a banner with last song played even though I haven't opened the app in weeks. This is so irritating. I've searched Google for answers turned off anything in administration that looks remotely to stop it and it just keeps popping up. Guess I'll just uninstall it way to pushy Spotify.,0
I love this app so much because i can linsen to the songs i like and i had this app befor but i had to reset or restart my phone because i forgot my password to my phone but i changed it to a earier password.,0
Great experience and enjoying every minute of listening.,1
Great app,1
"Describing My experience with Spotify is NOT optional. As far back as I can remember I used to think to myself, ""why can't all music be free?"" I mean everyone was holding the music hostage, the record stores, the recording companies, the illuminati (probably, I mean those folks are just into everything). Finally, this Mr. Spotify comes along and does the right thing by making the music free. Just a few bucks per month and all the music is free! Way to stick it to the illuminati Mr. Spotify!",1
Good probably but like without paying we can't download songs and if we are traveling especially music lovers it wouldn't come offline,0
For easy listening the app is great for me ..... a techno illiterate gal !,1
I used to love this app it was the best free or you could do the premium at a good price BUT my wife has made several playlists and they no longer just play just the songs on the playlist they.also play the recommended or added songs and she does not like that so why has it changed so much? We were going to do some songs for a picnic we were having it was playing songs we did not want,0
Irritating App with Ads in between at irrelevent timings. Wont recommend..,0
It's in a league of own!!How can it not be great .it's your music.with our interruption,0
I love how they have exactly what you want but there is one thing about the just watch I don't like how you can't delete some of the things but it's fine,1
Lot of ads,0
Great app to just let music play with screen off.,1
The Enhance button disappeared from my liked songs overnight,0
"I've been using Spotify premium for years, its very easy to use and very convenient but these day it started to lagging quiet a lot and took time to open the app which makes me felt kinda frustrated about it. At first I thought it was my internet problem but then other app that required internet connection works perfectly fine. I happened to see other spotify users review, seems like they also face same thing like me. I hope it will be fix soon.",0
Love you,1
I think its better if i can hear my playlist offline without paying anything,0
Works great for the most part. Usually a few times I lose control from my ear buds and have to force close Spotify to get it to work again. Now I get a Bluetooth pop-up that happens every time I launch the app and happens regardless of if I accept or not,0
"Had Spotify for years, but recently when I play a song from an album/playlist, it plays 1 song then goes off playing a completely random song, not from any playlist I have. Will be ditching soon, not worth the hassle.",0
GOOD,1
Bad.... They have internet to show me 50 different ads and they can't even load a 3min long podcast. WoW So kunty,0
Can't have a list of artists (based on saved songs) anymore,0
Spotify web player isn't working properly,0
"I love this app, been using Spotify for 8 yrs, premium ~4 yrs. But every few months the last 2 yrs Spotify sends an update that breaks the app, and it DRIVES ME NUTS! Please send stable updates or add an app changelog, b/c once it's fixed again, I'm just going to stop updating the app. Also everytime I restart my phone, all my downloaded music (~3,000 songs) gets deleted and I get signed out. :( Update: Forced to update b/c it just stopped working, same problems, uhhhh.)",0
Great app. The listening environment is best. On my older phone there were no ads and on my new one there is ad after every song. That sucks the experience of listening but no way i am gonna buy its premium. 'Agar tum deeth ko to hum tumare papa hai',0
Lately after moving to preimum the app is buggy as hell won't load . Tried contacting the support through mail and all they can offer for support is uninstall and clear cached data. It's pathetic to say was on of the best apps now it's shite.,0
No longer connects to kenwood spotify app in my car.. Bluetooth comnects and plays fine but the spotify app is totally broken now.,0
"With premium features, Spotify is one of the greatest music streaming services with the option to download playlists, skip forward endlessly and even listen to podcasts. (Recommend buying it!) But without premium, sure, you can make your own playlist but with the search feature you can't even play the wanted song. I'm not complaining about premium though, it's amazing, but when I have a downloaded playlist, and I don't have WiFi, sometimes the songs still don't wanna start playing.",1
I like the fact that ever song I've looked up was found .,1
Recent update means unable to skip and pause songs. Otherwise good.,1
I like new update.but when I play songs ads disturb me if no ads this app is amazing ðŸ‘Œ,1
It good i just wish you could customize the mood/genera filters on the liked songs. Also the shuffle and play thing i want to click shuffle multiple times not only being able to press it once.,1
"I haven't been able to sign up in the app ever since I installed it. Since then,when I want to log in,it shows network error or can't log inðŸ˜©",0
"Used to be great, but recent updates have destroyed the app. No longer shows I. The notification shade and constantly says I'm offline when I am not. Update April 2022 - can't pause anymore! More money for QA and less for anti vacxers Spotify!",0
Spotify playlist is perfect,1
its honestly great ever since I bought premium,1
"Wow, this is awesome. I get time to enjoy every bit of the music",1
"UI for stopping, next and previous, and play button disappears during music playing.",0
Very fast and responsive. Amazing playlists.,1
I work nights and having music to play for 14 hrs is amazing. ive got a lot of different Playlist and I love it because it's personalized just for me bcus it's music I picked. I just found out I can combine Playlist if I want to! talk about hassle free. they have me for life.,1
The best new music algorithm out there!,1
Ever since the June 2022 update controls no longer work. The only way to pause or stop spotify is to close the app. Media controls indicate no media is playing when audio is playing.,0
"Generally a good experience when using premium, but recently it keeps crashing after a few seconds of playing...",0
Always music any time anywhere love it.,1
A very good sound experience. Has all types of songs in it .Really smooth app. Controls are so good. Ads are a bit too much .Ads can be reduced. Finally a nice app for music,1
Honestly it was a great app until I couldnt continue using the subscription meant for 1 person. I dont know if thats a bug or if your forcing $ from people. But ill check every month probably til i see what the answer is.,0
"Very good playlists,introduced to bands I would never have heard without this app. Thank you.",1
"Use YouTube instead at least you can choose the songs you want and play them in whatever order. For a service directed on only playing music Spotify can't even do it properly, please just use YouTube music.",0
"Please fix this app. It was working just fine before the update. Not it stops playing music and podcasts midstream, and never has the ""currently playing"" window available. No to mention, I have to accept Bluetooth EVERY TIME I open the app.",0
My recently listened to section had disappeared and plus half of my homepage is ads for podcasts that I couldn't care less about even though I've never listened to a podcast on Spotify before. This app keeps getting worse with each new update.,0
"Good Quality of song lyrics, A Recommend App ðŸ‘",1
Nice to listen to music. And you can follow your friends,1
I gat everything i need right on spotify..,0
Amazing cant think my life without it,1
Last update has killed the app. Frequently stopping randomly during songs both online and offline. No song progress/play/pause/skip bar displayed anymore. Please fix ASAP.,0
Spotify is really good and has a lot of cool songs i love Spotify it's my favourite song app,1
"Has been so buggy the passed couple of months I'm thinking of cancelling my subscription. Podcasts keep buffering/pausing the in the middle (no connection issues) - I switched to Google Podcast. Recently regular playlists stop altogether, and the music bar or what's playing is simply gone, so no way to change tracks or anything.",0
Spotify is the best app so far for listening to music. And I really loved it.,1
"Finally! An app that has all my music, and an Uncluttered, Elegant GUI. Well worth a few c3nts a day.",1
Minus 1 star because I can't Sort My Episodes in A/Descending Date order. I want to listen to the oldest episodes without scrolling for days. (4/12/33),0
"My account was hacked days after opening account. Thankfully, I know not to use same passwords, so I know the data breach was on spotify's end and doesn't affect me in other ways. But I received three emails from them just a few hours apart from three different countries as successful logins and Spotify did not see the need to suspend my account first for security. For such a popular app, I'm surprised anyone uses it.",0
Download Spotify. It is very nice app to listen music,1
Suddenly the app will not display controls for starting or stopping songs that are playing and the only way to stop the song is to completely close out the app. Android,0
"First and most, thank you for the opportunity to create this app. It has better my music library, And I have become addicted. Very good app, well arrange. But, create a periodic discount/ coupon / code. Most importantly, do not charge my bank account directly without pre notice, just because you have my details. However, thank you for the gift of music. Love you guys.",1
Lingering issues for the past couple of months now. The app keeps shutting down for no reason & when listening to a Playlist the current song playing no longer shows so I cant skip/replay. Very inconvenient! App was perfectly fine before this.,0
This is the fantastic app that I had seen in my Life this is best for me I love this app nice ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚,1
Love spotify and loved the app until the last update. Been having alot of bugs where I loose some controls over the app with my headset and the controls disappear in the notification bar. Have to close the app and re open it. It makes it quite annoying to use at work. Could be somthing to do with android though. But my buddy with a completely different phone is having identical issues. Will change the review once it's resolved.,0
No words to say best ever app,0
"5 stars as long as they keep Joe Rogan on! I love Neal Young, but he is no longer "" Rocken in the free world "" I got his records if I feel like listening to him.",1
"Just about every song you could want is here. Easy to use, and I really like that Spotify alerts me when my favorite artists have new music.",1
"More bugs - why does it stop mid-song, why is there no play pause and skip option. This is honestly ridiculous. Please rectify as I get frequently fed up with it",0
The app can't download any songs and it doesn't work when I tried to open it so many times. The app is broken,0
Good app. So much music and more. Thank y'all for the app.,1
Plz add downloader in Spotify so we can download and hear because I can't get net and others also so requesting to add downder in Spotify. Giving one star,0
The only thing really bad is the ads there's way to much,0
App has had major bugs recently including a nonexistent lock screen widget and randomly stopping and restarting playback.,0
Excellent music app one of the best,1
Good for podcast,1
Love spotify. Only change I'd have is to be able to reorder my playlists easily. I've added whole albums to my playlist before but don't want them to be all in a row. If there was a way to permanently shuffle the list that would be awesome!!,0
Been working real bad lately. Doesn't show the bar for the current song playing so only way to stop is to close app completely. Songs don't play when my phone locks for some reason. Fix your app or I'll stop paying the 10 dollars a month.,0
"The most recent update has made this app a nuisance to use. If not fixed soon, I'll be switching my family to another service. Bluetooth glitches, music force plays through phone once disconnected from the car, then can stop or change music until the app is force closed. Straight garbage...",0
Why is it keep showing offline when using cellular data but automatically connects when Wifi detected? I tried all ways but still can't rectify this,0
So much adds like I get 6 adds before I start a song and you need premium just play a song itself.,0
"Good platform. The sound is crisp. I have checked over six months and confirm an extensive stock of reggae, highlife and jazz.",1
Its good. One of the Legal free music apps :),1
"Have tried all the other platforms,but Spotify is the best",1
I personally love Spotify because I can either play games and listen to music or I can consentrate on my work while my ipad is off! It's so easy to find basically every song ever! I say everyone that likes music must have this app!!! The ads are like 15 seconds long and they don't interrupt you in the middle of songs.,1
It was wonderful,1
"Love the App. The last update caused a glitch. After I play, say a podcast, and the close the app. When I re-open, the built in player does not come up. The podcast continues where I left off, but I have no way to pause etc, because the player isn't visible. I've uninstalled and re-installed to see if that would fix the ""glitch"", but no luck.To get it back, I need to restart my phone, or do a force stop on the app.Don't know if anyone else is having the same issue? FYI - MY Phone is a Galaxy S10+, fully updated.",0
I am listening Spotify was the best,1
Love it can find some really obscure recordings. I will be upgrading to to premium.,0
This is one the most amazing apps I've ever had but one thing I would like to see change is how many playlists you can pin ðŸ“Œ in your library. Otherwise nothing! Flawless and amazing! 100% recommend.,1
Since i do ay monthly please stop with the offers and adverts. All is good besides.,1
At first it was good but lately everytime I close the app to heve it on in the background and open another app after the song is done playing it stops completely. I've tried to uninstall and reinstall the app but that didn't work. And I even created a new account but that didn't work either.,0
Superb but we have to buy premium to avoid the ads all other things are superb instead of this,0
"Now look, Im not sure if this is a problem for everyone but it is for sure a problem with me. Not sure if it is a new update, but whenever I try to listen to one of my liked songs, It only plays a small part of the song. And whenever I search up the song. I have to shuffle it with ""recommended songs"" that I wont even like. Not only that, but when I shuffled my liked songs, it doesnt allow me to go back to a previous song. Please change this, I at least want to enjoy music in a freedom-ful way",1
I can't search songs i always find playlist,0
I have a galaxy watch for my phone and when I use it for spotify (like skip the song from it) it glitches. For example when I'd press shuffle play it would stay on the song before and it'd shoe that the whole time. Otherwise I honestly love the app.ðŸ˜,0
Love it... been using for years.... super easy along with Shazam to identify new music...,1
Im loving every single feature of the app,1
It really just has every song you want ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,1
"I love the playlist it creates for friends to share music, but it's very very buggy. It was adding random audio book chapters that neither of us had EVER listened to, nor had in our library. I genuinely thought someone had hacked my account and added random things! The offline mode just doesn't work. I have to turn my data on whenever I open the app until I get a podcast/downloaded music playing, then I can turn it off. Now I'm unable to search for anything online or offline ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸",0
"I would give this a 0 star if possible,i used spotify a lot back in the day.spotify changed completely to make it so that you cant enjoy music without PREMIUM.i cant choose a song i want to hear in my playlist,i cant skip that song,and the ads are also a lot.spotify your so bad now.not all of us can afford premium.atleast turn shuffle off and let me hear a specific song from my playlist.please.thats all i want.",0
It's a good app but when I updated it I couldn't get any of my songs and it's annoying because I planned to listen to some music and relax it also keeps adding songs to my playlists even when I don't want them it's getting very stressful as I'm tryna get a certain song and it has played every song but the one I want and the 6 skips only is also annoying,0
Good music app just wish it could get some songs off YouTube,0
"Everything is great I love this app, but to critique it, things would be improved by having a history of songs recently played. Another good feature would be being able to see which liked songs are in your playlists without having to individually go through each song in a lengthy process",1
"After listening 2 songs, like 6 ads appear and it repeats over and over again, Spotify chill with the ads",0
"Great except for the last update. Now it glitches all the time, stops unexpectedly, won't show anything is playing when there is music playing. Before this it was great, but it is getting frustrating since I play music all day at work",0
great selection I like the way I can pick what I like in music and what artists,1
"I dont know why but i cannot play songs what so ever. It always comes up with internet connection failed, but I did a speed test and it was completely fine. I think it may be the most recent update but I don't know",1
"Spotify became my number one music app, as soon as I learned how they stood up for free speech. Neil Young threatened to pull his music off Spotify, if they did not remove Joe Rogan, for what Mr Young claimed as misinformation about the vaccine. We the people are so fed up with this nonsense and suppression of free speech. This is America and it will not stand. Thank you Spotify. I have deleted YouTube music.",0
Too much ads...this is very irritating,0
So interesting ,1
"It's great I haven't tried any other music podcasts apps,",1
Vary good app for song,1
"Constantly comes back from a ad break, jumps to next episode and marks played for last episode. Cant stand the app, only way to listen to podcast i want though.",0
Too many adds. Many times I get about 5 adds right at the startup of the app. Many times the adds are repeated 2-3 times in the same add break. Extremely annoying. The app is coming off now...,0
"Good app,would recommend,but he Spotify connect feature and the UI is a little buggy",0
"why tf i always have to listen ""Teri Chaand Baaliya"" every time in first ad. It's like i had listened it for 1000 times till now.",1
Love it like it then do it bro ,1
I've been using Spotify for about 3+ years now & I love this music app. The only negative thing would be the price you have to pay to be a premium member. Maybe if someone has been a premium member for so many months with Spotify then yall could lower the price for those long term customers. Just a thought. All in all great app & I would recommend to friends & family.,1
Great music and lots of interesting podcasts.,1
I like Spotify a lot. I wish there was an easier way to view all of my downloaded songs.,0
Put shuffle play on ya right it the shame sequence over and over. Waste of money. Over 1500 song downloaded yet the same bloody 100 songs on repeat you can even guess what's next like a cd. If it gets sorted I'd be surprised. There should be a â‚¬3.99 version where you can skip songs and download but listen to a 30 sec ad every hour instead of wasting â‚¬9.99 not worth it when you can't burn songs keep them or even have a proper shuffle play,0
Will randomly decide to start up on it's own. Nice selection of music and great user interface. 8/10,1
Umm... Lately There is Auto Pausing Problem when the screen Locks Hope It Will Fix Soon,0
Spotify ad every 2 songs just make it 5 or 6 songs,0
"Good app for music but the recent updates have made it impossible for me to make playlists without recommended songs taking over, eating will change once I get a fix or answer.",0
"I love that I can find anything I desire in music, podcasts, etc.",1
"Keeps playing ads to ""enjoy the next 30 minutes of ad free music"" then spamming 2 ads between each song",0
In my experience this is a much better music app than Amazon Pandora or sirius Ill be keeping sirius for the car only,1
It's best music app In India,1
"Easy to find good music, old music I used to enjoy, new music I'm finding to love!ðŸ¤©",1
"It's fine just stop GIVING ME FREAKING MOEN ADS! EVERY TIME I LISTEN TO MUSIC, EVERY 5 SECONDS MOEN FREAKING SCREAMS ""tHe wATeR"" AT ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN IM GOING INSANE. GET SOME NEW ADS. Edit: I have premium now I am no longer haunted by Moen",0
"Great....my music, where and when I want it",1
"Realistically Spotify has their own 5-star rating in my book! As a lifelong diehard music fanatic and somebody whose interest in podcasts is on the rise, Im especially grateful Spotify aleays matches my vibe, ANY DAY/ANY TIME.",1
"Fantastic app. Had it for years, only sucks when your broke for a bit you lose playlist but they do keep it until your back on top. Great quality sound.",1
"Tge app is overall very good,but the app pushes you so much to buy premium with adds,and there are no offline listening option without premium and there are many apps that give this feature for free.",1
Major issues with the app not working recently. Music just stops playing and crashes. I can no longer see what I am listening to and unable to change songs.,0
It's a really good app to use if you're a music lover,1
Good free music app but can be hard to use at times,0
Everything is good I mean excellent but the thing is that I am really irritated with chand baliyaan song advertisement means only one song is reapeatedly coming as advertise other songs are also there,0
"Best app for music, but the ads are annoying",0
My liked songs on my premium account keep disappearing. I have to reinstall more than once a week to keep it working. Thumbs down. ðŸ‘Ž,0
"Just a heads up to the devs, my app is freezing. Not showing the little UI widget at the bottom when I select a song. The app won't even open yet it's playing sometimes. Only sometimes on that part. But the freezing is getting out of control.",0
"PREMIUM BUYERS: READ B4 U BUY Guys, the app's awesome. But: 1.There is no way to see all of the songs downloaded to ur phone. U can only see the playlists u've downloaded or partially downloaded. 2.The only way to clear space is to either delete all of ur songs or go playlist by playlist. If a song is on multiple playlists it won't delete. 3.You can't delete individual songs. This review is limited to 500 char. so I'm cut short. And offline mode is broken too. Dev email me for full report.",0
Does not play the full playlist and always ask to pair to bluetooth,0
"Continually make the app worse (forcing auto-play on with Connect, recommending podcasts I don't want to see) and then refusing to acknowledge feedback and completely reasonable suggestions. ðŸ‘ðŸ“‰",0
There are some weird updates to this app that are so annoying. plz change it.like sometime songs cannot play.,0
"Latest update it's really glitchy, play bar is gone from time to time",0
Been using for years to build my music collection,1
"Even though I shut off autoplay, cleared my playlist, and told it to only download over WiFi this stupid app plays a podcast then as autoplays the next one. Even if it's not downloaded. Uninstalled and reset settings and did it again. To only reason I used it for for my favorite podcast the went 'exclusive' with them. On a month they're no longer exclusive. Also to pick that moron Rogan over one of the most talented musicians is a dumb move.",0
Needs to stop blocking my fav songs so often,0
The service doesn't allow listening music using the same account from different devices simultaneously. And it's premium subscription. You pay a lot and get no funtionality.,0
Spotify is the best App for music in my opinion. It's Amazing Just try it and I'm Damm Sure You love It â¤ï¸.,1
"My Spotify will not let me play my ""liked songs"" offline without going to the settings and selecting ""offline mode"" every single time. I've reset the app, cleared cache, storage, signed out, reinstalled the app, tried everything, but it's still having this glitch on my pixel 6 pro. It was working perfectly and now it's annoying. I used a paid version of the app. Any solutions to this would be great Spotify.",0
"Favorite music app love how they have the music I love like Yair Levi, and Shai sol, mark, eliyabu ,leat sabbah so much good music sometimes it's hard to find this music but I love the mixes also thanksðŸ—£ï¸ðŸ¤",1
"I like Spotify and that's my favorite streaming music app! But in my country the interface is different from US, UK, etc. This is discrimination! For those reason I will give two star now, from five stars ðŸŒŸ which I have rated till now. Please make Spotify interface same for all country ðŸ™. Thanks!",0
Superb,1
Such s cool app the only problem is that newly released songs can not be found...,0
Being able to download podcasts and listen when im in the middle of nowhere is a life saver. Spotty wifi's got nothing on spotify ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‰,0
"Just a few suggestions that i am pretty sure are very easy to implement in the app as i am a sorta dev myself too. 1)Show me which song is going to be played next. 2)Add functionality to make playlist groups so that its a bit easy to organize many playlists 3)Add button to shuffle playlist the random play button next to play/pause isn't actually completely random from what i know after all this time, instead i guess maybe it just picks the best songs to play first",0
Spotify: music ðŸŽµ ðŸŽ¶ and podcasts is a good ðŸ‘ ðŸ˜Š ðŸ¡ ðŸ˜‚ song.,1
"Fair price, EXCELLENT Musica range and availability. Extremely functional app re: sharing between people and devices! And the logic of the app gives you want you want and enables you to alter as needed. Used to be a YouTube Music fan, but not at all, anymore. Well done. 02/01/22: issue with my Pixel 4a5G, when the phone sleeps it pauses and sometimes resumes playing, but I usually have to unlock it. Not conducive to power saving, and annoying. Only complaint ðŸ˜",0
It's just free music with some ads occasionally...but u can personalised your own songs also..It's too gd to be true u must be saying..,0
I love this app,1
Please improve the widgets for Spotify ðŸ¥²,1
By far the best musical streaming source app. Highly recommended!,1
"I loved this app up until they made stupid changes to appease Adelle ðŸ™„ðŸ¤¬ Seriously, put the app back to the way it was where I could skip a song I didn't want to hear at the moment! Now, in place of that button it just pauses/restarts the same song ðŸ™„ Almost caused a wreck trying to find out to skip a damn song now!",0
"Every time, on Spotify....",0
I Love it...If I had to make a change it would be to make the recommended songs for you better...Seems to be the songs you already have on a Playlist you've already made...,0
"I'm having issues after switching from ios to android. This apps got a lots of bugs and dark mode issues with MIUI, Xiaomi.",0
Why soo much of ads??? After every 2 songs you get an ad ... Why forcing to buy premium soo much?? Switching to Airtel Wynk now as it is ad free for every airtel user,0
I LOVE SPOTIFY,1
"Well, the app is actually real good, except for the annoying ads after 4-5 minutes. Every time, after two songs play, there comes whole 3 ads, which just completely ruins the mood to enjoy some good music. Everyone cannot afford to have premium, so it's really not pleasing for people without premium to enjoy music here. Ads are okay, but the amount of it...it's really too much. Hope this matter gets looked over, because I believe there are many users facing this same problem.",0
This is the best app I have ever used to listen to music. I recommend it to everyone.,1
Awesome very user friendly ðŸ˜,1
"I've been a premium subscriber for several years, the app takes forever to load lately. I also would love to see an option to show just the content I've downloaded to my phone. I hope to see improvements soon as well as the roll out of CD quality sound.",1
Exceptional music and Ive found some old rare tunes That I never thought Id find on a app like this  totally happy,1
Good App and collection of songs,1
A Spotify button integration in tiktok would be super fire... We can play viral songs right from the tiktok app.!,0
it is really difficult to login and log ou into ur account from different devices,0
"Spotify is not downloading or streaming anything, I already logged in and out of the app, I already uninstalled it and re installed it. Wifi is working perfectly since I can watch videos on YouTube and I could download again spotify. So the problem is spotify and nothing else. Now I can only listen songs and podcast that I already downloaded. I have premium and I have free storage on my phone and I haven't reached the limit of downloads.",0
"A+++Awesome! The Best music app out there in play store! My ""Go-to"" or ""Must Have"" music app for all my devices!",1
I love the variety of music so much. I'm a daily user you could say!,1
"there is ad very loud. delete the ad pls. annoying maxis ad, disaster to speaker",0
"Nice app, easy to navigate around, but one complain in the free mode on it at least let there permission to download as certain number of audio. That is just an observation.",0
U must be grateful  I still gave this 1 star,1
I play one song but the app play another it sucks . Please solve this problem,0
"It's great, if you enjoy pod casts in 15 minute increments then need to restart because it shuts itself off and closes.",0
Latest update is rubbish. No controls on app to pause or play. Major problems with Spotify app in car as well ðŸ¤¨ðŸ˜¡,0
"Constantly stopping, plays over phone calls, unable to resume properly, what is going on here! Spotify, you need to fix these bugs if you are going to charge people 9.99 a month!",0
"Its an amazing app, the only thing I would change is the fact that you only have 6 skips, i get that its a premium feacher but it gets anoying, besides that I love this app!!!",1
Generally great however a repeat of individual tracks would be a welcome addition.,1
"Exceptionally Pleasant. Truly enjoy the service, quality, and the Music Quality. Highest rated music platform on Google Play.",1
"I only use Spotify for podcasts and it is terrible at that. Routinely pauses my podcast, won't let me see the video portion, loses my progress in the podcast. If Spotify didn't have JRE I would never use this terrible app.",0
This aap is very amazing but add come any time,1
For some reason I no longer have the ability to swipe on songs to add them to my que and scroll up for the search bar in my liked songs,0
The ap stops working every ten minutes. I've tried reinstalling and everything is updated on my device.,0
The see more songs button not working on all artist,0
One of the better streaming services.,1
tf I suddenly got logged out from the app and now the app is stuck in the loading screen I can even login again it's just stuck in loading screen I deleted it and re downloaded but the result is same I even bought Spotify premium but the account is gone.,0
Very nice and good quality,1
"Not the worst but quite bad, sometimes one wants to only listen to the things they like, yet sometimes the app will ""recommend"" and will force you to listen to said ""recommendations"" and if you skip them, then it takes up the already limited skips one already have, so that is quite annoying, and also, whenever there is an ad, they will multiply by three so instead of one I have to listen to three ads before going back to my music. So yeah not the worst thing in the world but quite bad",0
Nose complain. Been using Spotify for more than 6 years and it hasn't disappointed me. I just wish the Hifi be done so the music quality can be even better better.,0
I love it has so much music that I like.,1
"I think the app has a bug. I already tried the premium mini for a numerous times because I like to listen to various songs offline. And I can say it is a wonderful experience not until this time. Every time I download songs and go offline it says that there are no downloaded songs. Thus, I have to bear the hassle of reconnecting to an internet connection and carefully not exit the app to redownload the songs. This is because once the app is closed, the downloads would be gone again.",0
Thanks Excellent and very power fully good,1
Perfect companion during long travels.. ðŸ‘ðŸ™‚,1
This is really nice app but their is a problem that the lyrics are not in English in their own language but I like this app so much thank you,1
It's help to ease anxiety...,1
I seen to not be the only one dealing with a nissue with this app. Fix the problem. I have been using the app for a long time and now I am dealing with the issue where it just cut off the music for a few seconds or a few minutes. Fix the problem.,0
It was great...I love old songs...so cool...ðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œ,1
"The update broke the functionality of the app. It randomly stops playing, and it sometimes plays without having the possibility to stop it. The app has become useless.",0
"After the most recent update, songs pause randomly on different Samsung phones, even after troubleshooting power saver mode, and trying with wired headphones and regular phone speakers. Spotify premium family account. PC works normally.",0
Good app,1
"Great app, easy to use, great app to share your music files with others, collaborate folders. Highly recommend",1
Review deleted ðŸ¤¡ The app actively makes the process of using it actively harder. Spotify also likes to propagate misinformation by lending credence to large creators that endanger the lives of others.,0
"Since some recent update, this amazing app now plays songs in my playlist in random order, using shuffle by default. It's EXTREMELY annoying to constantly having to go back to my phone and app to toggle shuffle off after I realize that. I couldn't find any preference either to resolve it. Hope this is fixed soon, will change my rating once it's done. Thanks.",0
"Hi!....My name is Bob, and I have and currently an avid Spotify User! Spotify has always been my absolute favorite music app because, Spotify let's you take control and create, send, storege,transfer,share, download,...etc.... Any more questions? I was born with a musically inclined background, and I give Spotify most of the credit! SINCERELY, Mr. BO BY WINNINHGAM. (MAXX7878).",1
A good variety of songs and oldies!!,1
A complete app for collection if favourite songs,1
"Buttons Can't be click, skip can't be click, getting a wrong password error when the password was entered, can't do anything pretty much broken",0
I am unable play songs it's automatically closing please check and let me know,0
Price gauging at its finest,1
I keep having trouble with the app the last couple of months. The controls quit working and I have to keep reinstalling to get it to work right.,0
Nice music and such. Pretty cool,1
"Constantly crashing lately. No way to pause, slip, or play music as the now playing banner at the bottom is completely missing and the media player in the pull down menu is either missing or not updated from the previous listening session.",0
Way better than those other music/radio apps.,1
App needs to be fixed. Music just stops playing at random times and the play and pause buttons just disappear along with the song that is currently playing. I have to restart my phone to get it to work again briefly. Please fix,0
"I CAN'T SEEM TO GET AUDIO BUT I ALSO DON'T KNOW WHAT TO PUSH TO MAKE IT ""PLAY"" MUSIC.. HELP",0
It worked fine before but for whatever reason now it stops the music by itself or just completely crashes,0
"I LOVE SPOTIFY.. In my opinion Spotify is the BEST music app out there, change my mind. YOU CAN'T!!!",1
Its nice,1
Whenever I pick a song it will always play a completely different song.. Think I'll stick with YouTube ðŸ–•,0
l Acknowledge your good the good job on social media...... and keep it up,1
"Spotify is an excellent app, but payment is difficult in my region ðŸ¥º. A lot of us in Nigeria can't pay for subscription because it doesn't accept our cards. Helppppp! I'm gonna cry if I lose my music.",0
The best music experience you can ever have...,1
"4 stars due to a bug in the app where if I've listened to podcasts, the playback notification will stack up with old podcasts I've listened to and refuse to be removed.",0
I love Spotify so I pay the premium plan. But I'm having the same problem some people reported: missing music controls in the app screen. I'll update the app and check if this problem is solved.. In using Android 12 in a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE device.,0
"Tons of music, and great streaming choice",1
Love it,1
This app is not opening instead of i have lot of data,0
"Whats with the shuffle thing and why is that my only option to play the song in the album????? Let me listen to stuff I like and not wait for it to come up in the shuffle???? Like what the hell, I don't want to listen to stuff I don't like just so that I can find the one I personally like, it's such a stupid feature and also why the hell can't I choose a song to play in an album why the heck do I have to put it on shuffle??? It's so hard to work with honestly, and it's such a stupid update",0
I love everything about this music app. I have fallen in love and will neva enjoy another music app like I do Spotfi.,1
Premium ,1
"Really good app, new to it , with no prob.",1
Amazing there music is everything your want and it's no charge of pay ðŸ™‚,1
Expensive! Not even competitive Â£10 / month,0
Spotify has become the main app I listen to music on. Never had a problem. Love the great choice of music and that I can create playlists.,1
Unable to sign in on my s22 ultra. It's a shame as I kept trying for 2 days and still couldn't sign up or sign in,0
Always recommended but you always need a strong internet to play songs .,1
"Ads ads ads, everywhere everytime. It even change your Playlist and plays the advertised song like 'chaand baliyan' every here and then. For God sake, try to understand, it can be your favorite song but not every other person's.",0
"What's the deal here? Compared to the desktop version, this is inferior to it! Why is the ability to play any songs so bare or if not, barely free? Is there more that need to be said about this? I think I made my point clear enough!",0
Spotify is a new app for me and navigating all it has to offer is like a new day every time.,0
"It could have a ""shuffle all"" button",0
"Good app, local file thing is a bit weird to use since sometimes it doesn't save the files, but it works for the most part.",1
Useless. Only keep ask paying for membership. If only want paid users advertise as paid app. Not as free app. Ridiculous app sure.,0
Excellent way to listen on the road. Generally works well with Android Auto.,1
Best music every time,1
"This gets me through the day, tough or good day. Spotify got my back",1
"Barely ever works on home computer. Songs play for minutes with no sound. I spend more time trying to play music then listen to music. Phone app works good, but don't always want to use phone app. I think I'll be dropping Spotify for Apple Music or Amazon Music.",0
It's good but the add is so annoying....,0
I've been using spotify for years and overall it's okay I just don't like that after every 2 or 3 songs there's an add.,0
"It's a good app to listen music with but I can't find ""The house of the rising sun"" from Wolfenstein young blood.",0
Whenever I used this app all I got were blatant lies by pseudo-intellectual podcasters. Also recieved better music selection on other music streaming services. There are plenty of options out there. No need to use the one that prefers to promote outright lies and not pay artists.,0
"My favourite app but thing I miss the most is having details about why the artist wrote the song, song meaning, facts about the artist etc, lyrics are great feature but would prefer to choose what I want. Had this app for nearly 10 years in premium and I love it but that change is why I gave it 3 stars and not 5",0
In the new update i am not able to add songs to the queue.,0
This is the best music app,1
"Look maybe If I give a 3 starðŸŒŸ review instead of a 1 you'll fix this app so I can listen to my favourite artists again, like come on you want me to pay for an upgrade when the free stuff don't work?",0
Enjoying the user friendly app And gret music,1
"Absolutely excellent,I love it. It's j my acception.",1
"""Enchanted Waterfall"" by Tory Lanez is unplayable and this is me being petty. That 5 star rating I initially gave will come back as soon as this ""technical issue"" is fixed!!",0
"The app is epic. I don't mind the ads. I just need one thing added and I'd give a 5 start rating no doubt. A personalisation option to change the background in the profile to any default color options like blue, purple, green etc, instead of the default ones, which most of the time don't match with many users' profile pictures. Please try to add this feature",0
It finds your type of music ðŸŽ¶ or suggests something in your taste of music it delivers!!,1
Bro this update is each I can't unshuffle do we even need sufffle,0
"Every single time I use spotify (which is every day) It glitches one way or another. Switches to something different in the middle of a podcast episode, gets stuck on loading screen until i restart the app a couple times, says I have no internet connection when I do, etc. I am so tired of paying for this service when it is consistently terrible and never seems to improve. I'm going to have to find a different music platform if it stays this way much longer.",0
"I personally love this app! The UI is good and the app itself look kinda cute. The music quality is really good. The best part is that it gives my daily mood mixes and weekly mixes too which is very accurate to the kinds of songs I listen. The discover features isn't for discovering random songs but of genres/styles you prefer. The reason to give 4 star is because of too many annoying ads. You can at least remove ads in certain playlists like ""meditation"" or ""study"" Overall it's pretty good!",1
Too many adds,0
i love it and you have like all the song,1
"Removal of of the ""Scan to invite"" feature for group sessions. One of the absolute best features of Spotify. The new Group session is clunky and nobody I know has even bothered trying to get it to work, because it doesn't.",0
Everything I could ask for in a music app and more! I love it! Thank you.,1
"Used to be amazing. A recent update has caused issues where it stutters and removes the player controls. This requires a restart for the app to fix. I loveSpotify, but I need this to be fixed.",0
"I had Spotify for a few weeks and I had a whole bunch of liked songs, and all of the sudden, all my songs are just snippets of my songs that I've favorited. And I know it's because I ran out of my premium trial. And when you don't have premium, you're limited to SO LITTLE STUFF you get SO many ads and you can listen to your favorite song. And you only get 6 skips and hour?! That's so dumb and stupid. Change spotify. I might as well listen to my music on YouTube. And that's what I'll do. So dumb.",0
The last week or so it's been buggy as all get out. The pause and skip function freezes up and has to be force closed and then I have a constant notification of spotify is trying to play. Pretty frustrating for a paid for app.,0
"Be using for years, always super easy to navigate and organize playlists. Highly recommend, use mostly because I can organize my specific music taste unlike other music players.",1
"Let me list all the negatives: - Too many repeat songs - You can't skip more than 6 songs an hour even if they're repeats - Too many ads and you can't skip them. - You can't rewind songs. - There's only shuffle play. If you just wanna listen to one album, you're out of luck.",0
"The app is decent for listening to music, but I wish on the free music, you could have six skips and six rewinds. Also, when you hide songs once, you cannot unhide them, which is very frustrating.",0
It's very easy to use and nice music listening application.It recommends me nice music as per my interest.It is a very nice platform.,1
If only all the songs I downloaded could appear on a single page,0
"This app doesn't seem to like other apps, so frequently while the podcasts still play, I can't control the playback or forward. I end up having to restart or reinstall.",0
If they had a Spotify make this be the best app that makes it push the haters back in their seat keep doing great and be yourself they will hate but you will be you in the end,1
There is not any option to clear recently played history. Overall is better,0
This is so horrible it puts on a random song every time I try to put the song I want to listen to,0
The all song are awesome of spotify,1
Honestly great experience. I tried the free premium plan for 3 months and when I was done bruuuuh I needed more premium and it's been great ever since ðŸ˜Œ,1
The app is having all the songs and I love that most of them have lyrics whereas the other music app I used had no lyrics for kodt of the songs. Totally an outstanding app from my view,1
"There is no reason to pay for this if you have yt premium. Here you have less content and it costs the same. Bad design, hard to use, bad recommandations. Cannot say anything positive",0
It has annoying suggestions besides a few good ones but the stupidest thing I realized was that I can't download just one song only lists..,0
I've been on board with Spotify since it was crazy to pay for a music sub. Solid platform. Smooth customisable playing. All the songs and podcasts. Worth every cent,1
Its good but whenever I try to listen to an individual songs it takes me to other songs I dont care about,0
"Pretty good selection of music, and user friendly interface. But when I remove things from a queue and just let it play for any longer than an hour, and not always that long, it completely reshuffles the queue and it's infuriating",0
Whenever you want to listen to an album it starts inserting a bunch of random songs for no reason like if I wanted to listen to them I would have put them on and its probably cut I don't have premium but why like what's the point or reason it's just an inconvenience and why do I have to watch 70 ads every few songs,0
I wouldn't normally use an app that plays constant advertisements interrupted by the occasional song but I have this app installed so that I can watch Joe Rogan's show. Without this show the app would be totally redundant and would never see the light of day on my phone.,0
Nyc app I really just wish we could be able to download a couple of songs on the free bundle for those of us who can't afford paid,0
One if the best music apps ever they have everything you want,1
"Im just trying to listen to the music i want. I dont want to listen to some other songs i dont like. I had to watch tutorials on youtube ""How to listen liked songs on spotify""",0
"Pretty good, large library, app can be a little glitchy. Edit- Changed to two star. Glitches are getting worse. I have to close and reopen the app multiple times a day. Adds are apparently allowed in podcasts because my premium subscription only covers add free music. Downloaded music is only accessible with internet. Why have a download feature that requires internet to access, that defeats the purpose of downloading it. I miss google music :(",0
"It is really good app.. actually it is best.... Whatever I want to listen , any music I wanna listen always , I go on Spotify.... thank you for making Such a brilliant app..ðŸ™‚",1
Great app & you're not pressured to pay. I can put up with a few commercials for this great music you pick yourself!!!,1
"Except for the ads which are childish, best music app",0
If this app isn't reopened every time after I pause it the songs are glitchy and pause themselves. If I go to the app I can't even see if it is playing a song. No skip and no song shown playing. Fr if it's not one thing it's the next.,0
"you have to pay for premium for basically everything, which is ironic considering how spotify doesn't pay its artists",0
The app just keeps getting better. I love that I can download songs and they continue to strive to attain the rights to all my favorite songs. They even have Decode by Paramore now!! My favorite thing lately is being able to sing along as I read the lyrics in the app!,1
Just started using Spotify. My Son has been using it for about a year. I am really enjoying the app,1
Very bad app within 2 songs they presenting advertisement. Comparatively Jio Saavn is better atleast in that app we could listen nearly 10 songs without any advertisements and no subscription ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡.. Also how Spotify can think that we should pay money on these subscriptions to listen without advertisements. Please remove ads.......,0
"Very easy to use for me, high quality, Spotify Premium is a great deal that I enjoy using every day. Recommend to anyone using their phone to hear music on a daily basis.",1
Normally Spotify is amazing I have premium but last few weeks I dont even get a minute into a song before the app stop playing it tried staying on the app looking for updates changing songs and playlists and it doesn't change it just keep stopping not been very happy with it lately after all im paying for the service,0
"Love it, just wished there was a notification widget to pause the music on the lock screen. (Update 4,12,22) the app is growing in its malfunction. The option to pause music in the app is not there, even when I disconnect Bluetooth it won't stop the music. Now I have to restart the phone just stop the music. Starting to hate it, I'll see about moving to another app",0
"Really love all the great podcasts, the video feature is really nice as well.",1
Iam giving 3 star for this app but i liked the futures of this app its really awesome app for listing song I used listen kpop and pop songs regularly but why i have gave 3 star because iam not getting lyrics in some songs please fix that bugs in this app i request you Spotify please make it right,1
From my experience with music apps this is definitely the clear winner! Keep up the good work guys. John x,1
"Buggy since last Update, asks me every day if bluetooth usage is fine. Does not show up which track it's playing until restart, sometimes I even have to restart the phone to fix the problems. It's also cutting out when using Bluetooth, which makes the experience unbearable. Same here again, problems stop when restarting the app, sometimes they don't and I have to restart the phone. Please fix this, it's awful.",0
It was good in the first but now when I play my playlist it recommend me songs yet I can't play the songs in my playlist and just show a part of it,1
This app sucks. I have no control on stopping or starting. Doesn't work with headphones,0
I wish I could listen to music without the internet... it doesn't give a lot of hints either when your looking for new artists or songs. But it's super quick in finding exactly the song I'm looking for. A plus.,1
I am in love with Spotify sound track ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜.Easy to use .love you @spotify,1
I love spotify I've been using it for something around 3-4 years and have personally not really had any problems and I use this app almost everyday it's easy to use you can find some really good artists and songs just by listening to your discover weekly which recommends you songs based off what you have been listening to,1
"I like the app,I like the different selections, just Improve the sound quality some days you can really hear the distortion ***Takes too long to load up.*** when it takes more than 5 minutes that's not good. Have to turn it off and on off and on.",0
I love this when I'm in a mood I have a Playlist that calms me down I turn that on and fall in love and relax/chill,1
The best music library,1
Just perfect.But ads where residuals and they can be removed by,0
The app is nice but it would be worth all 10 stars if you added the option of downloading single songs instead of whole playlists. Just a friendly suggestionðŸ˜Š,1
great music selection and streaming quallity,1
"Thank you for fixing the button order, that's the way it should be :)",1
"Spotify is great, but for some odd reason, i always get an ad when ever i play one song, it seems like after i play one song, and ad appears everytime. Please fix this issue",0
"Currently, I have to force lose app every time I use to press play. New fancy floating now playing bar at the bottom always disappears. S20+",0
"Everything I need to feel good music, podcast, and stories. Thank you Spotify.",1
"Spotify has introduced me to a whole new world of music!! Love it!!! NEW REVIEW...HOWEVER...I've been extremely disappointed lately because no matter what I do, I suddenly cannot preview songs. Spotify was No help whatsoever. I'm a Premium member and am very discouraged. Looking at other options now.",0
This app is really good ðŸ˜Š because you can even turn off the phone while playing it and doesn't give me any problem or errors it give us a very good ðŸ˜Š service ðŸ’¯âœ¨ðŸ¤,1
"The update ruined it. Now music plays without showing up, so you can't hit pause, and the only way to get it to show is to restart the whole app",0
"Used to love this service but for the last two weeks, it has been absoluty been broken. It crashes non-stop, the music will skip, I have to keep uninstalling to get to work for a day before it starts all over.",0
"Actually i hate it,when i playing my favorite song like pano,it turns to ilysb and i really hate it so muchh,but the songs are good you can play it in every where i hope you fixed it ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜Š",1
This aap is so cool i find any song on this ðŸ‘,1
Keeps on playing suggested songs instead of the songs we chose,0
"The last update has so many issues... the navigation bar will disappear, meaning the only way to stop a song (or do anything) is to kill the app. Everyone in the family has the same issue, so this is clearly a new bug",0
"Amazing access to music, spotty service for an app with high price & so much market dominance and it severely underpays artists. Prompted me to rate it immediately after glitching.",0
Switched over from Google play music after YouTube got involved with that app. Now that I'm on spotify couldn't imagine using anything else. Price is great. Has all my music and podcasts. Can't ask for more out of an application.,1
Spotify is a great music app I don't mind paying the premium price it's worth the money and I like layout out if the app aswell its worth getting better then apple music,1
No longer works in my car. And yes it's this app. Pandora works just fine.,1
Fantastic app it has all the music you want.,1
Always plays repeatitive songs...it seems Spotify don't wants to put effort in playing new songs..and because of this I hate some of the most beautiful songs due to repeated play,0
"Recently it's become just awful. Too glitchy, sends me podcast recommendations that I don't even watch, the volume becomes high then low then high again randomly without me doing anything, it's just an overall horrible experience",0
"Come on Spotify! The 'currently playing ' bar comes and goes meaning no control over next, play and pause, the widget only works when it feels like it and car control comes and goes. Disappointing!",0
Great selections and playlists,1
great excellent,1
Music stops playing mid-song. Fix this please. I pay money for this app.,0
App doesn't allow you to remove it from the notifications and when you select a song...( Bob Marley three little birds.) It plays a completely different song..,0
Mind blowing,1
"Used to be my go to music app. Since an update, I believe, on the free version, there are more ads more frequently, after every other song. Also use up skips trying to get to the song picked, and premium is far too expensive. Unhappy.",0
There is a bug where the current song playing doesn't show. The song bar is also not showing up. The current song playing also pauses multiple times while playing. There are no updates showing up.,0
"Newest update broke the app. Songs constantly pausing for no reason, loss of functionality, slow loading, and constant crashes. Fix it now or everyone's gonna start to leave",0
Overall good ,1
I'm having the same problem that many other reviews are referring to. Music and podcasts are pausing and playing when they feel like it. The controls don't always show up. Spotify was good for years but for whatever reason it has degraded it a near unusable state. I will be switching to a different service if this isn't fixed soon.,0
"I generally like the app and love cross platform integration (mobile, desktop, web). One of the best music streaming app available on Android devices. What I don't like though, is the dashboard with suggestions that disappear. If I have some suggestion container with a few cards in it, as soon as I pick one card, the entire container disappears and I can't check the other suggestions. That really drives me crazy, especially when there are a few interesting picks there I'm unable to open.",0
"No problems, everything works fine, great Twitter Support.",1
Pretty good but the free service slowly gets worse and worse over time,0
"Ive had spotify for over 5 years...these recent updates are just STUPID!!! Cant skip songs, cant even pause songs or repeat songs. And because there's no pause button,I have to restart my phone just to get the music to stop!!!!At this point im debating keeping membership...seriously",0
My favorite music app. Hands down. I don't deal with ANY issues. Ever. Well other than all the spanish ads when I don't speak the language but that's manageable. Totally recommend,1
"I loveeee this app but recently I've been experiencing issues with the app such as it crashing randomly or sometimes the app freezes while the music still plays, so for example Song B is playing but the information shown is that of Song A. And some of these bugs sometimes fix when I close the app and restart. It's also hard/impossible to transfer uploaded songs that are on my computer to the phone app when trying to download the playlist it's in. I've been a customer for years please fix!",0
One of the best application in my smartphone,1
Love this app! I've listened to so much music I've never heard before!,1
"Great selection, no hassle easy navigation.",0
"Awful recently, not sure what has happened but in the last 7 days the number of times streaming pauses has become impossible and difficult to use the app. Restarted, cache cleaned, phone upgraded, nothing help",0
App. Doesn't operate correctly. Alot of the time.,0
I cant play the music i want because it is on shuffling and i had to re-download it and it is still doing the same thing. And now i dont know what to do,0
Love the app and have been using it for years but why does it take up so much space?,0
1 star because developers refuse to fix the bluetooth autoplay feature. If the app is closed NOTHING should play... EVER! It doesn't matter If it is connected to Bluetooth or not. Amazon Music doesn't do this. Pandora doesn't do this. Only Spotify doest this. Why is that? Are your developers graduates of community college? Or maybe not graduates at all?,0
Enjoy using this app to listen to pod casts and music.,1
Songs and albums keeps being removed ðŸ˜‘and some music ain't available in here yet.,0
Good,1
"Switched from Pandora a few years ago, Spotify continues to get even better. Nice!",1
One of the most beautiful song application another apps,1
"I tried to listen to anything, let alone just search in the search box, but it constantly said I had no internet connection available, even when connecting to the Wi-Fi, I even turned off mobile data to see if that helped. I couldn't even use the app.",0
"Absolutely representing for the 2% black male teachers everywhere. Looking forward to the next episodes on the podcast. Teaching is tough, it can be harder when there are not enough that represent the students they teach daily.",0
"I spent most of the time in your app, my day start and stop with this... I love itðŸ’œðŸ’œ",1
"If you're gonna make me pay for no ads, at least make your app function with errors.",0
"Kind of late but thank you for making it available in my country!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So far so good, other than the annoying adds tho they're kinda rare but if I wasn't broke I'd pay 4 premium ðŸ˜©ðŸ’¯",1
Thank you. For Spotify app i like the all song thank you,1
There should be an option for play next and it would also be nice if the theme could be customised,0
Great music streaming service. My go-to service for playing music. Good selection of international music.,1
"Spotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded music and podcasts, including more than 82 million songs, from record labels and media companies. As a freemium service, basic features are free with advertisements and limited control, while additional features, such as offline listening and commercial-free listening, are offered via paid subscriptions. Spotify is currently available in 180+ countries, as of October 2021. Users can search for music based on artist, album, or genre",0
Great app great access to music but I wish you could listen to songs without wifi without getting premium.,0
I like all the variety of music you have on here however when I make a playlist and I usually have about 40 or 50 songs on there it keeps playing the same 5 or 10 songs over and over again without playing the other songs that are on my playlist that really sucks it's no different than listening to the radio the idea was so I wouldn't have to listen to the same songs over and over again but this app plays the same music over and over again without playing every song in your playlist pointless,0
"Love it, great selection of songs easy to use and has accurate lyrics for most tracks too",1
"Premium user here, used to love Spotify but now thinking about cancelling and just using a different service. App has been broken for a while now, keep having to force close it. Music will randomly stop for a couple seconds and start again without any reason. It often won't display what is actually playing but will be stuck on what I listened to the last time I used the app, then I have to force close and open up again.",0
I would like to give a 5 star but i won't imagine playing another song and the you get another thing just got me annoying,0
"Love the car feature, integrates well. Fast forward is a plus too",1
"Memories and happiness in one basket, thank you",1
It's ok but on mine I don't know if this happens to any one else but it pauses then like 5 minutes later starts playing again but other than uan that pretty good,1
"Works for the most part, but often doesn't update podcasts or claims offline when connected to the internet. Update 4/11/2022: somehow it works even less now. After this last ""update"" now in the middle of podcasts it just randomly stops.",0
"1st. Skip 6 songs per hour, More Like Skip Me Every Day 2nd. Can't go back to a song, BORING 3rd. Can't rewind or forward, I'm now forwarding to delect this app 4th. Unskipable ads, note Exit And Close If ads show up 5th. They say it's free but it costs 59,99 per month, I'm am not paying that amount",0
Still issues way to many adds premium has issues not worth it,0
And everytime i listen to the song it plays then it stops,0
"This App Is So Nice, Handy To Use. All type songs are In One App... Go For it n njoy",1
"Since like a month now the android app has stopped working, always stops at the end of a song doesn't go onto the next or just pauses mid song, super annoying. Sort it out.",0
"Everything works great except crossfade, which sometimes ""turns off"" and then I have to go turn it back on manually.",0
I really love this app because all of the songs I want is in their.,1
This app has great music but wants money so bad. If you like to listen to specific songs like me this app isn't for you because spotify gives you 6 skips every hour and 90% of the playlists make you shuffle so you can't listen to a specific song that you want to so if you want to listen a specific sony you have to buy premium. This app is just so greedy for money but the music is good.,0
Nobody is doing it better than Spotify. No-damn-body! Ya heard?,0
"Endless Music is great, has all the music I like as well which is difficult.",0
"Easy to use and best of all, they support Joe Rogan which is why I bought the premium package",1
I get to listen to all my favorite bands it's amazing I love it and awesome ðŸ˜Ž too I'm a fan of bands so yeah!,1
This app I good but if I want to play my favorite song Spotify will play random song I hate it,0
"This new update is the worst! Everytime i try to play a song its just in the reccomended and i only get a short clip of it. To Only Have to wait so much time to just shuffle it to the song i want, unlike the old interface... Not everything would be a type of playlist! if you spotify creators want me to put a 5 star on here. I Highly request you give to us our old interface back,so that we can all listen to our favorite songs. Peacefully",0
Easy to use. Love this so much!,1
"The app may have a large library but it lacks the basic feature of a search engine. When I search for an artist why doesn't the app provides a sort method based on views or like counts. When you open an artist page you can only see their top 5 songs, top 4 popular releases but complete discography which is totally useless in my opinion. What's the point of showing all songs of an artist when all I want is to hear their best hits then maybe I will give their other songs a try.",0
Widget always disables after calls and have to open app again to play music.,0
"Easy to use,nice user interface",1
Good ,1
Songs in playlists I downloaded keep deleting day by day and I'll have to keep downloading it. What's the point of the premium account thenðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸,0
"Too much ad,can't play back my favorite songs over again",0
"The playlist will suddenly stop playing and have to start all over again. The app sometimes plays over my music player where most of the time it overrides it. Also randomly it won't show playback, to stop the song I have to close the app completely.",0
Too much advertisements.,0
Spotify is good I just wish there was not so many ads and you do not need premium for everything like being able to pick what song you listen to because everything is on shuffle or you can not rewind songs and you only get 6 skips per hour,1
This is a good app but there's just 1 problem whenever i play some music a few minutes it suddenly turned off again and again.,0
Offline mode no longer working in latest update.,0
best music app on the store,1
Love the sound quality and that I can make my own playlist from it,1
Awesome Always playing this over any station on my Alexa,1
This music app use to be better. The random song play function plays the same songs over and over. Bring the old Spotify back!!,0
Luv spotfy.luv alot Romantic slow music. That Spotify. Luv u ever made Spotify. B safe.,0
it's great my only complaint is that I want the audio to be able to be set to a higher settings for quality,0
I like the app it's just annoying how ads all ways come it it won't let me choose the sond I'm trying to play its plays something I do t want to listen to,0
Love the accessibility to all music,1
Very good music service but if you dont have the premium version the ads get very annoying and the 6 skips per hour is not really enough.,0
I only just downloaded Spotify because my 9 year old daughter wanted to listen to music. Well haven't I been missing out. I now use it everyday and i love it,1
"It happened a couple of time that i got logged out and couldn't login, and had to reinstall the app loosing all my downloads in the time of need. Other than that it's fabulous for the price",0
Mood fresh ho jata,1
"Have been trying to subscribe for the premium for like 2 days now, all I keep getting is failed transaction. There should be other better and easy way to subscribe please.",0
Just switched from YT music...I'm one very happy and satisfied customer ðŸ˜Š,1
"I give Spotify 4 not 5 stars, because the company keeps mixing my song and this is anoying, 'cause I have only six scips and for me this is not enough. After all Spotify is great app I recommend!",0
This is a good app . But can't download songs ðŸ‘ï¸,0
"The shuffle button isn't on all Playlist. Music stops after 10 secs even after going into the app. Also, I thought if I had the premium duo plan then it would get rid of ads. Why do ads still come up on podcast?? UPDAT: we are now in a July and it's still happening.. remind me why I pay for this sub???? First review was from back in April 2022. Maybe if the music wouldn't keep stopping randomly it would make more sense.",0
Love listening to all new and old tunes.,1
Great app for music. Love the design and layout. Highly recommend!,1
The app keeps crashing in background mode! It's so frustrating when you are trying to listen to some music and it stops midway and you have to go through the phone again to restart it!!,0
Latest update my made it worse somehow. The app is just unresponsive half the time.,0
"Amazing program! Good that it dosen't turn off after you turn off you're phone (unlike YouTube Music), and A LOT of songs! Recommended! ðŸ˜ðŸ‘",1
I have used the web player and it's very good so at first choice I will support spotify for amazing songs and features which are not available at GAANA,1
"I cant seem to access spotify originals, I don't know wether i need a subscription or there is another problem hope can get back from the app.",0
My spotify premium account says i have to renew even if it's just 15 days passed. How is this possible? I paid php 185 for a family plan and yet it expired right after 15 days of usage. Can someone fix this? Is this just a bug? I already updated the app and it still says i have to renew again.,0
I enjoy the old school music from the 60 and 70 r&b jazz thank you,1
"Since the newest Update, the App is full of Bugs. I Need to restart the App at every Single use.",0
Here I am again. I've got a lot of songs on my list but you see the need to play ten over and over again. Get rid of your suggested songs because Im not impressed with your suggestions.Not impressed with the suggested songs as it's nothing like my song lists.,0
"Doesn't show the current songs playing anymore, takes forever to load if using mobile data. I need to add a song to my playlist first in order to play it.",0
"The last update on my phone took away spotify for me, the update was a couple of days ago, nothing will load or play. I'm on a Samsung a20. I feel lost without my Playlist & or music in general. Can't move to the beat, if there's no beat. Plz fix or I'll stop paying for a service I can't use. Simple, no play, no pay",0
"Spotify is great. I must say, the best music app I've ever loaded. Only thing I don't like is being unable to transfer my premium membership if original device is lost or stolen.",1
It's a little annoying that I'm paying $10 a month but there are still songs that are blocked,0
"Sometimes spotify gives me two songs with four ads but sometimes its nice to me, giving me a 30min ad free period, and when it does, it makes me happy, it honestly does deserve a 5 star rating, its led me to so many great songs and so many good playlists.",1
"Hi, I cannot login to my app from the mobile phone. It tells me to enter the password but nothing happens other than a constant loader appearing on screen, inspite of entering the correct password. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app too",0
"Easy to use & a there's wide variety to choose from, choose from music to wallpapers, to podcasts. Premium is also the best way to go. Download what ya like & ya can play it when off line. No Ads!! Skip forward or backwards on the songs you play. They suggest play lists or make your own. You can connect with friends & share what you're listening to.",1
Pathetic. The app stops functioning even after repeated reinstalling and also doesnt show playlists now.,0
The update I really hate like it won't let listen the song want it :/,0
Very much good,1
"Weak. Poor on every level. Awful playlists. Not user friendly at all. Simple functions don't work but they've felt the need to add ridiculous features that no-one even knows exist. Get the basics right. Glitches, every single time, s22 no other apps on WiFi. Never just opened the app and had it work, generally takes longer than loading a cd to even get the app open, then the music genius algorithm is the worst thing ever, my daily mix lol, no thanks. There must be a better alternative",0
"I am a College student. But when I try to buy the premium for students, I wasnâ€™t able to find my college name. I required to SheerID to Add my college name many time but it still same as before. I can't afford regular premium pack. Thats why Its no use for me.",0
It has good quality downloads but I hate that it adds songs to playlist s and if I want to listen to one it will only give me the preview it is so annoying is this like a setting or something cuz it's better to just Google song now,0
Very good app you can find any song of your choice,1
Great selection of music in easy access.,1
It's pretty good app for songs or playlist I really enjoy it,1
I hate it now that you updated it in a negative way now I can't even play any song I want to cause it only allows me to play with premium or I'll have to wait 6hours to play another song So plz can you just put it back to normal To wher you can play as many song as you want.,0
"When I open the app to play something , The app always gives me a message saying no internet connection available .. though my internet is always on ..",0
"I Really like this app! It's very Helpful when I can find songs on YouTube, and I like that I can Hear my music for 30 minutes with no adds. There are no bugs with it. After all I really like it, I hope this could help some people out there!",1
"0 Stars , Need to open and close app just to pause or skip music . Media player controls keep disappearing in app and not syncing with the notification bar control.",0
"Hey, a small suggestion - Add a new feature in which we can reorder or rearrange our playlist. Thank you.",1
Its giving vibes,1
Perfect if you want to listen to a song but it gives you another.,1
Solid music app Recommend for any music lover,1
It won't work and when I try to listen to music none of my playlists show ive tried restarting my tablet and it wouldnt work uninstalled and reinstalled 4 times didn't work and I updated it didn't work,0
"The swipe to shuffle has been added, now its time to actually give us the swipe down to close the now playing screen. Lifting the finger to press the arrow at the top left can be tiring.",0
"Go Spotify!! Don't let those Orwellian losers bully you into censoring the content you provide on your network! I really respect y'all for sticking to your guns and continuing to be a platform for all voices, not just those that certain people deem ""appropriate."" Also the app has greatly improved after going through a pretty big rough patch and I really appreciate the effort y'all put in for usability. My only quip is that Discover Weekly often has songs and artists I already listen to!! ðŸ˜†",1
Great app use it all the time never any ads,1
Usually works well...but recently it keeps stopping mid-song. Gets annoying after the 3rd time in an hour,0
"This use to be my favorite app, but ever since November 2021 it has completely stopped working on my phone. The app works on other devices, but not my new phone. It's to the point that I've canceled my premium account because the app does not function AT ALL.",0
"Amazing app, would be a 5 but it randomly pauses and unpauses multiple times after around 15 minutes of playing music",0
Always on time! Very consistent product!,1
So nice but if you can just make it easier to search the songs thanksðŸ˜,1
Great choices of Music and Podcasts! The playlist they make for you is awesome. Pick one and go!,1
When I serch no tears left to cry by Ari The song plays f In as if it's ur last by blackpink to many ads only 6 skips per hour and I think u need premium for evrything,0
This app best from all music apps excellent app forever,1
I can listen to endless music with the premium and enjoy not hearing the ad interruptions. I find most songs I want to hear and even find different versions of them that I have not heard before. It helps me with music in the background for my Christian dance and yoga ministry. Praise God!,1
Nice app but ads is problem,0
because of the ad. Ad is so long,0
The app freezes often and will stick in the background constantly playing. I have un-installed the app and reinstalled several times.,0
Sound quality is very good ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,1
It's a good app I been using it for a few years I can enjoy everything on this app keep up the good work,1
Are you kidding me Spotify? This new update is horrible. What makes you think automatically shuffling our playlists is a good update. I want to listen to the songs in order. Why does it only show a few songs in a playlist and you have to click on it to see the entire playlist? Why can't I go back and listen to the previous song? These updates are not only useless but limiting us from properly listening to music. The purpose of a playlist is for US to add songs we WANT to listen to. Not the app!,0
"1 star because you can not just drop advertisement after every single song ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ are we streaming song or Spotify making us watch advertisement... According to me, Spotify should pay us for watching these advertisement ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",0
Nice experience ,1
after the recent update it's not working anymore. there's a bug in the update. please fix it.,0
I want shuffle button for free user or make this app non free user anymore,0
"Now they've moved down more steps to the depths of shamelessness. They have made some songs UNAVAILABLE to play for free. Even with ads, I can't play, not even find the song. Look for ""laal ishq"" song, using free account (default). It is now listed as a part of ""Premium feature""!! Waah bete, Moj kardi",0
I use it all the time and really love it  Good playlists for any occasion whether Im studying or relaxing ,1
Amazing bro but lessen the adds to like every ten songs instead of twoðŸ’€,1
its great for podcasts and for sleeping sounds,1
I am really enjoying listening to great podcast and music ðŸŽ¶,1
Best App for Quality Music,1
"I am a premium member, for almost a year.I have downloaded playlists and created albums but for the past few months when wanting to play an album it just starts twirling again then I have to stop and manually download everything again which is kinda annoying when in the car wanting to play something and then the downloads are no longer downloaded. I regularly clean the cache and have had to uninstall and re-install often just to have to download everything again. Going 2 try the Lite version now",0
I listen music from this app i heard many song i have giving 5 star to spotify,1
More advertising... Disgusting,0
Spotify is a really good opportunity for everyone to enjoy the world of music.It is really stress relieving ... I love this app â¤,1
Such a disgusting and boring application it is. Continously showing add after each songs.,0
Spotify is now becoming very worse it is playing adds for every two songs all time distance and also less sound for songs,0
Dears kindly i have a problem with the app after i updated my phone as the app does not open,0
Too much ads. Uninstalled. Want a app to listen music not ads,0
Spotify is awesome with providing many songs BUT there are soooooo many that aren't able to be found.,0
The very thing to help me disconnect from real world and focus on my work by listening to music. I guess it really help me go through the day every single day working in the office.,1
"Honestly love this app, use it each and every day, in the car, shower, with friends and church groups, for listening podcasts with friends and playlists to fall asleep, wonder app, I've been on premium for 4 years now",1
There is a glitch in the newest update causing the controls to not always show on bottom of screen while app is open. Also doesn't show media is playing in phone menu's etc.,0
So far so good ,1
"I loved this app so much! I used it every day for hours and got premium. But recently my account won't let me play anything, and it changed the entire set up of my library, removing all my playlists. I tried to make another account and it's the same thing! I would be so happy if you could fix it! Because I love this app, I just can't play anything! (Problem solved! Thanks Spotify!)",1
Great App recommendations from me are get this app plays well if u have slow data awesome that they pre make some list based off your liked artist really enjoy listening to my podcast to.... I could go on and on great app,1
"Spotify has helped me to enjoy music while dancing with my kids, working out, cooking and getting to sleep. Thank you!",1
"It keeps crashing. Also, it tells me to enjoy the next 30 minutes without interruptions but then I'll hear a commercial within the next 5 minutes. Then it tells me again to enjoy the next 30 minutes without interruptions... and then... another commercial within the next 5 minutes.",1
"How does an app that used to work seamlessly turn to a buggy pile of garbage. App won't ""load"" things that are already ""downloaded"" on the app. They take away car mode, so if you don't have a car play feature build into your car you have to open your phone every time to change the song",0
"Playlist list is completely random. They organize it with three different criteria simultaneously: most recently played, creation date and alphabetical. You never know if given playlist is among the recently played or below, among the alphabetically ranged. It might as well be random. It's so difficult to find the right playlist from the list, it's easier to just use the search bar. And even then, the results often show stuff you've never heard before above your most played songs.",0
"Please fix shuffle! I get the same songs constantly, in a playlist of over 1000 songs. Do something to keep track of how recently and frequently a song has been played on shuffle!",1
"Absolute garbage for podcasts.. When u add an episode to a playlist, it kicks you all the way back to episode one.. When you are dealing with audiobooks that are over 100 episodes this is a royal pain in the posterior.. Unintsalled",0
"I loved the app and listening to music for a while, but now the mobile app wont even fully load. Whenever I try to open to app, It stays on the icon screen forever. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing data, clearing cache, restarting my phone, restarting my networks, but nothing is working for me.",0
It's a very nice app and I love Spotify ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
Great for music but the 'playing suggested' is irritating because you can't get rid of them without skipping and only having 6 skips per hour makes it not possible to listen to the music you want.,0
After the new update I am not able to use the app while connected to a WiFi. It shows that no connections available. Kindly fix it as soon as possible.,0
"Spotify is an outstanding music platform, with different genres for all types of music orientated people. Signed G",1
At this point I can't even listen to Spotify on mobile the always shuffle and the skips I can't with them . Today I tried listening to an album and it played songs from another album its really annoying when I look at yall as if not the best music platform but pls change that feature because I'm just a kid and I not paying to unshuffle my songs/album shshushsjsjsjzkzkxkxkxkkxxkxkxkxkxkkxcjcjcjcjjcjcjcjcjxj the v best music platform,0
Nice,1
Best app for listening song,1
Wow! I recommend Spotify to any music lover. Every music genre is available with thousands of songs to create your perfect Playlists. Every song for every mood.,1
its another level to feel amazin',1
"On mobile we can't play the actual song, just a preview or the chorus sadly, but over-all the app is great",1
I really enjoy the app. It doesn't load you down with adds and keeps playing your favorite music,1
"All good except ads. Ads are too annoying to be tolerated! The same ads are played in a loop. Now the app have become quite expensive in its way. Previously it used to give 3 months premium free for any premium pack, but now it reduced to 1 month.....",0
"I love Spotify and I would be lying if I say I didn't use it everyday, but there are some super long ad breaks and Im sad they took away the feature to listen to clips of songs whilst updating playlists. But overall great app.",1
"For some reason, I can't play songs or my playlist. At first I was able to listen in my free time but now I can't. To add to that, everytime I leave Spotify, it logs out on its own! And I downloaded it a few days ago too :( .",0
Find More Songs from your Favorite Artists!,1
Please l request you all songs are play spotify,1
"i love using spotify, but currently on my samsung galaxy s9 i havent been able to pause my music from the lock screen, or play it if it was previously paused. im not sure what to do about that, is there something you can do to fix it? ive tried reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, fore stopping the app, etc. and nothing is working.",0
"There is a new bug in the Android app that means the ""Now Playing"" controls have cometely disappeared so you can't even pause or stop the music without closing the app altogether. Complete lack of response despite hundreds of reports on the ""Support"" message board. After 10+ years, I am cancelling my subscription if it is not fixed by the time of my next payment in three days.",0
Good app,1
Most of the time the app is not conneting. It says internet not available,0
Amazing best song app for podcasts and music,1
I don't know what's going on but the app is experiencing issues. Song stopping mid play. And the bar that pops up when listening no longer pops up so I can't skip I have to manual press a song it's ridiculous and I'm fed iup. FIX IT PLS,0
On playstation ads freeze up the app and it has to be restarted once a week of not more. On my phone I have to force close the app or else it will stay open in the background.,0
Good app all the music artist I love love this app,1
"This app was a huge hit and improved a lot. But personally, with each update this game makes me wanna cry. What's even 6 skips per hour? I'm not even gonna talk about the ads... This app just turned out to be a big disappointmen. Honestly at this point it's even better to pay for YouTube music premium",0
I love it! The idea behind Spotify tells a beautiful story.,1
Good app,1
Its kool with no comercials but it gets lost puts you in music your not playin plus whem your playing music sometimes it sounds like its spitting at you spotify aka spitifyðŸ¤£,0
"Canceled paid services after several years of constant annoyance with this app. Ui sucks. Stations randomly change genres all the time, and now the app crashes every other song. This and prime are the worst of the lot, yt and pandora are hardly better. No customer support, just links to their ""community"" which is equally useless.",0
"Connections issues, episodes start over with ad injections, or just end. Inconstant, battery drains, I've turned off auto downloading, it still tries on cellular and kills my battery, ads are very intrusive and stop the app.",0
Ads are very repetitive but I enjoy the choices. Explicit content can be edited but sometimes songs that have no Explicit content are omitted,0
"Some floors in the app. You cannot have a group of members/friends on a playlist without it being public- meaning, we had people from the other side of the world add spanish techno to our wedding playlist. I have searched how to do it; every user has said it cannot be done. I can not express how bad this is, especially if I pay for this service. Hopefully, the next update will change!",0
Nice app for listening music,1
"Why is the lyrics is not shown when i play the song, i tried to uninstall and install, clear my cache and data but still there is no lyrics.It's just on my phone, my desktop is working well. Then i tried to make a new account and there is lyrics. But i still love my current account :"") Can't this be fix?",0
It won't let me chose the song I want I choose one and it changes to a different song,0
"Resistant to change whats not broken, I only signed up for the Philips Hue sync availability, and I'm thus far pleasantly surprised with Spotify's extensive database, and suggestive algorithms.",1
Sharon likes and loves this it best,1
"unless you get Spotify premium (which isn't cheap) it is pretty much terrible. you can only shuffle albums that include the songs you want, you can't skip songs more than 6 times per hour. and THE ADVERTS. they are every minute with up to 5 in a row! to summarise,, the app really really wants you to purchase one of the premium packages, and it shows.",0
It usually works great but it has deleted all my liked songs and playlists. Sometimes it work on my laptop but the app is basically nonfunctional on my phone.,0
Prima SUPER HECTISCH  THANK YOU       ,1
Spotify player becomes hidden every time I lock phone. It was not problem before but last couple days. I restarted phone to fix problem but problem appears again.,0
Lots of adds ,1
"Latest... Now metal new releases is broken. Apparently there have been only 8 new albums in the metal category since forever. Fix it. Stop being so damned awful, always.",0
Favourite app! Just wish the Playlist auto sorted alphabetically. It makes more sense to me lol,0
Very nice and has a wide range of music ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶,1
ðŸ‘please provide lossless audio files.,0
"Keeps crashing and there is no pause, forward or back buttons",0
My all feeling in this app. When I listen song then my brain in come shantiiðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„,1
I love it Thanks to who ever invented this  ,1
Incredible use and selection. Multiple devices and really great service highly recommended.,1
"Wow... I moved from ios to Android and the lack of care for Android is astonishing. I'm a software engineer and I would have been fired months ago if I released something this buggy and didn't even bother to fix it. This is not acceptable. It's not that it's buggy, it's that there is no care to fix it. Each new release makes the app more and more unstable. Probably priority is ios and Android just gets the crumbs.",0
Song quality is very nice,1
"Keeps nagging about getting the Duo-subscription, something I have no use for.",0
I enjoy selected gospel music,1
"It's good and all but when you look up a certain song it will show a whole lot of different songs even when you are very specific, still not the same songs",1
Wonderful selection of all types of music.,1
It's a great app. I love listening to songs. I do all my work and studies while listening to spotify. The one and only thing that I don't like about spotify is it's ads. It does sting me that an ad comes while listening. I hope spotify adds less ads in-between songs. Maybe like 1 ad in 5 songs. Other than that it's superb,1
"Refuses to play songs i downloaded no matter what i do, buffers when i Fullscreen a song and also doesn't play back songs i put on repeat",0
This app is a app that has all songs you want that's why I always use Spotify.,1
I use Spotify to stream podcasts and listen to music. It's very easy to use and really the best streaming service I've come across. 5 Stars.,1
Still great music streaming app just disappointed that Hifi sound quality not gonna happen. Is obviously for me just use Tidal the most since i have they both because of sound quality. Only the trade off is Tidal have limitation for languages display on the music title. Is the problem when music searching. Algorithm wise fmo spotify better.,0
Exceptional App with 1 missing feature.. you can't search songs within your Playlist which makes it hard to find your favorite songs without going through them all. Please fix this,0
Good selection of music. Easy interface. Keeps free speech! Neil Young isn't that special.,1
This app is trash I tried to log in it didn't let,0
Very good but some music of artist is not there or not in all the languages they perform,0
Ok but why cannot skip ads. It disturb my sound trip.,0
"Pointless app unless youre willing to pay for premium, just plays random music, sometimes from artists you will not even know, so i advise to avoid. Youtube is free, unlimited and probably even less ads. This isnt worth the effort let alone the money.",0
"I can't play songs on the background when I'm trying to open another application, but when it does, it only lasts for mins. I saw some ratings with the same issue but I still updated the app hoping that I won't experience the same but unfortunately it's not. It's really getting annoying, I hope you can fix this as hard as you can. ðŸ™‚",0
i'm ok with the songs but sometimes it says will u like to share with my mom songs is literally so annoying so pls fix it,0
"Awesome. Keep on rolling with the songs,thank you",1
Spotify has always worked just fine for me just wish premium was free but hey Rome wasn't built in a day,0
"It was great before but the music is keep stopping for no reason. So I restarted the app and the phone, it still happened. The app had been glitchy for few months... Very disapppinted",0
I'd rather use YouTube/ YouTube music. At least it gives you enough features while having the ads. Spotify doesn't even play some songs if you don't have a subscription,0
Please stop asking for Bluetooth access. I have to say repeatedly no.,0
I like Spotify but I am using Google podcast and audible. I cannot keep track of the podcast I was listening to on Spotify. Sorry I have to say bye to Spotify because listing to books and podcast experience sucks and I don't want to pay multiple subscriptions.,0
Bangla & Hindi songs collection is so poor! Increase more songs.... ðŸŽ§,0
"You guys have made a really great app.. I really love it and I've gotten premium a couple times. However I feel not being able to play the first song you want in free mode kinda defeats the whole purpose of the app. That's my oy problem with it. Otherwise, really great job.",0
My favorite music app Playlists and music suggestions based on your likes ,1
The quality is excellent but the subtitles is not updated and some were not accurate.,0
"Please stop adding random sounds to my playlists if I don't add them it's annoying. Also I can't skip freely or choose a song on my own on my phone, but on my iPad I can like what? Why? Why not make it the same for phones and iPads/iPhones i won't wait an hour just to skip 6 times.",1
I have adds,1
I used to have the problem with having to wait for the skips and not being able to skip to my favorite songs so if yall don't want that problem just get the account modded version,0
It's so cool. And fun at anytime like when I'm doing dishes I put on music and turn off my iPad it's awsome,1
"Love Spotify, but please move the ""heart"" button so it's not next to the ""cast"" button. I unheart songs all the time and it is so annoying!!! Please move the cast icon to the left of the song titles rather than kn the right next to the play/pause.",0
It's amazing but recently allt the songs randomly stop in the middle of the song or fully cut off and random times frequently even when on premium,0
"Something wrong with the app!! It keeps crashing the last few weeks, play control missing etc., Android version!! Please fix these issues",0
"I wish the system was more fluid and smooth like IOS swiping down on a song to move on to other things like finding new songs, playlists, etc. Other than that, its almost perfect UPDATE: THEY FINALLY DID IT. FIVE STARS",0
Wonderful app to listen to your favorite songs!ðŸ¤˜ðŸ½,1
This app is the worst like come on it doesnt let me play music that i want to listen to it just does the album like come on Audiomack is way better then this now on xbox its fire look plz fix the problem i know yall can be better now prove me wrong spotify and i believe you can,0
Very good App - All the music - old and new that you would love to listen to.,1
The app is going great until it's updated I don't want to be rude but can you please bring back the old Spotify.,1
"Spotify, you're the best music......",1
It's a good app for listening to good music. And it's also good for specific songs. The only problem is the add breaks but over all a good app,1
"Just pretty great, I've got premium and its just lovely. My only real complaint is that sometimes I don't think the shuffle is entirely random but it makes sense why that is.",1
The recent updates make the songs stop randomly and the number of ads make the experience annoying. The now playing freezes on the last song and nothing except stopping the app and relaunching it helps.,0
"It is a very decent app, but it played a different music even tho I'm in my playlist. Can you please fix that? It is very very ANNOYING. Like I only want to play the musics that I put in my playlist then it suddenly played a song thats not in my playlist.",0
"The ""now playing"" bar keeps disappearing so I can't pause/skip songs. Android needs to add a force stop to the pop up menu when long pressing an app for apps like this.",0
Its very discusting tumse achaa toh ganna hai salee spotify net is on tabh bhi no connetion dikha rha hai guys i suggest you download ganna app not Spotify,0
LOVE IT,1
Experiencing issues while searching for a song sometimes. It shows no internet connection even if i am connected to one. This is very annoying. Fix this,0
"So many issues, so so many. Music often stops when screen goes off, no controls for music since latest update so can pick a song but that's it, no pause, skip etc. At least three times a day says I'm not online despite being connected to WiFi in my own house. Honestly if there was a better option I'd get rid, various issues have been present for last few years tbh. The not recognising being connected to WiFi has been going on for years now. Just awful.",0
Works great on my Samsung. Nothing to complain about.,1
Good app almost every single song in the world and no adds.,1
spotify is the best app to listen to music!! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© but sometimes i'm always indecisive on the song i should listen to ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜¹,1
"I normally love the app, however, recently have been having lots of problems with it randomly stopping and losing what is playing so I need to restart the phone to get it to work again (multiple times a day sometimes). The problems have carried on since an update too and I can't seem to find an obvious contact information via the app to report bugs. Am seriously considering changing to another provider...",0
"Okay the Ads are justified but please do no put spooky sounds and advertisements! We will get premium as and when we'll be able to afford it! I was listening to music and in the middle there was an add for -""I can hear you! "" It scared the hell out of me! Please better advertisement will be appreciated by the non- premiere members !",0
This app has been my go to for music and it will be my go to until they take down Spotify love this app,1
"Awesome App and awesome content, I hope they don't get bought / hijacked by some woke remnant.",1
Glad I switched from Amazon!,0
I like it but I don't like the autoplay other songs thingy,0
Everything is great but sometimes my search button stops working like when i click the search button the screen blacks out and spotify app closes. And there are too much ads too,0
Never go offline. The app won't let you sign back in until you change it to online mode. Too bad you need to sign back in to change it back. It's such a stupid problem.,0
The last update screwed this up. I can't even use the slider in my library anymore and have to keep manually scrolling when before I could just hold the slider and go to the letter. This sucks!,0
"I like this app, I can use it whenever I need music, but with every update, I get a step closer to uninstalling this app, I made a Playlist, and everything I try to go on there, it plays a song that isn't even on my play list, and I wish I could block singers from coming onto my list for recommended for you, because some musical artists I think sound like trash, and I can't do anything about it.",0
Very best music ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ app I love it ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—,1
I pay for premium yet my experience gets interrupted by ads from Spotify? Not happy about this I expect the problem to be rectified it's no skin off my back to pirate the podcasts and music again.,0
Very nice app Really liked it,1
Good selection of music. Getting premium is actually worth it with this app.,1
"It's good, I need help... Why can't I put stuff on loop anymore? And why can't i select songs from my playlist?",1
"When is this bug going to be fixed? It's so frustrating. Notify subscribers, we pay for service and it's not good.",0
"Fix the bugs, can't even enjoy music.",0
"So slow, randomly pauses, freezes, annoying when it happens at work. Super annoying.",0
Spotify is only the best when you are on premium â¤ï¸ðŸ”¥,1
Guys stop use this app and more listen adverts then music and... Use your sd or mp3,0
App basically difficult to use with out a premium subscription.,0
"Cuz of network coverage,I'm not enjoying listening to my favourite songsðŸ’”ðŸ’”",0
"Loyal customer of 6 years, they took a lot of my money but I think it's well worth it.",1
App is not working properly and continues to state 'No internet connection' whether I'm connected to wi-fi or not. Most of the time I am connected to wi-fi and would still get this message and I am not able to play any of my songs unless I've downloaded the playlist for offline listening. This has been occurring for months now. Now it is more frequent and the app doesn't even work for me most times. Spotify is great but if I can't listen to my music what's the point of the app or the membership,0
its great i just wish that if you can find a song on youtube you should be able to find it on spotify,1
Most recent update is unstable as f***. Sometimes it'll play your music right and other times it'll tell you nothing is playing despite hearing music coming from my phone. It stops randomly in the middle of songs and starts back sometimes. Infuriating. Also stop asking me to control my Bluetooth devices or to play over my chrome cast.,0
Its a real good music Apple and doesnt lag,1
This app keeps on glitching and pauses my music when my screen turns off. Then it comes back on and pauses again. ever since the latest update I've been having so many problems!!! What did you guys do to this app!!!??? I am about to cancel my premium subscription if this continues,0
Can't just download 1 song from album when rest of album is rubbish amazon you can and so much simpler to use,0
Used to be a great app. Most recent update has made it terrible. It stops frequently and abruptly for no reason (even with downloaded files) and you can't tell what's playing. Please fix it ASAP or I'll be cancelling my premuim subscription.,0
fantastic music but Why delete the SHUFFLE BUTTON Please bring it back,0
Very nice app but there is a issue about free users to much ads are there,0
"The free service on mobile is a hot mess. Plays anything and everything except the album or songs I want to listen to, AND spams me with commercials. Will be looking for something else, and/or getting my music elsewhere on my mobile devices.",0
GOOD,1
best music quality but not able to chose your songs individually without premium,0
"Glitches are running wild, pls fix",0
"Release Radar forever on shuffle? Why won't it let me listen to the songs without being in shuffle? Please fix. :( Everything else is great, though. Thank you!",1
"Been using this app to play music but the recent update is straight up garbage, it won't let me play a single music on loop and whenever it shuffles it automatically plays random music that isn't even in my playlist, whatever I do, even if I exist the song and go back to my playlist it will play the same music, once the song is finished it will play another random song that is also isn't in my playlist! The old Spotify was already great and yet the new update made this all fall downhill",0
If it needs to update it will not work correctly and it will sometimes act the same way even when it it fully up to date it pauses and you need to open the app to restart the podcast then 30 seconds to 15 minutes later it will pause again on its own and I have to open the app again and unpause the episode.,0
I like it because if you turn off the device you can continue listening to your favorite music and go to other pages in the same way you can continue listening and the offers are great ðŸ‘,1
"It's amazing,and higher vibes of God , actually building our souls with many varieties of different gospel songs",1
This is really a good application for song lovers the only reason i couldn't give it 5 star is because the ads are just a bit long so i hope it can be fixed overall the app isn't bad and pretty good,1
"Latest update decreases functionality by removing Car View to upsell to a separate ""Car Thing"" accessory. I have truly enjoyed your service but removing this option is a step backward for me. Will consider switching services. Addendum: still hoping to see a revision that returns the car view to the app. Makes the ease of use far less user-friendly without.",0
Great selection but a larger one would be nice. Puts songs that I like together very well!,1
They have some songs that are pretty hard to find and they come up with the best playlist,1
Very rubbish!! Garbage app irritating to playing advertisement one by one,0
Its fine,1
They ruined it you can only skip 6 times and you can't even see what song is going to play next!!!!!!!!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
"The go-to music app. Only issue is that you can't select your specific song on this version. It's shuffle only and that's a little annoying. Despite that, this app is excellent.",0
can you guys just gave back the preview song on the playlist search song so we can choose a good song?,0
Wooow its working good thnx,1
Lately spotify has been not showing me the song im playing so i cant pause or even skip! Also itll stop playing when my phone is locked.... Like what? And the gidget in the lock screen has always been terrible. Please fix this! It cant be just my phone bc its new and updated!,0
"App is MORE unstable after most recent update, crashes unexpectedly, without even a crash report.",0
It's wonder interference to use . Very user friendly,0
"I really love how premium users can share playlists. I'm able to listen to songs with my boyfriend though we're far from each other. I love Spotify, and I love how I can discover so many songs and just satisfy my music cravings.",1
More advertisement while hearing songs,0
There's no lyrics ðŸ¤§ I wish I could enjoy lyrics too,0
Awesome,1
This is fire. No problems with it and uts super easy to use,1
Functional and easy to use,1
"Really annoyed Spotify have removed support for Kenwood, JVC & Pioneer car stereos. No longer works. This is clearly due to Car Thing and to force car owners to buy it.",0
I was enjoying Spotify until they start playing commercials and not playing my songs from the beginning. I'm having some technical difficulties with Spotify.,0
"Since last update, player bar disappears and music frequently stop playing on its own. This makes the app dysfunctional so will cancel subscription if not fixed soon.",0
This is literally the best way to listen to music as long as your willing to pay for premium and would actually use it enough for it to be useful. That being said I've been using it for 7 years and been paying for premium off and on for about 5 and this is 2022.,1
Good app i like it so much so many song in so many languages good app ever,1
Excellent app with great variety of music !!,1
"Lost count, how many times i've had to force stop this app... ...at least twice a week!!!",0
Web version way better so much things that you have to pay for even simple basic thing,1
I like the app but it doesn't really search for the actual music I want and I can't choose where I want to play the music,0
"Been playing a different 'mood' every day . Spotify is quite smart like that. Today, 'Calipso.'",1
Is it just me or does Spotify regularly just stop playing? This only seems to happen on podcasts. Also and the most frustrating is when the music is playing but there no play/pause rewind/fast forward ui?,0
"I like the choices that I had to choose from. It was easy to choose the app that I wanted,and use that app. Gina Guess",0
"this app is a really great music app , however whenever i make a playlist they always put in songs that they'll think I'll like to my playlist, and its a great thing to some people but it gets tiring hearing songs that i didnt put into my playlist, its sort of annoying. But other than that the app is great.",1
One of the best music apps,1
Great app for all musics,1
I love this app so much. I have been using Spotify for like 4 years and it has rarely posed any problems. I had an issue with swiching what device i was listening on but ir was easilly fixed. Just a suggestion of mine woud to be to like add/make a remote feature or app so if people are listening on like a computer hooked to a tv they can control spotify from a phone easier,0
"I really enjoy using this app, it's the best music/podcast app i've had, but I've had the free plan for a while and the number of ads has increased and I wish that the ads stopped advertising premium so much.",0
App just jumps up and starts itself any time a Bluetooth signal starts up. Will actually turn off a running app to start itself. Deleting until corrected.,0
It's a good app but when I tried to play my own playlist I made it just starts playing random songs that I don't even like Spotify if you can make it an option to make it were the only songs in there are the ones we pick and not some random songs,0
Very impressive and easy to use,1
Has gone from one of the most stable apps on my phone to a pain in the arse app with multiple problems everytime I use it. Now playing bar just not appearing at all anymore. Randomly stops playing constantly. Pause button not responding on various Bluetooth devices. Maybe stop spending so much money on antivaxxer anti science kooks like Rogan and actually put money into fixing these problems?,0
Excellent ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ Superbâ­â­â­â­â­ Fantastic ðŸ’ðŸ’ðŸ’ðŸ’ðŸ’ Multiple choice of song's available Need to improve sound quality....,1
"Buggy, too many adds, the music won't even play properly. It keeps stopping randomly. Can't listen to a preview of a song anymore to make sure it's the right one. It's not even ""Shuffled"", it plays songs in the same order for every playlist. It won't even play the whole of your playlist, you'd only get to listen to half of it because it'll stop suddenly or start playing music that isn't even in it. Can't even log in using password even after changing it. I want to switch apps.",0
"I like it, old music that people almost forget I can play now.",1
Very disappointing that Spotify moves toward information suppression and censorship. I was hoping they could withstand the external pressure to limit all legitimate sides from contributing to the growing body of information and data on Covid-19. You are not giving people more confidence in what we are being told. It is looking more and more like powerful organizations are controlling the narrative.,0
It sucks if u don't pay and sometimes it just plays random songs that aren't even in my playlist and most of the time ads just play and u can get like 6 in a row ðŸ˜,0
"I've been having issues connecting with remote play, my phone doesn't allow me to play songs directly from my favorite/hearted songs. Edit: This has been an issue for almost a year.. half the time I can't play music unless I click the shuffle button, it doesn't let me select individual songs. Not sure what I'm paying for at this rate. Tested on two Pixels and a Moto.. Edit 2: still broken two months later, collectively over a year. should i just give up??",0
Songs stop playing abruptly. No way to continue other than restarting the app. Then you have to manually select the song. This occurs quite frequently now.,0
The app it's fabulous you can get any music you want,1
I keep having to reinstall. App will not function normally for over a month. It plays with the button on pause and there is no way to stop it besides force stop...or uninstall. I pay for premium. About to change to another app.,0
"I love how easy and simple it is to work this app and two ads every few minutes is pretty reasonable. I kinda find it frustrating that you can only choose a few songs until you have to buy premium or wait for a while. It also gets a little bit annoying that you can only select one song at a time to put on a playlist on a phone, but I guess you could easily hop on a computer to do all that. Thanks for the app even though it doesn't meet all the requirements I want, but I'm still pretty happy!ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽµ",1
Love my music and yours,1
App is so slow now after the latest update. Poorly optimised.,0
"I love your different colours feature in different songs,it's sooo beautiful...also very nice ðŸ˜Œ sounds playing always Love â¤ you Spotify for free super quality ðŸŽµ ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ",1
"As of Feb 19 all of my liked songs were deleted from my account. Not how I'd like to wake up in the morning to all the songs I've accumulated from 2016 to have disappeared overnight. If this is a bug, please fix immediately. I honestly love spotify but removing the android offline mode option and then bugs like this are just not fun.",0
"App is garbage now, randomly removes songs from playlists and removes downloaded songs entirely",0
Many data to use its app carrier data use 1gb in 15 minutes its need for Wi-Fi access,0
Works really well most of the time but can go through phases of glitches!,0
I wanna kill my self bc of this it won't let me loop or play the song I want it never did I don't want it to shuffle pls make it a option to turn it off and on it driving me nuts bc I can't do the things I want I have actually cried over this many times bc I was so angry,0
"Everything was good but then the new update happened ): I hope you guys make the links for collaborative playlist valid permanently again because having to send a new link every 24 hours isn't ideal. Also, I hope lyrics had the option for translated and romanised versions",0
"This literally made me want to write a second review because its so hard to work and ads are every 2 seconds, it's even more annoying when it says i have 30 mins to myself and an ad is followed with it after 5 Seconds. I'd give this app 0 stars if I could, but thats not possible so I give you a ðŸ’«1ðŸ’«ðŸ–•",0
"The premier music app. Totally destroyed the pay-for-song model of iTunes. The connectivity between devices truly makes this app an unrivaled king of music in 2022. Just ask my 77,000 minutes of music streaming from last year.",0
"Thanks to Spotify, I've learned the band names, which radio shows rarely disclosed, and by it's suggestions, has opened me up to bands I'd never even heard of before. So happy with it!!",1
"I love the app, but I want the app like I first used it, because it only lets me hear previews of the songs I love, and it plays them randomly when I want to pick the song myself",0
One of the best music applications I've used.,1
Nice,1
"Enjoy Being able to make own Play List. Easy to find older Favorites, and similar albums already collected, for your listening Pleasure.",1
"Been using this app for almost 4 months now, would have given it 5 stars but I have issues every time I try to subscribe, would really appreciate it if you fix this.",0
Good â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ exilent actually ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜.but i just want to download songs through this app so that i can enjoy offline music ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚,1
"Terrible music with this app, I couldn't cancel it fast enough.",0
"Sad that is not free forever, but 5 stars anyway. Good job.",1
I love it. I get all most any song I wish to listen. Thank you spotify.,1
"Constant crashes, even if not listening or doing anything with it, except having it open. Used to work flawlessly. Please hire better programmers?",0
removed all the basic features in resent updates,0
I love spotify because it entails a variety of music from all genres. I love gospel! And there are lots of them in here. Asante sana( from Kenya),1
Great music especially on the go.,1
They removed the option to listen to part of the song when trying to add a song through the recommended area.,0
"Ads are annoying and long but the ""suggested song"" instead of the song I picked to listen is the reason I hated my life untill I got peimium for Christmas.",0
"Lately with the devices app on galaxy A50 I've been running into a bug where the music stops playing randomly. Hope you guys can fix it, big fan of spotify anyways.",0
"Easy , applicable & friendly to newcomers....great app to build up your vibes",1
Nice to listen to songs without Nasty Words from Country Artist from years ago when I want to. ðŸ‘,1
Keeps things different while knowing what you will like!,1
The music recommendations are good. Quality of app is very poor. Constantly crashes. It always loses your place when you're in the middle of a podcast. Takes such a long time to load saved songs and podcasts. It's frustrating,0
App barely functions without internet. App cannot download more than 3 items without being killed and restarted. This app also has serious playback issues. Yt music is somehow a better app.,0
"Won't stop crashing, no matter how many times I uninstall and reinstall it. Edit: now it also refuses to play certain podcasts. Fantastic.",0
best music experience and no Spotify without harry styles,1
I wish I could share my liked song list to friends :(,0
"keep showing really explicit content in the home, even when the filter is activated. cant remove the podcast section from home.",0
"Some songs (""Old Man"", ""Down by the River"" and more) vanished from my (paid subscription and downloaded) library",0
Love this app! It is great at finding new songs for you based on your listening.,1
Awesome music app where you can listen to the music from your own library or suggested daily mixes and different genres.,1
It's a great app but there's constantly updates which are annoying,0
"I love it! I can pick lots and lots of songs that i like,thanks for this amazing app!",1
Very friendly and cool app. I enjoyed old music......,1
Best streaming service out there,1
"Great music, can send stream to Echos, computer, TV, phone, etc",0
only problem is using phone as a remote is insanely laggy I DONT TO LISTEN YEAT BUT I CANT SKIP,0
I'm speechless this app is amazing.,1
The past couple of months have been horrid. The buggiest app I've ever come across. Please fix!,0
Compares to Telkom joox this is the best music app ever love it more expecially when it comes to changing songs and no ads i love it keep it upâ¤â¤â¤ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦,1
And theres all types of music that you enjoy even comedy Too bad it doesnt contain videos,1
Great for listening offline Thanks Spotify,1
"Terrible to listen to use for listening to music if you don't have premium. I just use it for podcasts. But there are so many glitches that the team refuses to fix, despite the amount of people having these issues, with no fix available. If you want people to pay, then at least provide a good experience.",0
Again and again add premium oohhh,1
So many advertisement. Do not play the songs on your playlist ( different songs). Only allowed 6 skips.,0
"I'm a student in a University that has been on strike for 3 months plus, how am I supposed to have a document with a recent date from the University. Don't be partial.",0
"It's a great app, i just wish the playlists were not shuffled by songs that are not in the playlist",1
I really like the app but recently I've been having troubles with it (it pauses on the music and the listening bar disappeared) and I'm paying for a service without pauses and I really don't want to change to another app cause I already got used to this one so please fix the problem!!,0
It is a very nice music app But The problem is the ads coming continuesly despite that it's a very good music app,0
Hate that random songs can just come next when playing a specific album from my country. But it's a good app. Not too many ads. Love that,1
Even after deleting app it keeps showing up on my notifications panel of my phone. Do not download!,0
"Pretty sound, pls give us back the preview thing when adding songs",0
"So far so good... Love the home page,",1

"Recent update, the now playing doesn't come on reliably. Ear pods lose functionality unless I restart it. Please fix this. Google Pixel 6 Pro",0
The best app for music has a bit off adds if not taken premium but good as heck,1
Can't even listen to a song - it plays some random other songs it added to the playlist instead.,0
Great mixes. Quality sound. Highly recommended!,1
Seriously get your act together... Last update jacked it up... Play bar keeps disappearing where I can pause/play/change song and have to close and reopen it to get it to come back... This is unacceptable... FIX IT!,0
"It's good for a while,I was using it for a week and now its only going on preview. I have tried everything! Please tell me what else i should do. I would like an answer for why it is going on preview!.",0
This is amazing. I really like itðŸ’œðŸ’œ #spotifyðŸ’œðŸ’œ,1
The music is great but what pisses me off is the tiny yet important details. I have been trying to login to Spotify on my pc for weeks now but I do not remember my username or password and the app doesn't have a section where I can get that information this sucks and I won't be renewing my premium subscription,0
Very good experience.....with spotify i'm enjoying a lot....,1
None of the links to share things work. They just open the app or the week player and don't take you to the thing you're trying to share.,0
"Songs don't show when you play them can't pause or skip to the next one, fix this asap",0
"It REALLY wants to push you to listen to community/automatic playlists and podcasts. As someone who likes to listen by the album, or occasionally a single song, the interface is incredibly convoluted. I don't want to discover songs, I just need to play them. Only good thing is the music selection, they have some very obscure bands here.",0
Its a good app for music but the ads ðŸ˜… they are very annoying ðŸ˜¡ but I just bought a premium membership just a request give download option for free users,0
I love this app I would have given 5 stars but in the last 3 weeks it has been messing up and when I play music it shuts off and also it says Spotify is having trouble playing the song,0
This is really my favorite app! The best listening to music application ðŸ˜™,1
More commercials than songs. Disappointing.,0
"I,m old school,so I've been able to find songs from the sixties to the present. If a person know,s how to mix old with our new era of music partying will be ,as the young generation says Keeping it ðŸ’¯.",1
With just a small monthly fee I'm able to get access to all the albums I've ever dreamed of listening to,1
Just like it,1
"Incredible, the weekly new fines based on the genre of music you're the same too. Always finding new music that I enjoy.",1
It's good I enjoyed all of the songs The quality is next level....... ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ’†â€â™€ðŸ’†â€â™€ðŸ’†â€â™€ðŸ’†â€â™€,1
"Spotify has every song I have ever looked for, including Shazam songs from television shows I watch. The playlists they create for me have gotten me through the brightest and darkest days in my life for over a year. Music heals and Spotify has a song for everything. Thank you.",1
As a paying customer there is nothing I can say about Spotify. It is perfecto.,1
 loved it ,1
I listen to this great app everyday and be looking out for my single @bmkdon,1
"Great ability to explore music, without being diverted or distracted!",1
The app started to turn off music randomly without any reason. After pressing play again it resets song.,0
"I've tried literally everything I could find and for some reason I cannot listen to the podcasts that I'm subscribed to. Everything else works fine with some minor glitches that I can deal with. It's just for some reason, while i was listening to the podcast, it decided for me that I had listened to it enough and stopped playing for me.",0
"it's a good experience at first, especially with Premium, but over time the app started to glitch and the songs I downloaded to listen offline always came out and I had to download again later. after a while my songs disappeared from my favorites and i had to uninstall Spotify to get back to normal (this made my phone restart).",0
"Please, I'm having a hard time trying to play the podcast videos, I've cleared my cache, uninstalled the app..but still can't see the video.",0
Absolutely brilliant Playlists,1
"I've been paying for my premium only for me not to enjoy adds free and download,really disappointed",0
Pushing the agenda. They could have stayed neutral. I am now cancelling my subscription.,0
"The ""get best experience by allowing Bluetooth"" is getting iritating, stop it now.",0
"This app is very good! I like Spotify, it's just that I don't like that you can only get 6 skips every hour!ðŸ˜’ Other than that I like this appðŸ‘ðŸ˜„",1
I know Spotify is the BEST!!! Music app,1
After update is working terrible. Already deleted the app and installed back and still working like trash ðŸ—‘,0
Great! I am really enjoying this app! Thank you!,1
Why. Why. Why. Why does Spotify keep deleting my saved songs on my SD Card?????,0
"The app is OK in ipads or big devices, but in phones, it only shows playlists. Please help how to fix!!",0
"I would like to request that please also show who liked our playlist, other than that the service is good",1
Spotify on phone is good but web player is really bad... Sometimes the song isn't even coming out but the time of the song is running.. I thought it was problem with my laptop but later found out it's the same case for many of my friends... There's something wrong with spotify web player please take a look at it,0
Who legitimately thought that having the play/pause button on the left was a good idea? I refuse to believe there are actual humans working at Spotify. Singlehandedly one of the most stupid changes I've had the misfortune of seeing,0
My only and favorite app for music. I pay for premium to skip all the commercials but enjoy the fact you can follow friends playlists and make multiple playlists of your own in the library. Best music app thus far. ðŸ’š,1
Good music Good app no ads,1
"ads, Ads,ADs,ADS,AND MORE ADS then when you think they stopped AD RIGHT THERE",0
Great,1
the best! they have a lot of songs!,1
"app just suddenly ceased to work properly, can't even browse or play any songs (samsung galaxy s9 plus)",0
I just took the 1 month trail of premium and the app starts to hang constantly and freezes all my other apps. Really annoying.,0
This is such a great app I can Listen to as much kpop as I need,1
I liked it but for me it doesn't let me look at the lyrics idk why tho also it only shows the story line of the song but not the lyrics can someone help me?,0
ok,1
I subscribed to Spotify Premium for years but I unsubscribed when I learned they are supporting antivaxxers. Shame on you Spotify.,0
Lanjodaka,1
"Lately only shows a blank screen at least 50% of the time when loading the app. Have to close the app and reload of multiple times before it will work. Getting jumpy also in the middle of songs and fragging for a few seconds before resuming play. Not good especially as I pay for a premium account as Spotify isn't worth, using in my opinion, with a free account (features are too poor and very buggy).",0
"It was good for a long time. But it started to lag and play randomly. I will be deleting this app. I updated it, restarted my phone and everything.",0
The app crashes constantly during song play. Just started doing it today.,0
Gitchy at times. Front loaded ads to the point I just shut off and go elsewhere. Thought about paying for premium but not if they cant even figure the basics out.,0
"Recent update seems to have broken something. Music keeps playing in the background with no song info in the app, therefore unable to skip, like, pause or whatever. I hate that this is the state of a paid service. Please fix asap.",0
Too much and too long ads.,0
"Okay, back to 5 stars. Casting to join group queue makes up for removing QR scan.",1
Where the hell did the current playing screen go on mobile? Can't see the current song I'm playing to scroll through music or even skip song that are playing. Locked my phone hoping the widget would come up but nope...? Why?,0
Edit: its getting worse. I can't pause. Interruptions are often. not sure what's happening but my it randomly stops playing and has trouble starting when I get in the car. I'm up to date on updates. I cleared the cache. Any suggestions? I have a paid plan.,0
Awesome but a bit two many commercials I don't mind some for free I expect it but it seems like there is getting to be to many,1
It's menu is full of things and isn't easy to navigate. I've been using for months Spotify and I don't get used to it.,0
"Whenever i add songs to my playlist, i always hear other songs thats not in my playlist at all, like song that im completely unfamiliar with.",0
"I love Spotify and I've used it for a long while now, but recently when I click on my playlist and click ""Add Songs"" it won't let me click on recommended songs to hear short examples before adding it to the playlist. I'm really annoyed about this and I'm not sure if it's from a new update but if it is BRING IT BACK PLEASE!!!",0
Some performance issues not the most simplistic user experience but along time subscriber of 5years,0
I have no clue why people put bad Reviews on this app it is actually not as bad as these people describe it. There is adds but how else would they make money I mean there's not that many sooo that should not be something to be complained about. This app has a variety of songs so I think this app it amazing.,1
Group sessions sometimes don't work.,0
Best app execpt the advertisements.. Everything is good,1
I really enjoying listening ðŸŽ§ to music it's so amazing,1
Now playing bar dissappears every half an hour. Can't control the music I'm playing.,0
Bc app,1
Worst app ..not at all loading in 150mbos connection,0
This app use to be a good app but now it's just bad. I make a playlist with my fav songs and I can't even play them and I can't even listen to my song that I chose without going through other songs first. THIS APP IS A NIGHTMARE.,0
App is crashing when play button is pressed after update,0
"Mine just stop opening this July 2022, Its stuck at loading screen (spotify logo) and doesnt open the app at all. Tried uninstall/install - clear data/cache - phone is up to date - app is also up to date. Please support ðŸ˜”",1
"Very good app,I like it a lot because stay playing the same tipe of music that I put it to play. A+",1
It crashes midway through a song sometimes but honestly having all my favorite music(except a few) in one place is worth the minor annoyance.,1
I am removing this app due to the company allowing misinformation to remain on your platform. When given the choice to be part of the solution you chose the dark side. I will encourage others to do the same.,0
"It is a nice app overall, but the ads which pop up after every 2 songs are very annoying.",0
"I don't know but the Spotify official equalizer on the iphone don't have on the android, Spotify is prioritizing apple than android please make it available the original Spotify Eq. On Android device just like on apple devices.",0
The best platform for music now. I often forget I have a music player on my phone,1
I used to love this app now when I click a song it plays another song ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¾â€â™€ï¸,1
Nice apple; music is have all and no need premium you still can listen,1
Too many ads,0
Had this app but uninstalled after they removed Neil Young music. Now using Pandora instead.,0
app not functioning properly for months. Music play/pause button not showing.,0
A Great experience when you can see the progression of your own music on here flourish you provide a lot for us musicians keep the good work up and fighting for the artists rights and best interest,1
Was hesitant on getting it. Tried the free trial a couple years ago... Love it!,1
Hate the new update to playlists. Scroll bar not working anymore ever since last update. Used to be able to hold the scroll bar and quickly find songs through out my playlists. Now I have to manually scroll past my thousands of songs. Will uninstall,0
I'm a premium user but the app itself fails a lot and the way buttons are suddenly changed from position on screen is a pain in the @$$ been using YouTube music and works well plus you got the videos...,0
This app is awesome but the ads every now and then take a while but other than that the app is amazing great sound,1
"I cant pay for premium everytime i try to re new my details it loads the same exact page to me, i spent an hour trying to fix this to no avail fix this. I tried paying with go pay but couldnt at all",0
"A Great listening experience!!!Love the stations(genres),pods...all of it! Thanx Spotify ðŸ”ŠðŸŽµðŸŽ¶â¤ï¸ðŸ§¡ðŸ’›ðŸ’šðŸ’™ðŸ’œðŸ¤ŽðŸ–¤ðŸ¤â™¥ï¸",1
Good app for music But not for downloading offline Else app is awesome,1
"*an alright app, especially when not using premium but some issues I just don't dig;; 1. unavailability to save queue as a playlist 2. shuffle doesn't work unless you skip the song,, is when it finally shuffles 3. search should have a filter when it comes to searching for playlists (I'm new to using this app, bare with me) to have an ascending-descending option n vice versa, when it comes to likes and playtime",0
I just paid for a mini premium 3 times and it shows that the money has been cut of from my account but the mini premium choice isn't appearing on my Spotify account I want the money back if the mini premium won't be used in my account,0
This music ðŸŽµ app is amazing it doesn't disappoint at all,1
"Too many bugs & things that will drive you crazy! Been using this app for many years because it is so integrated into life, but it's terrible. Continuously has issues connecting to devices properly. Constantly has issues playing your playlists, especially liked songs. It will always just start playing once your phone connects to your vehicle regardless if you want it to or not, no way to shut that off. Never any info online on how to fix issues except telling you to update or reinstall app.",0
Overall good experience saved all my downloaded music and podcasts great quality sound,1
This is the best app. You get all the recent songsðŸ˜,1
Crashing non stop. Been a premium user for nearly a decade. About to cancel soon.,0
Why remove your alphabetical ordering system in your liked artists for an ungodly mess of an algorithm??? Why insert geolocation ads into podcasts on certain artists?? Spotify is certainly a good ad for its competitors,1
"Hi. I consider myself a great healer and for me the platform is safe ðŸ™ for my friend, blessed day developers ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜œ",1
I've always liked Spotify and how it adjusts to my music tastes and changes. The sele tion of available artists and songs is also awesome.,1
Cool it's just cool you can listen to your favorite songs and every song it just depends if it's on there it most likely is though,1
"It's really good to listen to music, but it is a pain to use. The app doesn't open most times when I try and I have to press library for example, multiple times and wait at least 30 seconds to actually open the page. And every time, it doesn't connect to the speaker, I have to open it again which takes a while, and then it connects. I'm on a galaxy s9",0
"Great music app, however some great songs are unavailable. I know this may be out of the companies control but it does suck whenever I want to listen to a song only to find it is unavailable.",0
It doesnt let me in because I dont meet the age acquirement,1
"Best Music App by far, I also use Shazam and Waze which intwine with Spotify... Not complex and easy to use, well organized Interface.",0
"The lyrics section is so jittery can't stand it anymore, annoys me. Spotify forgets to shuffle the very old songs you liked and I don't know why Spotify don't do it right it's the few same songs that keeps on shuffling in the liked songs section. Spotify if this message reached you please look into it. I love songs in my playlist but it forgets to play those songs and I annoyingly have to play manually.",0
I have tried and tried to like this app would get the premium but I can't even get the free version to work correctly never will play the songs I actually want to hear will always play a random song. I have tried and tried and can never hear the song I want. Waited weeks for a release for a artist I love and can't even listen to the song. You click on it and it plays other song by her or another random artist. I'm just over trying this app anymore,0
"Keeps deleting liked songs for no reason, it show but skip them. Than I look them up and on their like if I didn't have them starred/liked. Even paying for the premium, but starting to second think the app",0
"I can't play a song whatever way I want. I can't play one song at once and unless I get premium, I can't replay a song unless I play all the other songs on a playlist. It limits too much things.",0
Keeps cutting out and not showing what song is playing,0
I am using Spotify premium and Podcasts are not working anymore. Big downgrade. Do sth about it and soon.,0
"Only got the free version, but it is really good. Lets you play music with a few ads every now and then. Can make playlists etc.",1
"Spotify is always my go to for music. Update June 13 killed the speed. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it but it now takes 20+ seconds to skip or respond to any action. I hope that gets fixed soon or I'll have to shop elsewhere. Too bad, because I use it a few hours a day",0
"I've noticed they use fake artist names on songs they got off of epidemic sound, not cool, they also have record labels using bots to Inflate artists views...",0
I'm having a problem with music crashing the app when I use it and it's getting to the point to where I might uninstall and stop my premium account.,0
just plays music and podcasts it good can connect to crome casts laptops and playstation don't know about Xbox I don't have one I was playing music and got 6 ads with out 30 minuets of ads a disgrace,0
The plus deals like the duo and family are incredible and I have had my entire family switch from radio to making playlists,1
"Now playing missing, randomly pausing",0
I love the app but the ads suck!,0
I will be a loyal customer. Very intuitive and easy to navigate.,1
Love spotify a y music I'm in the mood for I can get o spotify,1
I like the app and the music's there are there's some music that isn't there but most of the ones I like are there but I hate that there's many ads after just 1 or 2 songs. Amazing app just sometimes to many ads,0
i just edited my rating from 5 to 4 cause I think it bug or something that after few song it stops playing even its active in background ðŸ˜…,0
Stops playing after a few minutes with the screen locked. This is the only app that does that on my tablet.,0
For me the app is a little irratating. Doesnt always show on my playing now. I have to close out and reopen for it fof the app to catch up when i switch from one pod cast to the next.,0
Absolutely perfect excellent,1
Its a good app I love it and idk why people are complaining about the ads,1
Keeps crashing on Android with current build of app,1
I live for this app. I've tried many music apps and this is by far the best.,1
It is an amazing app and I just get to the mood and it has all of the world's songs and you can change your profile and profile name and pic,1
Best app for music lovers and broadcast listeners. Must recommending this.,1
Great app wouldnt be without it,1
"Currently unable to listen to some of my favorite podcasts. Whether on data or on wifi, they never load. Others ready up immediately. Update: still an issue, podcasts work on the computer but never load on phone",0
"We like having it, lately though to change a song you have to unlock your phone and get into the app, where before it would pop up on the locked screen. Huge drawback! And recently it will play songs that aren't in my downloaded folder.",0
Spotify plz fix the damn issue of songs getting stuck in one playlist. ðŸ˜¡ When I play another playlist or que a song song will not go to that and it will play a song from that stuck playlist.. plz fix it I have to install uninstall multiple times to fix this still keep coming,0
Bait and switch does not apply I guess.,0
This is good,1
Great way to listen to all my favorites for the 90's and 2000's.,1
Good but I think it's ridiculous that we have to pay for podcasts and they're giving Joe rogan millions of dollars so I don't even give a s*** about that.,0
A great app with all the best music,1
The list of artists is just amazing. Music heales the tired and stressed body.,1
"Keeps randomly stopping on Samsung S20. Logged out, changed password, uninstalled, reinstalled, still just randomly stops. Used to be good.",0
"Normally love my premium but since the last update, if I have podcast and music on the same playlist. When the podcast ends, the music doesn't play like before. And that's very annoying it just closes the app. When I'm in a busy work day I'd like my playlist to play like it should. And not make me need to open the app again to select music. Please fix.",0
"It is a pretty good app for like listening anywhere with a good experience, yea there is ads but they only last for a couple pf seconds",0
When I play song app automatically get close that is a rubbish thing I don't like it please do something I event can't play songs that's why I am giving one star rating fix that problem please,0
Brilliant for a 73 year old geezer good old 60 music,1
I absolutely love the different podcast it offers that's what keeps me going through my day plus I like the fact that it personalizes my music.,1
Its amazing you can have so many playlists and songs just the ads probably have to go,1
It's a good app but it won't play the songs In my playlist and when I try to it plays songs that aren't even in my playlist,0
I'm going out with a knee problem but the most important thing is that the one I was thinking about you all day tomorrow so will have a great time and effort into it would have to do with a knee problem but the most important thing is that the one I was thinking about you all day tomorrow so will have a great time 5th and effort into it would have to do with a knee problem but the most important thing is is is is is is is is is is is that the one,0
Awesome app! Almost every artist and almost every song from every artist. It's great being able to save stuff for listening to later and making personal playlists 10/10 ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»,1
nobody is perfect but this app is pretty close to that,1
Could have less ads but cool app,1
Very reliable for me...loved Wide selection in all,1
I am Eclectic with my music that's why I love Spotify â£ï¸,1
"Great for music, I love listening to podcasts and Spotify has an amazing selection, however I have found the queue not Great with podcasts listening in order. If you could autoplay podcast series in order or my queue as selected then I will give you way more stars!",0
"All OK with app , lost some stuff when changed phone though for some reason ðŸ¤”",0
I have the Spotify app downloaded on my galaxy watch 4. Everytime the screen times out the music pauses. Any ideas on how to fix this?,0
Great music app except the adds all other things are quit well. My experience with Spotify is really mindblowing.,1
Ads are really irritating,0
Very nice music application,1
"I have been a subscriber for many years now, and I have never had any problems with this app. Lately, I have noticed that my music will stop playing for no apparent reason with complete internet access. Also, I am now unable to scroll through my playlist, which is odd. I don't know if this is occurring because of a recent update, but I am hoping this issue will be fixed soon.",0
Listen if yall think we get irritated by not being able to turn off shuffle not being able to skip music and not being able to navigate through songs to make us buy your premium you might be right but I enjoy it as I found many awesome songs to listen because of that ,1
"App not connecting to wifi , tried all options and recommendations. Please fix this",0
This app keeps skipping and play songs when it pleases. I uninstalled at least 3 times. Worked for a few minutes then started messing up again.,0
It's pretty good I'm alright with only a limited amount of skips because they are all song I like so it's pretty good I would probably recommend it.,1
"we've been reaching out to ur customer service regarding this issue and we did not receive any response at all. your app has been hacked. when we play the song MONEY by LISA on TTH playlist, it plays other song from another artist. fix this!",0
"This app, Spotify, has excellent music!",1
Love  LOVE  TRUE STORIES ,1
App is nice but u can improve the sound quality,1
No longer syncs liked songs and play lists,0
Have had the app for years good app but seriously for the love of god stop trying to reinvent the wheel with the UI. Current one they just updated too doesnt show the song now playing half the time. Go back to the old UI without all these silly tiles ill never press on. Im not one to write reviews but for the good of the people it needed to be said,0
Last few updates have been garbage. Hard to justify to keep premium when you can't listen to your music half of the time.,0
"Garbage app. Crashes several times a day,every day. Can't wait for Rogan to leave Spotify so I can too!",0
Having the same problem with the app crashing as others are having. I did the last two updates... because it was crashing... still crashing. No play bar at the bottom and have to close the app to stop the audio when playing.,0
Updated the app because it kept crashing when I tried to look at the queue. It did not help it sadly. Lately the app has taken a real turn for worst and keeps malfunctioning. Everything else on my phone works fine and I've seen similar complaints here,0
I love the app and the premium prices are reasonable. The only problem I have is that it's a bit tedious adding songs to a playlist.,0
Has a lot of music I like Some older albums by some artists don't seem to be available but not bad oversll,1
I have to try the music it to make a comment .Thank you Wendybrader. have mainly used Google but l am willing to try after someone can give me advice how to use it and be successful. x,0
30 min add brakes are a lie but otherwise good in my opinion,1
I do like the app but I don't like how there is limited skips and its so annoying I hope they fix that.,0
Still a very good app. The earliest versions of the app were superior (0.7) but I find I can do everything I want with this app. Great compatibility with corresponding apps for Spotify connect on a number of platforms.,1
To listen one sang I have to listen 4 ads,0
EDIT: SOUND QUALITY STILL SUCKS.,0
I love it I have been using this for music a lot,1
It is brilliantly organised so that I can listen to the music and comedy songs I love just just on one app a easy way to make as many playlists thank you Spotify,1
My life revolves around music. Great app,1
The app is good because you can turn off you phone,1
"I've heard 3 songs and 9 advertisements. I time the ""30 min of free listening"" and it's 22 min between advertisements. Also, pay the artists that you're making money off of. I'm not paying for a subscription when artists only get a couple cents from you.",0
"cheap premium, great quality, every song i think of is on here and im into a lot of pretty niche music, works well even on poor internet which is great. i could listen to music seamlessly even on the second basement level in the car park.",1
"This app is the finest app for Music Lovers! The sound quality is so pleasing, you can not stop listening! In all types of Music numerous verieties by various singers! Above all, it is smoother and easy to operate and enjoy! No Comparision can be made! It may appear to be costly, but clearity,quality & variety count above all! Yoo can enjoy at anytime,anywhere and by any means, i.e mobile, tv, bt or tablet! Hats off!",1
"I tried it and decided to subscribe. I was using another music service, but Spotify seems to have better suggestions that are relevant to me.",0
"great app altogether but the most recent update has removed the ""now playing"" banner. hoping this gets fixed soon so we can all get back to enjoying it :D",0
"I love Spotify, but I wish we could play songs without do many ads or having to use premium. But y'know do what you gotta do I guess. Great so overall!",1
Please include an option where we can request a song which we want to include in Spotify. I think Spotify is missing some good tracks in some regions,0
"Complete song, i like rock and folk song",1
The ads in the app is making it retard. Please reduce the amount of ads,0
This is just another useless waste of time. I'm deleting it immediately because they no longer believe in free speech.ðŸ–•,0
Too many adds . Can enjoy music.,1
"Updated it about 2 weeks ago, now the player glitches out and just dispears and randomly stops playing. Very dispioting after using the app for 2 years without any big problems.",0
"Too much tracking, same songs over and over on every playlist. They removed some of my favorite artists to make room for podcasts. I don't use podcasts why is this Apple music now? I delete the app frequently because it doesn't function well either and the only way to get it to work again is reinstall. They haven't really fixed anything after years of complaining, you try to edit your playlists and they never appear as edited. Clearing cache does nothing to fix any of the many problems.",0
Best app if wanna explore some new songs that you haven't listened already .,1
Ok,1
I love to listen to music,1
"App recently has a lot of bugs, including randomly pausing or disconnecting. Also when I take out headphones randomly stsrts, playing on my phone and app has no pause button",0
I've had to uninstall Spotify because for 2 months it's been randomly playing especially when I switch apps since I jnstalled the latest Android OS. I've uninstalled and installed several times. I haven't received any useful solution from Spotify customer support. It's becoming a nuisance and I'm now considering other music services though I'd rather have Spotify. I hope Spotify support reads this.,0
"Seriously, just use youtube music. The shuffle mechanic is broken, you can only listen to your playlists once and then bam, recommended songs you don't like. Plus, you can't listen to particular songs in a playlist and you only get six skips an hour.",0
Make your application more slowerr! You are more slower than windows 98! Why dont you do black and white on the app to make it more 1098,0
"I've been using Spotify for many years now but recently there has been a bit of bug that has just been getting worse since Christmas. For about 3-4 months now, every time I open the app in the evening, I can put on a podcast but the app does not recognise I'm playing anything and therefore, won't let me open the tab to adjust my timer. I have been able to fix that by closing the app and starting it again but this is not working today. It is making the app almost unusable to me.",0
Nice app for music lover.,1
Would be great to be able to swipe the currently playing song in/out rather than tapping the arrow.,1
"Spotify has become smoother since my last review, so I have to clear the app out of history a lot less. I'm not a big fan of the new plus button in the bottom right corner. I don't need to make a new playlist so often that a dedicated spot in the menu is necessary and I don't make podcasts at all. This button is functionally pointless for me and moved the other buttons that I used slightly to the left. Overall, still a great app. I'm just nitpicking the constant changes to the UI.",0
I love Spotify you get to listen to songs while doing games and other things also Spotify is really good becuase I love it becuase there is so many songs that I â¤ ðŸ˜ I hope I have told you enough thank you for listening I hope you all have a nice Spotify day!,1
"Please fix bugs for Samsung Galaxy, this is an actual joke - now playing button disappears, and Bluetooth connection continually cuts off. App is currently unusable.",0
"Gives high quality songs with good recommendations too. There is a glitch, when I open Today's Top Hits and scroll down it Shows Spotify,Amount of likes and time. Please Fix it.",1
Love this app good choice of music and podcasts,1
I love this app but when i play the song that i want it keep playing random song that i dont know and it makes me angry pls fix this we want to listen the songs that we want and have fun listening to it. Its like when you want to listen on something but spotify do their own decisions to play random songs that you didnt heard before.,1
Great selection. Better price than others,1
"Similar to other reviews, the app has become so unreliable in the last 6 months or so. Not loading properly, shutting randomly etc. Getting close to cancelling for YouTube music.",0
The algorithm us just perfect. Im addicted to it.,1
Sexy,1
A Glitch keeps removing the play bar at the bottom and so i cant play or pause podcasts or music so i have to reset phone. Please fix this!,0
By far my favorite music app. I just wish they had more underground songs...,0
stop adding songs to my playlist that is the most annoying thing ever and stop also bashing artest for there album covers just because yall dont want to look bad theres even tho theres alot worse things on here than a album cover like really,0
"What's going on, keeps pausing, really annoying",0
Spotify has been easy to navigate and also has very cool podcasts and music Playlists you can listen to. No glitches or issues as of yet with the app. I like it.,1
Great application for having a large selection of music if you can get past their darkside as a company.,1
"Everytime I want to turn my music off I have to restart my phone, no option to skip a track either, not good â˜¹ï¸",0
"This is the worst podcast app I have ever used. The only reason I need to use it is to listen to Armchair Expert, which is sadly an exclusive show. The playback stops abruptly, downloads get deleted in the middle of playing an episode, you need active internet to even access downloads, making the user experience utterly horrible. Not that I expect any better from a morally bankrupt corporation. Sigh.",0
You like music? Here you find everything you want. It can recomed the exact type o music you listen.,1
"Spotify is ok but it needs some revamping. Better, more coherent, yet easy to navigation. Second Spotify needs to fix a bug it has created by making itself the default audio file player of the user's phone. Unresolved complaints have been ongoing since January that the app force opens our private audio files without permission, making the phone's default audio player rendered inert and you can't fix it without uninstalling Spotify. Spotify does this with permissions set to OFF.",0
Are you going to increase profit.... Startung time its become good.. now its too waste ... Soo better to improve more features to user friendlyy,0
"stop begging for permissions! every time I open app I need to deny Bluetooth, while listening trough Bluetooth headphones. also... Free experience is 1*. In other words, listen to constant ads intermixed with couple of songs. Honestly makes me too annoyed to even consider premium, and rather go Amazon or Google music...",0
Dogshit without premium. They play random songs that you can skip only 6 times/hour. You can't even listen to what you want. Greedy,0
"It's good, like it alot it just the commercials. But apart from that it is all good",1
If i even try to play a song that i want to play it plays another one i try this over and over again but the song i want to play never plays,0
"Better than apple music , one of the best music app ever listened to",1
Nice app....but there are so many ads in it....its so disturbing....so please remove ads...,0
Perfect,1
Its Amazing.Although i putted spotify on my sons gaming chair that the sound is to loud put Spotify is a GREAT App,1
It sucks! I purchased for the premium and the app keeps crashing!,0
"App is updated, have restarted my phone, but keeps force closing. Please fix",0
"This app is just OK, but the unsubscribe process requires way tooo many times clicking cancel! I have made my mind, don't force me to click cancel 5 times to unsubscribe. I clicked it three times last month and thought I was done with it and was charged again for this month, which feel very shity and inresponsive. Worst way to keep clients!",0
It's good but the new update is not too good bc i want play the songs in my playlist but you add songs i don't want too hear and you play it when i want to chang it from my playlist but it dosen't work it just play part of it and i hope you change that,1
Longtime user. Started using Spotify in 2008 before the laws allowed use in the USA. Imn so here. Enough for you? Free is great too but Im paying premium. Very strong. Waiting for HD to start.,1
"I Cant even login on my Android after trying literally everything, please do fix this one hell of a bug!",0
Best online music platform ever.,1
"The reason a fee paying customer does not recieve ""lyrics"" when they're actually paying good money for the favility, is because hhe failt is at Spotify. Customer's shouldn't need to uninstall and reinstall and fanny around with their phones and trying all other manner of fixes. The fault is at Spotify not on thousands of people's phones like the stupid fixes posted on YouTube and a thousand other places suggest.",0
Wonderful music to work by and easy to select tunes and artist that I enjoy the most. Great variety,1
The very best app for listening to music!,1
"I searched for a song, tried to play it and Spotify plays somethings totally different. There's nothing great about this app, I don't understand what the hype was about. YouTube Music is still the best!",1
It plays random songs that aren't in my playlist even when I turn the option for it off,0
"Just love this app ,no complain on the scale of 1 to 10 this app is 11",1
update is absolutely terrible. completely change the layout and it's now an eyesore and very confusing.,0
Love Really easy to use this app,1
Reduce the ads,0
I liked this app a lot before. Now I'm uninstalled this bcz of the new update. I can't hear my fav song by my own. I have to wait for it to shuffle play. Or I have to upgrade to vip. Oh man it's really getting weird. for ad I can wait and listen but can't choosing the song really getting mad. Thank you for your service.,0
Toooo much of ads literally too many ads I cannot bare it after 1 music 1 ad what the heck is this. If you download this app for hearing music.. You are wrong you will hear only ads if you download this app.... ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ so many ads.. I recommend you to download resso it is better than Spotify 100000X times to less ads in resso,0
Phenomenal,1
Please update again as you have broken Spotify with the last update,0
"Download for any particular song is not available, at home page ther is only playlists add some song too ........",0
"This is a really great app but sometimes it says ""no internet connection"" even though we have WiFi and I don't know why it happens. It's kinda annoying me because I always listen to music before sleeping. I hope you guys can figure out why is that happening and fix it, thank you.",0
"Very good , updated my phone and works fine again",1
Its fine for the most part. Some songs are there but won't play. Very intrusive ads during podcasts(pretty sure i have a paid subscription. Not easy to skip ads either. Gives a platform to people spreading misinformation during a global health crisis.,0
"Too many pop ups, adverts ever 3 songs for the free version and they're the same adverts. YouTube isn't this bad!",0
Plays songs you chose to hide. Insane amount of ads. Plays the same songs over and over even when you have recommendations turned on. I'm switching to Pandora,0
Best streaming service app ever!,1
It's pretty good there's so many K-pop songs and pop songs so yep i love this app <3,1
It's a really good app I found songs I forgot about,1
I absolutely love listening to all my podcasts on spotify,1
It's really good it better than Pandora but it's hard with the shuffle stuff beside that it's great,1
This app isn't good sometimes it works and then sometimes it won't I listen to music and it stops automatically and doesn't let me listen to music 1 star.,0
I love Spotify because it has my favorite song ....,1
The best music streaming app,1
The best without ads I mean with and without the best,1
"Recommendation feature is bothersome. If I want a song in my playlist, I will put it in. I'm having to repeatedly hide songs I don't like. Really bad feature.",0
"Spotify you need to sort this out! Seems I'm having the same issue as everyone else in the last few months. Stops playing randomly, does not show the media control bar and keeps stopping. I've been updating the app at least once a week at this point but still continuously have to close it. Really not good enough for a service I am paying for and is used daily.",0
"It's not fixing the issue related Lisa, Everytime her account get hacked , even after request and mass mailing to Spotify, still no response Very very very poor app",0
"All my favourite songs, ranging from country to slow rock to musicals and more, at my finger tips!",1
"SPOTIFY is okay but sometimes it can be difficult to use. I have accumulated over 53,000 songs in my LIKED Playlist and SPOTIFY can't randomize such a large list. SPOTIFY does not have a proper solution to the problem. I want to empty the entire list without having to cancel the entire account in order to start over. Solve my problem, SPOTIFY, and maybe I will consider upgrading your app to 5 stars. Offer an account upgrade giving users like more me ways to manage their music, podcasts, etc.",0
What happened? The app is so incredibly glitchy. It won't show up on my phone's lock screen anymore ever. Constant restarts to play music. Premium might not be worth all the hassle to play my music and podcasts.,0
"What the is happening with this app???!!!?? The songs are playing very very half like what is going on??!!! You literally need to put shuffle on that I don't want too.. I'm just getting so angry I also updated it but still nothing happened??!!?,ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡This app has become very disgusting cuz now I can't play my favourite part of the song nor listen to it easily F- Spotify you better reply Plz plz fixx this",0
"Horrible creators. The old interface was amazing, and it downgraded so much because of the creators' incompentence and greedines. Want to listen to a song? You can't. Wait for 100 songs to play before you get to it. Have 50 ads in between too. DON'T download this garbage. The only thing it's good for is being compared to better music apps. I'd give it a 0/10 if I could.",0
"Recent change in quality. Had it for over 3 yrs with no problem then changed phone and new upload. App would crash, Now playing button disappeared. Very frustrating experience. This stopped in last few days. Hoping the worst is over with. Outside of this, absolutely love spotify. This is one app, I do not want to live without.",0
"update: for some reason the option to block accounts isnt there anymore so thats a bummer. Im constantly paranoid that my account will be found by the people i dont want finding it. So that sucks :/ hopefully the app will still have the option to have private playlists remains. other than not being able to block profiles atm, the app works pretty well most of the time. i hardly have any issues",0
"I don't know why would anyone without a subscription would download the version for mobile. It's absolutely fill to the brim with ads, it's impossible to use playlists and it feels literally designed to NOT be used without a subscription. The aggressive marketing is the core driven of the mobile version and a slap to the face for any user. This is one of the many good reasons that keep me from buying a subscription or supporting Spotify in any way. Don't install it.",0
"Exactly what I needed, awesome stuff.",1
Sound cloud is better than ads free  once try and say thanks again,1
Yall should do a karaoke feature on the app... yall already have most song lyrics built in....ijs it would be cool ðŸ˜Ž,0
I started using Spotify over 10 years ago. Still love it and it keeps getting better.,1
Your better off listening to music on YouTube because then at least you may actually be able to pick what song you want to play on a playlist instead of it forceing it to being random every time and sometimes it'll play stuff that's not even on your playlist and the only way to skip it is to have premium or use one of your six skips for the day. The only reason I'm keeping it is to keep track of which songs I actually like so that way I can listen to them on YouTube. would not use again,0
"Not all songs I like can be found on spotify, like live versions, two examples: live version of ChloeXHalle ungodly hour, or Mumford and sons the enemy. Sometimes the music wont play the downloads offline. The app bothered me to rate, so here you are.",0
Best music appreciation. No 1 music app.ðŸ‘,1
Very fun and good app for music.,1
Thanks to Team Very best and vast collection of old and new songs super,1
"Worst of all, you tap on a song another song plays.",0
"Very nice app for who want to Listen music. Must use this wonderfull app for Listening the music by Name, Musician, Album, or Movie. Easy search feature and create the playlist.",1
Recently the app has been nigh unusable. Music stuttering or crashing whenever I decide to unlock my phone. Auto playing through the phone speaker when disconnecting from a Bluetooth device. Half the time opening the app there are no play controls visible even though music is playing and it will need a full restart to get the controls back.,0
Good,1
"I used to love this app, hence buying premium, but since the newest Android update after locking my phone spotify will stop playing after a minute. This has never happened before and I'm extremely disappointed. If it doesn't get fixed soon I'll most likely stop paying for premium since I can't use it like I normally would.",0
dudr why now can't play short music during i add a song?,0
Best variety of good musicians... I'm overwhelmed with this experience that I choose to rate at 5 stars... Very Satisfied...,1
"Used to be good, recent release is a buggy mess.",0
Good,1
"They ""shuffle in"" too much of what they want you to hear",0
"Fix the damn bugs. For the past two years the app gives me either ""no internet error"", takes 2 min to load content or crashes upon startup. What am I paying the subscription for? ðŸ˜¡",0
"As if the app wasn't bad enough they have now taken away the feature of previewing songs before you add them to a playlist, this ruins the reach of their artist and the discovery of their audience. Horrible app that makes foolish decisions honestly not worth getting anymore.",0
I like the app it's good my problem is i hate it when i play my favorites which is i can't because they PLAY FIRST the songs i didn't mark favorite on it (excuse my grammar) please don't do that what i marked is what i listen not what you want play on my device!!!!,0
"Full of ads. I think this app is for premium users only. Now a days , It show me two ads at every 2 or 3 songs , that's is so irritating . Few day ago it show me one ad at every 30 minutes but now ads frequency has been increased . ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž *****We can't delete the history",0
Absolutely trash app. Episodes stop during play and read as finished. Hard to navigate. Loading animation on episodes I downloaded. Amateurish problems. Refuse to pay for this anymore.,0
"I love the app, I use it everyday. And I love the lyrics update, tho I heard that some other people don't have it and they really want it, so thats sad.",1
Terrible..its hard now to play song that i want..must hear many songs before the song that i want..very-very dissapointed,0
"There are albums, songs that are still not available here. But its all good. There is still room for improvement.",0
I love Spotify it plays really good music,1
Best app to sync our mind and heart with music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ ðŸ˜Œ â¤ ðŸ™Œ ðŸ’•,1
"It was a superb app a few years ago. No keep stopping playing music (even when good reception), struggle to control other devices, you can't adjust volume on other device, the widget doesn't work on Samsung. While on Android Auto the app keep crushing. Do not recomend.",0
"Fix this ""no internet connection"" rubbish..Or i'ld have cancel my subscription and switch to another music app that won't give me troubles...Its becoming annoying! i uninstalled and installed..Now i can't even log in to my account anymore..keeps showing ""you're offline"" ""check your connection and try again""..",0
"I love the song,and ilike most sporty to support,the old music ,and our favorite singers,thank you so much,,sporty,,,",1
"Like everyone else, my app plays without a playbar, making it useless. Spotify code scan ads still work flawlessly of course. I think Spotify has run its course. Looking for that new thing.",1
I am rating this app 1 star because Spotify removed a very important feature i.e. removing the recently played. That feature was very much needed because you might accidentally play something you didn't mean to,0
"Hi, @Spotify @SpotifyCares We noticed that the song 'MONEY' by LISA on some of your playlists has been replaced with an unauthorized song with an identical name. Hope you fix this immediately. Would u mind giving us some advice please @AskSpotifyStars",0
Very wonderful app... U can hear all kinds of language songs here.... Really loved it ðŸ¤©,1
"The share links do not always take me to a song directly, just the artist page when others send specific song sharing links.",0
"Best music app out there. Can download to my own library. Save favs, even link with other apps like Google maps. A 5 star app all day!",1
"Spotify is a great app for music and also podcasts, there are so many educational podcasts, especially Joe Rogan. He is not spreading misinformation he is simply having conversations. Because he asked a question and his guest answers doesn't mean it's misinformation. If people have a problem with Joe Rogan that's ridiculous they should go after his guests that are spreading information/misinformation? Don't get rid of Joe Rogan!!!",1
"Hi. Well done with the app.. It's a good one. Please, could the queue system be more stable? Once a song on the queue plays, it disappears from the queue. Also, can there be a ""Play Next"" option on Spotify?",0
Thank you for not sensoring everything Spotify!,1
"I have only just learnt of the misinformation that spotify allows to be spread by Rogan (apologies, I know the issues spotify has socially speaking aren't new, I'm a slow learner). Absolutely unacceptable. Unsubscribed and deleted.",0
"The app constantly stops during play. The user interface is not designed very well, from the swiping that advances to the next podcast, to the fact that I cannot organize my podcasts. If it wasn't for Joe Rogan only being on Spotify, I'd use another podcast app.",0
App isn't working.I uninstalled and installed the app but can't login.songs just play for 9 second and app stops working.,0
"The last update has made this app garbage. It kind of just plays what it wants to now, and any queue you have set up doesn't matter anymore. Seriously considering canceling subscription and going elsewhere.",0
Best aap for music it has a variety of Playlist made on our listening songs and podcast and every artist Playlist is best I low this aap,0
"I'd rate it 5 stars if it had a shuffle option. Regardless of what elitist Adele says, we average listeners don't particularly want to ""tell a stories"" with our playlists. We want the option to enjoy random music.",0
The best music platform available!,1
Currently bugged on many flagship phones including Pixels and S22 series devices. Playback controls disappear after a few minutes and you must relaunch the app in order to control anything related to playback.,0
"Good app if you have premium. If you can't afford premium, probably just get sound cloud.",1
At some point this app itself turned to junk. Playbars dissappear so you can't control what's playing. Shows the wrong media in now playing. Just runs horribly. Hopefully a company this size puts some money into fixing it eventually,0
"This app is soo goodd i can listen to fav songs, and im not gonna find or download it in google or anything, i can just find it in spotifyðŸ¤ðŸ§¡ðŸ”¥",0
Android user: the new update SUCKS. The play bar is gone in the app and on my overhead menu. This makes is REALLY annoying to use,0
In this app there is all songs which is currently available and unavailable so plz try it.,0
Idk why I'm paying $11 a month for an app that crashes at least 3 times a day. At this point I'd rather deal with youtube ads than keep putting up w spotify,0
1 star for not able to see my friends activity. Earlier it was ok but after few updates can't see friends activity. Don't give lecture on setting and stuff. Thanks,1
"preview songs has been deprecated, makes it quite difficult to make new playlists and explore new songs.",0
4 stars because I haven't used for a month yet... Have had no ad interruptions yet... Really enjoying this app. It might deserve 5 stars.,1
Really loving the all current and classic hits.,1
The free app version of this is absolute dog water I do not recommend... I've been listening to ads more than I've been listening to music,0
Optimum sound quality.,1
It cool,1
I wish I could somehow see what songs I've heard before. I'm going through a 69 hour playlist and it's hard to keep track of my place in the playlist and on random setting I'll never know if I heard all the songs. Or sometimes I don't remember if I've heard a playlist or album before or just parts of it.,0
I give this app 0 star but there is always a chance so try to develop this app. This is just unacceptable u can even play ur fav music again like u have yo wait 24 hour like bruh :/ btw i am not trying to spread negativity i am just being honest and that is just the truth ðŸ’¯ðŸ˜Œ the creator of this app if u are seening this i just wanna say fix ur app.,0
"Overall is decent. App has the capability of downloading podcasts and songs for offline listening, but the downloads section won't appear if offline. What is the point of downloading a podcast if I'm unable to access it outside of internet access?",0
Is very good but they have a choose the permit into......,1
I really like it I just hate that I can't find out how to delete podcasts on it,1
"So basically, The app is pretty good rn. But I made 200+ playlists and some of my playlists that I made in the past are gone. So that's why 4 stars. But I hope other people could see my playlists. Spotify : mubasshiramahmood1_ Thank you.",0
"Guys, fix your s**t, I'm a premium user for years now, and day by day the app gets buggier and you keep changing the interface (example: I can't find the made for you lists). App keeps playing a certain number of tracks from a list (example, plays five tracks from a list, and starts over with the same tracks without playing the rest of tracks on the list). Another issue is controls disappear sometimes, and I have to close the app and reopen it. Very disappointed, considering other streaming apps",0
What the hell is wrong with this app I am trying to play the songs I want and it takes me to a whole different genre and wont let me do what I want how do you expect to get people to like your app when you cant even listen to what you want. Worst app ever,1
"Spotify forces you to pay by restricting you even the most necessary functions in a music player, you can't even do repeat and can only do LIMITED skips! You're shoved of songs you don't know after you play your song, and you can't play the specific song you wanted once you make your own playlist (hence: shuffle is the only option) Ads are a thing but that, I don't mind at all. Desktop was so much better in this, no wonder some people even prefer using pirated stuff, how would I pay when the free version isn't even hitting satisfactory?",0
The best music streaming app,1
Stupid adverts when trying to listen to music,0
Spotify is a great app to listen to whatever music you want to make your own playlist of find others like yours or find something completly new by far the best Music app,1
It fun cool and add more songs on Spotify.,1
"It doesnt let me play the song i want , it just shuffles to a diffrent sobg please change this.",0
"Great for the most part, but when attempting to sync with other devices - be that a computer, smart home device or similar the interface both lags and sometimes stops working altogether on the mobile app - requiring to force restart the mobile app to get it to re-sync.",0
I really like this app I can find music I haven't heard in decades man I can listen for hours thanks for having a damn good app,1
Hate it when i go play a song and it's non playable on one of my play list but not on another.. scratching my head and doing some swearing. Otherwise it's good. Prices go up and I don't get no notification that it is until you take it out of my account..,0
"Spotify sucks, for so many reasons. But for consumers, it sucks because the shuffle mode doesn't actually shuffle anything. It just chooses songs you've heard a million times, or songs that are most popular. They have no plans to fix this issue. I wish I could give you 0 stars.",0
Good,1
Really defeats the purpose of Spotify if yo unable us to hear bit of the song before adding it to our playlist :/,0
Very good aaitom,1
the new update is the ugliest thing I've ever seen and I'm genuinely thinking about switching to another app cause this update was the worst thing to ever happen to Spotify,0
Daily mixes don't refresh and too many commercials on the mobile app.,0
Shuffle function just repeats the songs in the playlist ðŸ™„. Please fix.,0
Most useful app..ðŸ‘we can listen whatever we want to listen...all types of songs available in this app..fabulous ðŸ‘â¤,1
Love spotify great music app in world,1
"bad software quality. slow, all around buggy, laggy, inconsistent, bloated. Crowded UI, with important features hidden several (laggy) clicks away. why does my music streaming app come with COVID info?!",0
"Having issues with the app . It automatically open in my notification tab which i can not get rid off,. Also sometimes it fails to launch and i had to reinstall it sevral times please look into it",0
"'Hey slow down you have only 6 in one hour"" is rude. I should not receive that when I have not subscribed",0
I changed my long time five star review to one star because Spotify on Samsung is terrible. The update causes it stop working constantly. This review is from a premium user. Maybe it was five star before because I had an iPhone and spotify didn't constantly stop working. Now I have to force stop it in my phone settings anytime I want it to work properly. Whoever made this update really messed up. I hope you guys take these 1 star reviews in consideration because spotify used to be good.,0
"Very slow after latest update. Often missing the bar at the bottom showing me current song. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""",0
"This app is great, it has (almost) every song I really enjoy. Def a 5 star rating",1
I wanted to start from the beginning of my playlist and won't let me. It let me before the update now it won't.,1
Great can find all kinds of old songs,1
"There's so many ads now, AND I have to shuffle through my playlist and just to listen to the song I want. I know you need money and stuff, but this has just crossed the line.",0
Playbar disappears on regular basis. Should be fixed.,0
I now can't pause music or podcasts. I don't know if there has been recent update but this has been happening since yesterday. I uninstalled the app yesterday then reinstalled this morning. Iwas working fine until now. Won't use app again. This is a pain in the neck.,0
Spotify only Play adds,0
So Good ,1
Good Experience,1
Love the variety of my favorite tracks,1
Im generally satisfied with my experience with Spotify other than the random times the app closes sometimes I can go 10 or so songs before the app randomly closes,1
Good,1
This app is very very nice Every song is available,1
Excellent app,1
"I have been using this app for my music, and I LOVE it. The only thing I would highly encourage, and recommend happening is making a way for the premium version to be able to make payments possible to happen through Google Play balance. I'm not sure if I'm the only one that feels this way, but it'd be a lot safer instead of having to use a debit/credit card or even using a PayPal account for payment. I hope consideration, and making this happen will be granted too one day. Thank you.",0
It can create playlist and add downloaded songs to playlists and there is a button where you get free premium no credit card needed for 4 months,0
Best app for streaming the latest music hands down. If you have Spotify Duo you & your parter can create your own accounts & playlist for one small price. I absolutely love Spotify. Highly recommended.,1
"I primarily listen to podcast and there's such a wide variety, I love it.",1
"Playlist feels stale on free mode,even after accepting the fact that it comes with alot of adverts....it should be refreshed more often than not",0
Great but needs some fixing up and should stop using so much data,0
1 Music to listen anywhere,1
"It's been going for months now, why does this app always change the settings of my storage from external SD card to phone storage. The downloaded songs are eating up my phone storage space, while I have an so much free space on my external SD card. And it takes a long time to transfer the downloaded songs back to external SD from phone storage, it's faster to uninstall the app and download the tunes again. Please fix.",0
"if you're a music lover , this is all you need and of you're not one just install , you will become one. just like me.",1
"I cant stop it automatically opening and playing in my car via BT. It's painful, the settings in app don't work.",0
i have a premium account on Spotify and i did all the updates but i still don't have the lyrics,0
Ecstatic ,1
it's so endearing without adsðŸ¥²ðŸ˜Œ,1
Onbording is very bad user experience. Not able to login even after successful registration. Uninstalling the app as not able to use it,0
I like it. But it doesn't have enough songs,0
Love that my Playlists are not constantly interrupted like on youtube,1
"Very recently started using this app, and I find the mix and variety excellent. Keep it up on your end, and I will continue using this app on my end. ðŸ‘",1
"They just say listen add free songs for 30 mins, but after 1/2 songs, when I change the song, advertisements comes.",0
"I personally think it's good, works well and has a wide range of music and podcasts. Premium is great for on the go without draining your data.",1
Not work in my mobile properly just useless,0
Horrible No Network message when I just downloaded the app,0
Spotify is the best app i ever used i felt that spotify is connect with my soul and heart what ever my mood is spotify play that type of songs for meðŸ˜ i love spotifyâ¤,1
"A lot of ads come in this, after every two songs the add comes, please remove the add.",0
This app is amazing I love it so much and definitely recommend it,1
GREAT,1
I love that Spotify is absolutely against any censorship of important information. Thank you for allowing people to hear it.,1
Awesome except the ads,1
"why my phone always restart, when i try to open this app.",0
"Nice app I guess but... I Usually Listen to this podcast called ""Spooky Korean tales"" but ever since I've paid premium i cant listen to it the play button wont work but it does for other podcasts and songs",1
"Highly unresponsive after you open Spotify from overview press at bottom screen. You have to either shut it down and launch it again or wait for it to load for almost 15 seconds, then the app wakes up and starts running. Very annoying and have to press almost 5 or 6 times to play a song.",0
I can't listen to the songs I want. With the new update they decide what songs you listen to.,0
Good but without premium there is a lot of ads and I can't listen to the song I want,1
I like it for the most part but one song I haven't been able to get went I find it,1
My go to! Even the updates and small changes over the years has made it better,1
"Longtime premium user here - this is now a poorly designed app. Podcasts are always above all the music/playlists when you open the app, REQUIRING scrolling before seeing any music on a horizontal screen. Offline mode only works occasionally. Playlists often don't synchronize between devices. Recommendations are too sensitive when a family member listens music you don't like (who doesn't want more Baby Shark?). Private session is inconveniently located in the disorganized menu when needed.",0
We should be able to filter out or set preference for certain languages. Just because I listen to music in one foreign language does not mean i will understand or enjoy music in languages of neighboring countries. Also we should have control over our main dashboard. I listen to that podcast once and I'm not interested in similar ones. The algorithm assumes incorrectly 99% of the time.,0
Excellent app with out any disturbances,1
I like spotify but on mobile is HARD!! Can you please make it easier to use on mobile? Thanks.,0
Hate you can't always rewind or skip besides that the app is great,1
"I know y'all need the money, but the new update is just too much. I can not see the songs I'm trying to listen to, neither in my own playlists nor in anyone else's. It's really irritating. But what's worse, is the 'shuffle' forced feature. I'll try listen to a specific song, not from any playlist. And it just starts playing some similar song. And I can not see when the song that I wanted to listen to will play, because oh - I can not see the song list. Bout to uninstall the app tbh.",0
Best app for listening to music and podcast.,1
App is good overall but the play bar keeps disappearing which means I have no control over what's playing...almost unusable at times,0
I only have Spotify to watch the Joe Rogan Experience. Worth every penny for that,0
Decent stuff but it's a poorly done app for it's size and all the people using it. Glitchy. Also spotify is pretty bad at recommending music. At leasr pandora could recommend relevant music. I've been on spotify for years. It still struggles so hard. It's okay at best. A lot could be fixed.,0
Congrats for 1,1
Control bar disappears and audio stops/glitches. Pointless having app so will be cancelling premium membership.,0
A little hard to navigate at first but once you figure it out it's ok.,1
Mere saare favorite song isme hai so thank you so much for made this aap and isliye 5 stars haqdar hai,1
I shouldn't need to listen to 30 ads in a row just so I can listen to 8 minutes worth of music.,0
"Don't get me wrong I love Spotify but this new update sucks I can't even play my list in order and I can't play a song separately and I cant stop playing the song, if I am just being dumb and just don't know how to please tell me how but still the new updates suck why can't we go back to the old Spotify?And the ads are just a big no I know you need money but still we are trying to listen to music or podcasts not listen to some stupid ad. And the ""6 skips per hour"" WTH!? it's just getting worse.",0
Very good app for music ....ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
Update is buggy play button is sometimes not showing.,0
"Spotify is brilliant music app a massive selection of music genres, and Spotify free too, receive emails every week on new releases. Not pricey either but I would like to have high res audio quality but other than that I would recommend Spotify as you have the free option and pay option my kids love Spotify ðŸ˜ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ªâ¤ï¸",1
Playback doesnt show/disappears after a few songs. Randomly pauses music.,0
Please allow us to select multiple songs at a time and add them to a Playlist. It's kinda annoying having to select each song individually to add them to a Playlist. Also have a library for all downloaded songs different from liked songs,0
Just ads. But song collection is great,1
Pay for the family account and still only one person can use it.... pointless and waste of money And it has a mind of its own. Works on its own accord.. apple music is cheaper and you get a family package!,0
"This app is great. But I have a problem I can't play songs from my playlist cuz whenever I press shuffle play it just gives me random songs that I don't even like or know the language, and when ever I try to press on an actual song in the play list it just plays like 10 seconds of it from a random part but it won't play the actual song I wanna listen to so please fix it cuz it's frustrating",0
Absolutely the best experience app when I'm facing down mood.Through any song by using it without any charge,1
The recent updates has made the app worse by now just hanging on the splash screen. I don't pay a family plan for a non working app. Also the new UI is horrible.,0
"I love the way you put different Playlist s together for me,I know that I'm going to always have good music to listen to, Thanks for the great music.",1
"I chose student plan for premium, after entering the details I got ""verification complete"" ,nothing further. My plan did not changed, still ""free"" , after I tried to do verification again I get the phrase "" you already redeemed this offer , AND I'M STILL WITH FREE PLAN...",0
Listening songs is my hobby . And spotify helps me Thank you so much,1
"Music keeps stopping mid song, mid play list. Please fix. Still very buggy. Podcasts play in weird orders, display on the screen does not reflect what's playing.",0
"I've used Spotify for many years now, and I love it! I've had premium for a while, and I just went up to duo actually. It's going really well. There's only 1 suggestion I could make, and that's to please add in a feature that allows people to sort playlists into different groups that way I can see different groups of playlists and choose instead of all 36 of them at once. But it's a very good app!",1
This app won't let me log back in. Tgis and the spotify for artists app. I'm not sure what to do,0
Best app for music and podcasts.,1
"It seems I can barely listen to my music now. I've been counting and I get 5-7 ads during the ad breaks. I know you have to pay to get rid of the ads, but having this many is ridiculous.",0
"Every time I have tried to open, it doesn't load, and instead just shows the logo. I'll improve rating if it is fixed.",0
"Always dependable music, Spotify is always there keeping you entertained.",1
I love it only complaint is you can't preview the song anymore and can you add a way to sort tge artist out by name in the order you have it in please that would up it to a 5star,1
Wow SizzLing HOT and Oozing with GLAMOROUS ELEGANT SEDUCTIVE SEX AppeaL TROPHY  GIRLFRIEND just Like Me DeLicious ,1
Spotify has stopped working on my phone. It wont load at all.,0
"I usually don't rate apps 1* just because of a minor annoyance but this time I'm making an exception since the annoyance has grown to a real pet peeve. Why on earth would you trigger the ""Going for a drive"" notification as alerting notification every time I set foot in my car, and not even give me the option to disable it?",0
Latest update is really buggy on Android. It keeps disconnecting and it doesnt show on a locked screen quite often. Spotify is the best music streaming app out there,1
Love them!!! They are one of the best music and podcast apps out there!!,1
Absolutely love Spotify! The algorithm has introduced me to new bands and very rarely does it play a song I dislike. Would absolutely recommend getting.,1
Glitches have been unbearable in the past few weeks other than that I think that Spotify is still the best streaming service that would deserve a 5 star rating,1
I love this app,1
"Unuseable in any way on the free version due to ads and no playlist control. Still unuseable for podcasts, even on the paid version, due to glitchy episode lists and choppy, fragmented audio when downloading episodes. Downloaded tracks glitch when going in and out of wifi range or cell service areas, and sometimes for no reason at all. Reinstalling the app temporarily fixes some problems. One star for great selection I guess.",0
Yes I like to know why my music from here ain't hitting my beats on my headphones,0
Just one thing WHY ADD SONGS TO A PLAYLIST LIKE I CAN'T REMOVE THEM AND I JUST HAVE TO LISTEN TO SONGS I DON'T LIKE,0
"Issues with pause and skip buttons disappearing in the tool bar, constant having to restart the app. Not worth the price I'm paying, have cancelled for now until sorted.",0
"Nice but really need to find a research system for the search. Use the search to find the songs you don't have then set a reminder to the subscriber that you found the song and have it ready for their Playlist..vintage classic, real good oldies, certain unplayable hits that can only be played in youtube..YouTube... have extra volume sets to enhanced loudness to certain cars...",0
"Lacks a lot of features that amazon music provides, doesnt allow you to download individual songs in an efficient manner. Also is a MASSIVE pain to remove podcasts you've already listened to from the ""my episodes"" playlist unless you really stay on top of it, removing them as soon as theyre over.",0
Everything you want to hear every artist and every emotion is right here.,1
Best music library ever! I love it!,1
"I have had Spotify for years...then as my children grew, I took the family package. We absolutely LOVE Spotify. We each use it on a daily basis. Music is a must in our home and to have absolutely everything under the shining sun, at the touch of a button...just brilliant! The app is easy to navigate and I love how the majority of the songs have the lyrics below. Quite honestly, if I had to, i'd give up any other luxury before even contemplating giving up Spotify.",1
"I went to play one song, and multiple somgs played. Most of them were not by the artist I was looking for. I went to skip to the song and ran out of skips. The song I wanted wasn't played. Almost deleted the app Edit: I should be able to turn of the setting.",0
I can't play a specific song that I want. A different song starts everytime.,0
"This ""going for a drive"" notification that you can't turn off is the stupidest thing ever put on an app. Get notifications everytime my phone Bluetooth connects. If I want to listen to Spotify I'll open the app.",0
It is the app to only listen to ads not music so prefer using its mod apk which I currently use which is the best with out paying a single penny,1
Advertisments are repetitive,0
"So far, so good. The variety of music available for my tastes (Christian Music) is eclectic and voluminous.",1
I enjoy my summer vibe ðŸŽ¶ all the time. I don't have no ads.,1
"So in 2020i think i installed spotify and it was awesome great experience, but now every time I wanna listen to a song its says advertising or whatever, it just keeps going on with the advertising thing, am I doing some thing wrongs here?? I really dont know it hard to use it beacause of that?",0
Apparently now my Spotify doesn't work well after the Android 11 update. It seems to not play my downloaded music at all. Only the not downloaded music can be played. What's the point of downloading music if you can't listen to it at all? Please fix this problem Spotify.(New update: now the player icon disappears after sometime using the app. I have to restart the app everytime it does that. What is seriously wrong with the software team?),0
Best music streaming venue!,1
"Horrible service. Spotify hijacked my phone and now all saved audio files will only play through Spotify. Worked for 2 hours with Listya H. On chat to fix it. When they could not, they disconnected from the Chat. 2 hours wasted!",0
It's so cool literally any song you want too listen u can it's just like heaven,1
Trash. No option to turn off suffle and will never play the selected song. Plus d espite turning off the setting it continues to play suggested songs when I want to listen to a playlist or just want to listen to a song. Absolute garbage,0
Stops playing by itself. Control disappears. Glitchy. Please fix today.,0
"Spotify is a great comfort zone of music. There's all kinds of audios, not only music. There's religious recitations such as Qur'an, there's rain sounds, relaxing music and different types of ASMR. I personally recommend Spotify. Plus, the ""No ads"" feature isn't very expensive. It's close to a dollar.",1
"The app is great, but the automix of smooth transitions between songs is terrible especially when listening to amapiano songs on my own playlist. It could have been better if the current song is about to end, it starts fading, then the next song comes on smoothly. Wish it can do better.",0
"This app is always glitching and it used to play while I'm on other apps but, its been glitching and not loading much , that might be Internet but everytime I play a song off of my PLAYLIST it usually loads anytime but it doesn't. Everytime I search a song, that I don't have on any of my playlists it will not play the song, example:I searched worst behavior by Ariana Grande and it played the song no tears left to cry by Ariana Grande. You need to update that, I can't listen to what I want",0
I rated it this because I didn't like that they add songs for you. Is it possible that they put an option if someone would like them to add a song.,0
Great app. They have every single song that I wish to listen,1
Absolutely LOVE Spotify and I'm glad to have started this service as my go to music playing...Five stars all day from me,1
Bruh After this update i cant even play the songs that i want it just shuffles it and u cant even disable the shuffle because it does not exist anymore like what kind of music app doesn't have a shuffle disable and it just pick a random music sometimes and not on your liked songs and the worst part is you can only skip 6 times in 6 hours like bruh i used to love this app but after the update its dead for me i regret updating the app i should have not updated it when its not even forcing me pfttt,0
"Not All music can be played, and they not update all the music everyday.",0
"I understand that commercials pay for us to have the app for free, but 4 in a row seems excessive.",0
"Updated to 4 stars. Would be 5, except it still shuts down unexpectedly. Maybe next time. ðŸ‘",0
"Really good to use, I've been using Spotify a lot in the last 2Â½ years, Haven't had any issues with it (besides losing signal every now and then when in the car - as a passenger)",0
The current update seems to have broken the app by making the Now Playing bar disappear at random.,0
App never works only plays 10 seconds of the song then freezes even when I'm on wifi I can't believe I paid money for this.,0
I would rate it a five but because of the adds being so long I give it a four,0
Ad ad ad its like listening Spotify just for ad that's all why the hell are you giving songs too just say to pay song for listening song instead of harrassing so much every time first ad then the song it's not app to listen songs it's only for listening ad that's it never ever download the app install you tube music instead its good hundred time than this worst app you just want to make money thats it everyone will leave this app because of your worst policy I am damn sure I will never recommend,0
"It keeps closing when i press play. Very disappointed. Tried everything from reinstalling to signing out, didn't help .",0
It contains too much ads... Sometimes it causes headache... That's why I ranked it 1/5...,0
The music is amazing and never glitches and also I love the 3d art you guys added,1
Was great. Now has a bug where the player won't come up. Very frustrating,0
"Wish there was a cheaper option.$9.99 a month just to be able to skip more, replay, and skip backwards is ridiculous.",0
Been buggy af lately.. not showing current song playing.. randomly closing.. trouble loading stuff etc.. and ANDROID STILL DOESNT HAVE SWIPE TO ADD TO QUEUE that's messed up.,0
I love this app ,1
Wonderful app - well designed and a joy to use.,1
"Overall I Love spotify, for the quality and options and so on and finally adding lyrics. Although I wish sometimes my downloaded playlists would lose downloads. A good feature to add on to downloads, that it also downloads the lyrics so you don't have to be online to see them, even with horrible reception areas.",1
Latest update makes spotify go mute when we skip a song. Please fix it,0
I love the song recommendationâ™¡â™¡,1
"The app wont load. Uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted phone, freezes at logo screen. I pay for this and cant access ANY of my music. That unsubscribe button is looking very tempting..",0
"I think Spotify is the best music app. It's not perfect though, the UI still feels choppy and laggy sometimes, the songs aren't that highest quality that we assume they are. And the songs queue interface instill bad. But apart from that, Spotify's algorithm is just the industry leading. I mean I just cannot use any other music streaming service to listen and explore music at the same time. And some Spotify exclusive podcasts.",0
Very good app...... This app is good for me while doing some work.... Good songs collection,1
Nice ,1
Its just the pest you can listen to songs offline,0
I like the previous interface it's easy to listen to music. now I can't even choose what i like please bring back the old interface.,0
"Current version is terrible. I can not use the app w/o restarting it every time I open the phone... App constantly crushes, current song panel either shows wrong song and is unresponsive or does not show at all. Either you fired your QA team or forgot to update to Android12.",0
"Everything is good, except Tamil song lyrics! Its horrible to even readout manðŸ˜‚",1
"As far as music apps are, this is my favorite.",1
Love listening to my Spotify. Any place anytime. Even with commercials,1
"one word, Fantastic.",1
So much of adds Cant listen songs peacefully Best thing is i can listen to bts songs,1
Spotify no problem. Really Love this app,1
Not to bad premium is overpriced and no deal for students in Australia at high school.,0
I'm starting to hate Spotify you can only listen to like 2 of your songs unless you skip and then you get like 10 ads it's really annoying,0
"I only listen to some oldies and soundtrack, don't feel like signing up yet.",0
Super,1
I love this app,1
Its very good but maybe make unpaid better. I have premium and its great so maybe make unpaid a little like premium please.,0
Needs to be able to skip more songs,0
"Just a wonderful app to store music, stream live and plus more! I highly recommend it if you are wanting to not only get a great exercise in but experience good music with all your downloaded music you pick and choose from!",1
Spotify is one of the greats of all time.,1
It's perfect on my watch Samsung Galaxy watch for classic,1
"Lately when I have had music playing, it won't show in my notification bar so I can't switch the song. When I go into the app it shows I've got nothing playing even when I do.",0
It would be good if there is a download option to listen offline,0
"This is a wonderful app, no Doubt .I recommend it for everyone of any age. The only thing you can't download from it.",1
App is nice but advertisement should be reduced,0
I cant listen to music anymore without premium. Om moving back to soundcloud.,0
"It's really been an awesome experience, it's so sooo nostalgic, my oldies playlist on Spotify takes me back to my Secondary School & University days. I love the feeling. Thanks Spotify.",1
"In the recent update some changes were made. Now I quite often face a disappearing of player on the bottom of the screen with a song name. My phone is HUAWEI P20 Pro, premium subscription",0
I can watch every podcast but dj akademiks seems kinda weird and seems to be done on purpose!,0
Not working properly,0
"Spotify is different, it's the better differents.",0
I literally listen to music all day I don't watch television and I'm hooked on Spotify right now,1
It is a great app Very user friendly,1
I don't understand what's wrong. I just wanna listen to one playlist but it keeps shuffling n I don't want dat. It's really getting frustrating,0
There is no scroll bar for fast scrolling in liked songs . I am going to cance l my subscription because of this .I have 4000 songs in Library how am I suppose to scroll all these songs,0
"Possibly the most counter intuitive and useless ""user interface"" I have seen on an app. From colour scheme to positioning of icons it is all wrong.",0
"It used to be really good, but since the update and the Samsung update it stopped working. It now doesn't leg me play a single song or even open it. Playlists just say return to home screen...",0
It is April 2022 and it still has the same problems as last year. What is the use of offline downloads if you can not access them when you're offline? Why am I still getting ads even though I'm a premium subscriber? How is it you can pay Joe Rogan 100 million dollars but refuse to fix this buggy app? Does it take the another class action lawsuit for you to act and do your job?,0
"Everything is good in this app... But there should be Suggestions option for hit and good music of any time, according to play preference of the users...",1
"Great audio , searching for for the music",1
The play and pause button are not coming on.,0
"Don't know what's with the Spotify App recently. I am a premium account user. Used to be my favorite go to but the shear number of bugs in recent months is insane for a streaming service I'm paying for monthly. App randomly closing itself, music not shutting off when App closes, freezing and not loading the music control section...",0
"If i could give 0 i would.the app has started playing random songs on my liked playlist.if i wanted to listen to random songs, id get the radio on. Just let me listen to MY OWN songs. Lots of the songs it plays are inappropriate as well. Terrible.One of the songs mainly consisted of swear words. I dont want to listen to an artist who keeps swearing at me. Its foul and not appropriate.Espescially if i play it in the car where there are children under 12 with me. I dont want them listening to that",0
System keeps shutting down when trying to play a song..,0
I love it but the only thing holding me back from giving this a 5 star is the car UI now being a premium option.,0
I didn't realize this was a platform for misinformation. Not renewing my subscription.,0
I hate how I can't just go down the line and listen to my music.but everything else is amazing,1
I HATE THIS APP if you install it after reading this then youll end up some one like me. So i put a name of a song in and then it gave a different song with diffrent singer and all time I tried to skip it to the next either to or fro but was useless.Im SPEECHLESS. By the way not to be unfair the only 1 good thing out of 300 trillion is that you still look at the lyrics and if you go out of the app you still can hear it if your not using an app or game that has sounds. If ads come you cant hear!,0
Lots of bugs in the latest version,0
Bro it never did this and now after every single song it plays an ad tf is that about like what,0
Good however introducing dolby and lossless streaming will be better,0
"Transport you different time-in, good app",1
Love it easy and keeping up with music bomb,1
Enjoying the music I loved from my teenage years....and a lot more! Great choices and great sound. Love it! â¤,1
"App constantly plays the same songs regardless of using shuffle. For example, today while not driving the app is playing all the songs it played yesterday while driving. Sucks.",0
"Spotify can go eff itself! Won't let me sign back in! Won't let me play music off line even though I paid to have this feature, now just paid up for the family subscription and it won't let me sign in! Not bloody happy! I've uninstalled the app now reinstated it and it's still giving me grief. ðŸ¤¬",0
"i love this app but come on guys, add swipe compatibility to android too; it is way too hard to add a song to your queue on android compared to ios cant be that hard guys",0
"I use it everyday at least twice on my commute. My Liked Songs playlist is huge! I follow podcasts I never would have known existed. I like the sleep timer. I also love the Daily Lists made for me based off the songs I like listening to - this is how I find new songs, similar in sound to those I already love. I love this app, it makes me happy, and I'll happily pay for it each month forever.",1
It's an amazing song player like it moves smoothly between each song and has a variety of music for anyone!,1
"Very weak,processing very slow so i rate 1 star.",0
Very good music platform... various stock...,1
"The amount of problems I have for spending 12 or w/e a month is ridiculous. I have to entirely restart the app so that it will continue playing from music I've downloaded. Hooked up to a Google speaker and any song I wanted to add to the queue just gets removed from the list entirely. Granted I'm still here using it because it does have so much music, but there are just so many other moments of ""this is what I'm paying for?"" that I can't remember.",0
Spotify has been satisfying with every urge for my music hunger. It's efficient and has almost every song. Still loving the app and how efficient and catering it is when it comes to all genres of music and podcasts.,1
Last update is pathetic .. it has some systematic problems !!,0
This is the best app for listen music I was ever seen,1
"I pay monthly for this app. I have to force stop the app at LEAST once daily for it to run properly. Get it together, Spotify",0
App no longer works for Android. The play tab doesn't show so you can't pause/change songs etc,0
BRUH I HATE THIS I JUST WANT THE SONGS ON MY PLAYLIST AND I CAN'T PLAY THOSE SONGS BECAUSE YOU ADD RANDOM SONGS,0
This app started picking songs for me that I did not put on my Playlist it is a bad app don't download it.,0
"Now they've purportedly removed the 10k song limit on users libraries I'll like the app even more. One gripe, I used to be able to play my entire library at random....can't do it anymore without individually adding all my liked songs and albums to a playlist. An arduos task!",0
"This app is rubbish. After playing a song you searched for it continues to play random songs with no option to go back or repeat. No way to see your own playlists. What is the point of this app? Whoever designed this would be better off getting a job selling hotdogs... The UX rating for this is a big, fat 0.",0
"Same old glitchy BS from the beginning. This service isn't worth the money. Won't play app closes itself. Stop playing randomly, start playing randomly. So all and all not worth it",0
"Love you, Spotify, but please fix the current bugs. On Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, the control bar at the bottom that is supposed to show pause/play/next/etc is not visible. This is the major bug along with many other little things that I noticed near early April. I have to exit the app once or twice in order for it to reappear. Music also keeps stopping at random. Clearing cache did not make any difference. I don't want to uninstall/reinstall and lose all my downloaded music. ThanksâœŒï¸",0
love it,1
Love it I can jam to one band of my choosing and any album of choice (the whole album) without any interuption!!!!!,1
"It's perfect if you use the premium version. The free version has ads and you can't listen a playlist in the order you want to, you can only shuffle it ( that's why I give it 4 stars ). You can avoid all that with the premium version and it's worth it, plus it's not expensive so that's what I use because I hate ads.",1
"All the music, great selections I just love the app!",1
Since last update stops playing playlist and restarts when I press play. Or just stops and exits.,0
Music quality is best but sometimes your ads! So worst,0
It's just great except I've been trying 2 pull up certain songs that aren't coming up on my search... example like SPLASH WATERFALL REMIX by LUDACRIS/RAPHEAL SAADIQ... Other than that good app..,0
Its Always crashing after playing any audio for 5 to 10 mins.,0
It sometimes goes back to a songs it already played and i have to listen to them again.,1
Worst app i want to play my fvrt songs but they didn't allow me and also skip option only for paid user ....,0
Horrible. Uninstalled. You cant even listened to the song you like unless you played all the song they will first gave you.,0
"For general, I'm satisfied. Except for one point, there is no offline lyrics. If I could see the lyrics for the songs I've downloaded, that would be great. I like the app, though. I will use it anyways, but I hope developers can bring the offline lyrics feature soon.",1
Just all around an easy to use and functional app,0
I enjoy listening to Spotify,1
It fine... theirs 3 ads ariubd every 30 minute or 10 songs but its fine,1
Nothin is ever perfect hence 4 stars. If @joeroganexperience is removed or demonetized I will cancel my monthly subscription. Thank you for allowing Joe Rogans open platform to be just that.,0
"Love it for podcasts, making playlists and discovering new music.",1
"It's so hard to navigate, you have to get premium for basic things like turning off shuffle??? Whats the point of listening to anything on here if I'm getting songs I constantly don't like and always having it navigate away from my Playlist? I just wanna listen to my favorite songs :(",0
Love this app,1
By far the worst acting app on my ph. I would switch music apps if I didn't have thousands of songs downloaded.,0
"Yeah about this update and the ""improvements"" in the app just now, I think this update is straight up stupid. Last month I got it I could play any music I wanted to but now this update just sucks. Even when I listen to songs in my liked songs it has another song I didn't even like, I can't even go back because y'all want money so bad. You guys are just not cool for doing this. And it even says I need premium for the next song. Not cool.",0
Great selection and easy to use.,1
I can't fathom how anyone at Spotify thought it was a good idea to remove the feature that lets you preview songs while creating playlists. Then there's the matter of audio quality which is a level behind youtube music,0
Keeps closing itself down. Really starting to f*** me off,0
Amazing appthank you,1
Love the way you can add different playlists. definitely a good music app.,1
Why can't I listen to my music offline it' doesn't want to play,0
"The updates with Google Maps and download quality are fine, but now the app doesn't let me share songs to Instagram stories? And there is no place to email them with issues. So disappointing.",0
The best app in music but you should add sapne sajn ke too,1
Very good I can find plenty of music to listen to ðŸ˜,1
Love everything everything. I can listen to gospel music all day long.,1
"Good but shuffle play doesn't work properly In a 200 song Playlist it will keep playing the same 40ish songs, so annoying!",0
"Love the product, but the app has too many bugs lately.",0
Spotify does not stay on and stops all of a sudden in between calls ridiculous it's been going on for months now please fix this,0
Latest update broke something. App randomly stops playing when screen is off and other weird behaviour like the player controls not showing in the app or in the notification drawer.,0
I like it! It's a pretty good app to listen music,1
Great,1
Superb,1
Bring back being able to preview a song before adding it to a playlist,0
"PLEASE BRING BACK BEING ABLE TO PLAY THE SONGS WHEN YOU ARE ADDING SONGS TO YOUR PLAYLIST THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY I FOUND NEW MUSIC i dont know why yall changed it, other than that I â¤ spotify",0
"It runs smoothly, finds song fast and have great music quality.",1
Great selection and love the amount of Music to listen tooo!!!,1
"Spotify has been so buggy lately - it keeps pausing/stopping by itself - at the same time, the actual pause button doesn't work when you want to pause/stop your tracks (I've had to turn my phone off to stop my music). I've tried clearing my cache, restarting my phone and uninstalling then re-installing the app. Please fix :-)",0
"Used this paid app for years. It's company now let it fall into a whimpering reduction of it's former self. Celebrate more bugs than an ant hill, rejoice with more glitches than the Matrix. The support for current android systems is laughable. I open my app, where is the player?, might as well force stop it again for the 7th time this morning in hopes that it works. Oh no, don't worry Spotify, I don't mind taking off my welding PPE to restart your garbage app again, I got this.",0
Love it. You guys have built an excellent app. Moving music with new microultrasoundlowfreq waves would the next. Tesla would be proudly your sponsor. Congrats,1
Always use Spotify in the car. My phone is connected via Bluetooth to my pioneer radio but Spotify will no longer connect since the new update.,0
GOD THIS APP IS SO ANNOYING !! THE ADS ARE SO ANNOYING AND I ONLY GET FIVE SKIPS??? SPOTIFY SUCKS I DONT WANT YOUR STUPID PREMIUM BULL.,0
"I love Spotify, makes it easier for me to explore a variety of music. Plus the ads aren't much. â¤ï¸ â¤ï¸ â¤ï¸",0
"On any other phone this would be a 5 star review, I'd just like to bring attention to the fact that the app is barely usable on the Galaxy Note 9. It acts like it doesn't have internet access when it does (regardless of the WiFi or 4G network I'm connected to) and it takes about 5-10 minutes to realize it actually has internet access, then takes another minute or so to load my library.",0
"It sucks. I made a playlist and it added a bunch of random songs. I tried taking them off but there were so many. Once i finally took them all out, whenever i tried to play my playlist it would play another random song that isnt in there. I was never able to listen to my playlist.",0
"I'm a Spotify fan, but the App has a huge Problem. When streaming to my Marantz AV the volume is reeeally coarse. When you want to turn the volume up by one ""step"" it sometimes just jumps like 1/3 of the max volume. That can kill your speakers (and ears) easily. This is unacceptable. And it's the same on two different Phones: Note 10 Lite and Pixel 6. Edit 04.02.22: Problem still persistent. Apparently Spotify does not care about their users migrating to Tidal. Edit 27.05.22: still persistent...",0
By far the best premium music service I've ever used in my life the music quality was amazing selection could be a bit better given licensing is is the only reason why they typically don't have a song and it's rare I run into it the features and functions are far more useful and abundant than any other music service I've used keep up the great work Spotify,1
Great to keep track of sequence and what's next!,1
You can also use apple music on Android it's cheap and sound quality is better over there because of lossless(if you have a good headphones). And apple music also support Dolby Atmos. But Spotify is also good,1
This app is nice,1
"Don't use this app. Stops music controls after starting music so you have to force close to get controls back. Constantly begging to approve their BS, unnecessary permissions.",0
App is good but a lot of ads after some time,0
"I like the app, but I don't like that it is always stuck downloading songs in the background and gets stuck until I open Spotify. Idk if it's clever marketing to get the user to open the app, or if it's a bug...either way it is very annoying and has forced me to consider canceling my premium after years of being a subscriber to Hulu/Spotify. I'm sure no one reads these reviews after reading a few of the others. Shame on you spotify",0
Spotify deleted my account so everyone that's wondering where I'm at.,0
Brilliant. Other than I need to keep re opening the app to get a video up with the podcast I'm listening too,1
"Its a good app, and has lots of the older music that you sometimes cant even find on YouTube. However, my main issue is that it adds songs to your playlists for you, with no warning. Ill play a playlist that Ive made sure is clean (christian family), and a song will pop up that is really gross, screwed up, and has way to much profanity for me to be able to listen to it. I would like it if this autoadd feature was removed, or had a way to disable it in settings.",0
It's a good app for music but due to ads i don't like it,0
Is this sn update or was it just like that i can rather hear the songs that i want shortly or its gonna be that im going to hear a random song that i dont wanna hearðŸ˜­ please fix this or else im uninstalling spotify im coming back on the next sunday Wrote this on the:22.5.2022 To:Amy (this is my sisters account),0
"Censorship is bad. And Spotify is getting pretty heavy handed with its censorship due to authoritarian tyrannical pressure. If they keep this up, I'll have no problem deleting this app since I rarely use it for anything other than listening to podcasts.",0
I work in remote places and love the download for offline listening option,1
Love ItðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ The ability to find pretty much what I want when I want is exactly what I want ðŸ¤ª,1
"Music is great, but Spotify keeps asking for Bluetooth access which I already gave and now the play button moved to the left which is an odd choice. Maybe a bug?",0
Love this app. It notifies me of new songs being released that I might like. They have some great music to help you fall asleep and sleep more soundly.,1
Yup its good but it has a realy realy bad problem if i play song like we dont talk about bruno and when i played it it not that song its other aong its not encanto music so plss fix it ill make it better rate if it is fixed,0
Amazing the best song app ever,1
Hello I downloaded the music but sometimes it didn't work sometimes it work . They suddenly stop while i play the songs.,0
"Used to use Pandora before Spotify, I loved it and didn't mind the ads, but Spotify crushes it, can't really say much more though It was a good up but Spotify is better.",0
The BEST music app EVER!!!!,1
Wifi is not working with spotify,0
someone fix this app it was broken then working and now player won't work songs don't pause and don't even go in oder this is the the third time I'm re installing I can't keep doing this,0
"The app is okay but Everytime I put a song on that I searched, it goes to a different song then the one I put on. When a ad pops up it say no interuptions for 30 min, but when I go to a different song another ad pops up. It is very annoying.",0
"Update June 7: still happening. - I have to clean the cache for a song to work. One, the apps both here and pc are terrible. Slow and super heavy. No, I do not want to cache anything for optimum use. 5gb of cache daily? Really? If I wanted music downloaded, I'd do that myself. Two, Joe Rogan. The only thing that keeps me here is the work I had with my playlists. When I find a solution to this, goodbye.",0
It has been incredibly buggy in the last week. No way to pause the song with out shutting down the app. And then it pauses frequently for no reason. Fix it thank you. I've have spotify premium for 7 years now and it's never been this bad,0
had it since 2015 and i love it so much especially the end of the year wrap up,1
"Pretty great selection, very eclectic.",1
The best music streaming service out there!,1
"Sucks Spotify makes you pay to pick the music you'd like to walk too. I don't mind paying for Spotify, but not being able to set a q without paying, is a huge downfall.",0
"App keeps crashing. Have tried loging out n loging in, restarting the phone, reinstalling nothing seems to work ......ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²",0
Fantastic App! Subscribe! Very intuitive and excellent content! Listen to Joe Rogan all day long! Malone interview is very informative. We should be ashamed of our medical industries tyrannical ambitions!,1
"Would rate higher except for a storage bug which boggs down my phone. Every time my device restarts or the app updates, it reverts the download location to device storage and begins to download my entire library again.",0
"I've only just started using Spotify, but I enjoy it. It plays the music I enjoy and, so far, no repeats.",1
Spotify is the best spot for all bollywood collectons and I recommend it to anyone. Thank you Spotify.,1
Awesome selection of music in all genres! ðŸ™ŒðŸ»,1
The best music streaming app with gap less mixingyoud swear you have a Dj in your phone,1
Love it Amazing app,1
"This version just collapse when i press play button. First starts the ad and immediately collapses. I do like this app, but unfortunately I need to use another app. Let me know what must have gone wrong.",0
"Well, all in all Spotify Premium is great and so is the app in general, i can listen and download my music and podcasts but when I'm offline some of my downloaded music doesn't play and it crashes occasionally.",0
Beautiful excellent it's help me to relax and listen favourite singers,1
Luv their music selection I need vintage music works like a good marriage.,1
It's definitely the best music streaming app. The recommendations are top notch. Discover weekly has introduced me to so much new music.,1
"This is one of the best apps.even it's adds are interesting. Premium comes and small prices and it has a wide variety of songs,which i love",1
just hate the ads but great app,1
Informative and entertaining... very well...,1
"When is the music player widget going to get updated for material you on Android 12? For example, the YouTube music widget looks much better...",0
The previous update broke Spotify so thank you for fixing it .I didn't Realize how much I relied on this app,0
Hey..I have been using this app from a long time....and I love this app..so much...but from some days..I am getting some issues...my some liked songs are hidden itself and I am unable to unhide it... please help me out..,0
Without premium it's totally useless,0
Would be 5 but since updates it stops playing when my screen times out.,0
I use this app to listen to podcasts whether it's crime or documentary and I LOVE IT!,1
Great music quality,1
This app is good but if you put Romanized lyrics it could be better but it's good,1
Very nice. Enjoy pods n music,1
It is a cool app,1
Spotify is a great app it is so awesome has all the songs u need But sometimes it Lags,1
There is currently a bug on my Samsung note 10 plus where the music bar dissappear and you can't pause or play music,0
Spotify could you make it so that we can see our song and playlist just that playlist busily before you updated spotify piz??? It was good the way it was before you updated it.,0
"Click link, log in with google, already regitered, log witout password, you can only use 14days in another country without a way to set it. Good luck keeping customers!",0
App is very very nice song,1
Love the variety of stations,1
Excellent collection of music along with many more options. Very high-quality listening experience. I do recommend to anyone to just try it once .,1
Love the ease of using and the greatest collection âœ¨ï¸ music,1
Frustrating app. Continues to over ride other streaming apps no matter the settings.,0
Expect ads everything is good,1
"Got a minor bug: In the ""liked songs menu"" you can filter the songs based on the genre. I use the aforementioned menu to get new music to add to a designated playlist later. The issue is if you filter it to a genre, then un-like the all the songs in that filter you can't select a different filter even if you take spotify out of your running apps and run it again. The only way to fix it is to add a song of the ""filter genre""",0
This app was better before there were not many ads . Everytime I open the app after listening to one song there are 4 to 5 ads continuous listen to song 3 times and listen to ads 5 times . Please fix this.,0
No canvas feature available in most Android phones,0
This app is so hard to navigate on phone if I click a a song a have liked it goes to didn't song I never heard or it might play a demo of the song that is dumb it should play the song,0
"it took me ages to find and cancel my auto plan because it kept saying something went wrong in the app so i had to open it from the website after they automatically charged me without any pre notification, why does it always have to be automatically charged when choosing a plan. and refunds are confusing idek if i can refund the premium plan after an auto charge, rigged app.",0
It's the best music platform I have ever seen even you can listen the song in your playlist even tho when your one day data plan is over and that also kpop pop and many more that you keep in your playlist I love this but the thing is that I am facing some problem to set ringtone with it but it's ok,1
Love it daily premium listener and can't be happier. Cheap affordable quality music literally at my fingertips 6/5ðŸŒŸ,1
I was realy annoyed by the app not letting play a song i wanted to listen to and make it a mandatory feature for them to add ramdom songs to my playlist. But the fact that they limit skips per hour made me uninstall this garbage app,0
Best musical app i have ever seen,1
"I re-downloaded the app because I liked it better than any other music app, but every Playlist is empty and none of the podcasts work. I have premium and I checked, all of the other apps on my phone work and I have a strong data connection so I don't understand what is wrong. I'd really hate to delete my account again.",0
Intuitive to my musical taste. Easy to use. Simply the best!,1
"I really enjoy Spotify it has many songs and podcasts, you can listen to, it's also nice that if you download episodes you can listen offline .",1
"Only thing keeping me with Spotify is the playlists I've made. Their apps keep crashing on Android, finicky compatibility with Android auto, and the now playing bar at bottom of mobile app has been gone for a minute now. It makes me feel like they just don't care anymore? Sorry, Spotify. Just disappointed",0
"Music that's matched to me, spot on!!!!! Thanks Spotify I wrote that 9 word review 2 years ago and now, in 2022 I don't need to say anything more. It's still my go to music app every single day. I don't know what I would do without it. Spotify is like my dog, a Moodchanger & a Lifesaver! You Rock Spotify !!!",1
Amazing ,1
Music and videos are clear and excellent sound quality,1
"I loved it, but now it's annoying. You keep adding stuff to my Playlist, and won't let me listen to my liked music.",0
Much improveit is getting better Quite generous with the free package thanks I absolutely do not like Spotify suggested song The stop suggest songs didnt seem to work Otherwise everything is great update turns out  I need to add more songs to my play list to stop Spotify from making bad suggestions I am quite satisfied ads is not that bad at all 5 stars,1
"Ads are good , but ads get interrupted by songs sometimes â˜•",0
"With the last update, I am not able to see which song I am playing at the moment, not even on the homescreen nor the playlist itself, kind of annoying if I want to know the song's name and/or add it to a playlist. I am using a Xiaomi 11T",0
Real nice app for streaming and discovering new artists only issue I see is the local music folder it always refreshes and starts from the top of the list ones you leave a song,1
Amazing! But too many ads.,0
"Tech bros behaving badly. The technical aspects of this app are overwhelmed by management's contempt for musicians, healthcare workers, and anyone else that gets between them and an easy dollar. Can no longer condone the antics of these brats. Bye!",0
All is very well n gud.... But we want English translation for korean songs.... So i m requesting you to look forward to it ðŸ˜Š,1
"Been using this for several years now and just love it. Easy, intuitive, makes great playlists easy, trending lists to suit your listening styles etc. Can't imagine life without this (and DIFM) .",1
"Everything is good, but too much of advertisemens!!!!",0
Why'd y'all remove the enhance button in playlists?! Was the best feature.,1
Music kept me entertained very much â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ,1
Really.. 3 ads every 2 songs? ðŸ˜„,0
"Keeps deleting downloaded songs, don't buy premium if you think the song downloading works cause it will randomly delete yours songs. 1/10 would not recommend!",0
"i love spotify but, its only good good if you have premium otherwise its hard to find the exact song your looking for",1
Has been buggy for me lately. Sometimes songs will randomly pause then play like 3 seconds later. Also sometimes when I open the app I can play music but I can see the song that I'm playing + can't skip/rewind.,1
"Can't even choose a song. If you select a specific song, the app will choose some other song for you.",0
"Since your last update, I can't get ANY music to play. The ads, however, come through brilliantly ðŸ‘ Good job! Hope you know sarcasm when you hear it because I am disgusted with this whole thing. I have a feeling if I upgrade to premium and start giving you $ it would work. This is BS!!",0
Took away car mode without a suitable replacement,0
"some people might not have a chance to get spotify premium but seriously recommend doing so because you can listen to any music or podcasts you want there's even movie soundtracks and playlists for any vibe your looking for and a plus is that at the end of the year they give you a ""spotify wrapped"" wich is very fun",1
super,1
"It's great for on the go music, in the classroom and it's easy to use",1
Really good experience ðŸ‘Œ no cap,1
Damn My profile picture was in my Spotify and click man I love the playlist thank you so much,1
It's been fun actually. Great music experience,1
"I Use It EVERYDAY, Throughout The Whole Day And I Am Truly Appreciative If It. Thank You.",1
"Samsung Galaxy S10+ and recently Spotify just keeps disappearing, pausing, freezing",0
Equalizer is just bad in this app. I always try to listen the songs i liked on yt cause it gives me the bass I want. I can't adjust it on the Spotify app settings the way I want. And It doesn't allow to work the equalizer settings that I adjusted on the phone's sound settings. I want deep bass sound and spotify's equalizer is just bad to adjust that.,0
"Good but throws awful covers into my playlist that I don't want, and then the only way to get rid of it is to pay a subscription.",0
Latest update sucks like vacuum the positive experience until date. Fix the bs.,0
"Edited from 5 to 1. You can no longer use a proxy to have an account, that means they sold out, probably blackmailed since Rogan that they would be shut down OR they can spy and report everything you listen to, search for, like to the ministry of truth, Uninstalled use a different app if you are for free speech",0
I have enjoyed using spotify.it is fun creating liked play lists.,1
"Lots of problems lately with songs duplicating in the queue, not being able to select a song to play from my phone when casting, and songs in queue disappearing among other issues.",0
"Love the app. What it allows us to do us crazy. But the fact that everything defaults to ""shuffle"" and I can't customize that behavior is maddening. Nuts driving.",0
was great till all my playlists decided to just be available to preview only.,0
Worst app...whenever I click on the search button there shows a black screen and I directly comes to home screen...the app hangs too much...I want to give it 0 stars..,0
I just love Spotifyyyyyyy!!!!,1
I highly suggest not getting this. I have tried 3 months now to cancel my subscription. It says its canceled yet they keep taking funds from me. Try to comtact support but there isnt any human recources or human customer service. Just written suggestion... Amazon music is way better then this junk.,0
Why did you remove the like button on the widget for Android ? It's very annoying to have to go back to the app everytime!,0
"I feel like getting 6 ads in a row is a bit much for not paying for premium, but whatever, it's still better than most music apps",1
I enjoy the songs that are on here it's very rare to find a song that I liked that isn't on here it's mainly just songs from TV shows or movies the ads are a little annoying but they didn't take away from the experience I still love this app,1
This is the best app. I use it to listen to music and podcasts. User friendly layout and even personalized albums based on the genre you listen to.,1
"It's the best especially when you are using premium, i like how it recommends songs based on your test of music, you guys deserve my 5 star",1
Definitely a five star app. It has every song in the book. Plus lyrics. And it's fast.,1
I love this app but I can't listen to my music like I try to play it but it wont work it show me how the song is then ends without starting from the beginning and ending it goes mid way then stops I'm not sure I'd need the 3 month trial or it a glitch.,0
best music app ever!,1
"The app have problems,I'm using premium plan for the first two month works perfectly,but now it totally can't use anymore,keep skipping songs and liked songs gone crazy and can't connect to the Internet.pls pls solve the problem ASAP.......",0
"After getting the 1 month subscription Spotify app on my windows 11 is not working! It shows ""Spotify can't play this right now. if u have the file in your computer you can import it"". I have even tried reinstalling the app but it still acts the same. + All Songs aren't downloading in my mobile!",0
"Going down hill. Vers 8.7.20.1261 lost controls until force stopped the app or restarted phone 8.7.22.1125 then plays one connected session before failing again. Udated to latest, worse. Does all the above plus now stops & starts randomly in the track & then finally stops. It was bad enough when it stopped working with my Garmin Zumo but now it doesn't work with my Samsung A51 5G. I have a family account with spotify. I expect a refund for this month and if this doesn't sort quickly, acct closed",0
"Crashes all the time after last update, will only work for short time after reinstall before it stops working",0
The play bar completely disappeared. No longer have the ability to like or rewind songs,0
"It has alot of songs of any genre, and if you pay the premium then it just gets better and better, 10/10 recommended",1
Wow,1
I'm not using premium package or trial.. But this is the best app for streaming online music. You get all the oldies,1
"Im suddenly logged out and im frustrated. I cant get back in, it was great, but now idk whats going on",0
"Excellent selection of music and I like the way it knows what songs I enjoy, great application!!",1
Please fix the bug that shuffles the song i want to hear whenever i play a song or go in my playlist liked song it always shuffles please fix it. Other than that I don't think there is a big issue. Thankyou.,0
"I loved this app. Tons of options for music/podcasts. I loved it so much I got the premium and it was totally worth it until a few months ago and it started glitching. Every time I clicked a song/podcast it would play but wouldn't go to it. No option to stop/skip/read descriptions. Even clicking ""Go to episode"" wouldnt work. Then within 2-3 days or so it would update and fix. Then like 2 weeks later the same thing happened then fixed.Then again and again. I wish they would fix the issue for good",1
I used to have 5 stars up there but every week more and more songs I like no longer available it's almost time to close my account I guess been a member since before I can remember it's sad to feel this way probably 10 year member atleast paid subscription,0
Awesome the music is very uplifting especially during outdoor exercise the music help to relax,1
Extremely glitchy and annoying for a paid service. Biggest problem is it resets to the beginning of the JRE podcast after the ads in the middle. Still very glitchy!!,0
"Ok. I'm a 73-year-old senior living on social security in California. The cost of living has got so high, I live in my car. Spotify, Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, etc are affordable, and on my car sounds system, they are fabulous. So I have an amazing social life, and in my own space I'm enjoying top quality entertainment. When I step out of my living space, I'm already at the location of my choice! And Spotify has all my favorite music right there for me.",1
Awesome app and it has replaced all other music apps on my devices. Absolutely love Spotify.,1
"I love Spotify and all the music it brings me, but recently I've experienced trouble using the lock screen widget (it no longer exists), so I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, now the app won't even open!",0
Its my therapy,1
The thing that makes me sad is cannot set sleeper time,0
I'm taking back my bad review guys.... Amazing....u guys added lyrics to everything.....now it's the perfect and most lovable app I'm using.....no words.... Love SpotifyðŸ’œðŸ’œ,1
"The music that I like always on hand. ""Alexa...play my music""",1
Best music platform ever,1
Android app is trash. Half the time the playback option is not visible. Crashes and buggy. Needs to be fixed or cancelling Spotify all together.,0
"This app has the most AGGRESSIVE and POINTEDLY TARGETED advertisements on the entire app store. As someone with student loan debt, it's frustrating to be served ads about it every other song... it's like they're trying to BULLY you into paying for premium so you don't have to think about money. Somehow they found out my browsing history to see I had made payments on student debt. Way to spoil the mood you weirdos. Save your time and money, listen on desktop with adblock.",0
the new update sucks I don't know why when I want to listen to the music I want it's play another music you should fix that,0
Beast of music,1
"Service itself is good, but the app definitely needs an update. After one song you have to open the app to change songs and doesn't even say a song is playing on S10. Problem for some months now, it's just plain annoying now. It's gotten much worse.",0
I pay for premium and still get ads. Ads are flaming piles of ****. Â£14 a month for my podcasts to be interupted by adverts.,0
"There's no way to turn off autoplay, but i found a solution, just uninstall the app. Works great, it never plays now. Fix this, Jesus Christ, so annoying. Zero stars, worst music app ever.",0
I'm not sure if anyone has been having similar issues but basically since March the app has been freezing and crashing. It won't load artwork and it takes five minutes for a song to load. I'm a very busy person who doesn't have time to wait for a song to load every time I turn on the app. I have switched to YouTube premium with music until Spotify gets it together. I have used it exclusively for the last five years but the app performance is so bad that I finally canceled my premium sub.,0
the hit is so nice,1
"Absolutely perfect, always works and it's always performed for me.... Even when needing updated, and never noticed anything negative after an update.",1
The best music streaming platform ever - besides Apple Music lol,1
Damn good quality songs,1
Way to many ads. Stop trying to get poor people to pay sh**.,0
This app is brilliant every single song is here,1
Making me log in every single time I use the app even minutes apart is so annoying that I'm going to cancel my subscription if you don't fix this! Worked great for years. Now I'm getting logged out every 5 mins.,0
"This app provides a lot but the constant playback issues and glitches have only gotten worse. Randomly disconnects from bluetooth, stops randomly during playback, half the time the bar in the notification tray does nothing. It seems spotify doesn't care if it's app is functional. If this continues I'm cancelling my prime. I don't need to pay for broken garbage, I can get that for free.",0
"I love this app because it allows me to listen to all kinds of music and podcast, I definitely recommend this app.ðŸ‘",1
I am able to play music but some of the time the music is going to a different song instead of my actual list and I haven't even finished the playlist yet!!! Fix it.,0
It will be playing well for a few songs then it suddenly stops playing music when phone is locked a pain when I'm listening to music while riding a motorcycle and can't go into my phone and once again shuffle my playlist,0
This app is good but one problem is adverticement. So please try to cover up this problem.,0
Gave it a five because it was a nicely packaged application. I would never ever pay for this service and changed the rating because the company's corporate politics merit a zero.,0
"Annoying!!! Please move it back how it was or make it better. I can't just pick the song I want from my list, I have to skip other songs to get what I want. It just plays the song for about 10s, you can see the circle spinning and goes back to the one I was listening previously. Annoying!!! Again. What did you do? It took my a while to figure it out how to make it work. It's not intuitive at all... Will change my review after it's fixed, please make it good. But now, I'm annoyed.",0
"Edit: Spotify for Android gets worse every update. Spotify is a great company, but the Android app is very bad. The app is very laggy, even after multiple cache clear outs and uninstalls. I have stoped updating the app because the app never really changes.",0
"Needs few things to get 5th star. 1. Lyrics for songs, 2. List of all songs from an artist, 3. Option to sort songs by popularity (on a list of songs from an artist). Other than those few little things, app works great if you pay for premium Edit: the lyrics got added, just a bit more!",0
I give 3 star bcause...How to off shuffle on Spotify w android...cause it's just have love button in there :/ .....or it's just my problem,0
Just everything you could ever want from music app. Podcasts are great especially when the podcast is exclusive to Spotify and the quality is always top tier.,1
too good app.. really love itâ¤â¤â¤but i dunno why my search option is not opening.. please fix the promblem.. but really very nice app...,1
Very ease of access,1
Problem: I can't deal with this app anymore for a while now my app hasn't been functioning right. When I click to play the song I want it puts a completely diferent song on ðŸ˜• So I can no longer listen to a song I want. Improve: pretty much every song is explicit so could you maybe change that. Thank you for reading ðŸ™‚ P.s please fix these because it was managing fine for a couple of years ty. :),0
Good Playlist and providing opportunities to upcoming music talent also.,1
"Buggy - app refuses to allow me to listen to anything after newest update. It keeps connecting to 'a device' and pausing immediately after I hit play. Checked all my settings, cleared my cache, uninstalled and reinstalled. Nothing. Still won't work :/",0
"This is a great app for listening to music, podcasts etc.",1
"Would be better, but they're obsessed with shuffle, and they don't let you reset progress on podcasts easily",0
recent update has removed the widget. but why? bring it back because people use it!,0
"This app has lots of podcasts and I love those , you can also try these podcasts of Crime & Thriller.",1
"The app is very good. I got to explore many new songs. However, I took out a star because of a few reasons. First:- It sometimes lags and won't show the music dialog box on your screen or in the app and for this I have to restart it. Second:- I cannot delete my history on phone. Third:- I cannot shuffle playlists or Albums. They have to play on the fixed sequence. Fourth:- I cannot see which song is going to play next if it's a radio and Fifth:- Sometimes the song stops and doesn't start radio",0
"I would give it a perfect 5 star but it has only one problem. It keeps on irritating and IRRITATING!!! I've lost my patience!! It continuously irritates with ads unless and until I buy the premium membership. Please reduce the ads, Please....!!!",0
Hi I love this app so much but there is only 1 problem why I can't open ishowspeed shake song can. U please fix this ;( i can't quit this app I love it so much,1
"App won't stop spamming me with pop ups to enable special Bluetooth permissions, which are not necessary to listen to music. Lots of graphical glitches with Android 12.",0
It's good for music use it almost every day it's confusing how to change plans but it's fine alot of different music and it recommends hood artist from my taste I've told my friends about it I love it easy to work easy to look for music alot of ads if you have standard edition so I would recommend premium,1
"My god, if you are to use any version use the computer version, this will add random songs to your playlist, and give you limited skips so you can't go through them. The ads they also give you are so much more annoying, you cant even close the tab they open, and the only way to avoid these things is pay for premium Would not recommend to anyone, use the computer version if you really want spotify, this is a blatant cash grab.",0
I am not able to listen to podcasts offline even though I have downloaded them please fix this,0
Spotify provides an immense range of accssessing music and podcasts casts.,1
Worstttt !!! Only a premium member gets everything even in selecting the songs to be played and guess what only 6 skips an hour....This is just Insane.,0
Conservatively speaking came from You-Tube 4 music & nomore ads every 1 song! Great so far love being able to walk & have music without AD after ADâ—ðŸ¥‡ðŸ†ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ™,1
They have EVERY thing and I mean EVERY thing! LITERALLY EVERY thing! And I'm still discovering and re-discovering EVERY thing!!!!ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ðŸ¼,1
Would like to be able to talk to a person when needed too,1
Phenomenal ,1
It'll become 5 stars if you guys can have an option to turn off lyrics. Nothing more aggravating than trying to swipe across for a new song and the app scolls down instead because of lyrics.,0
App often hangs when opening library of downloaded podcast episodes.,0
"I don't know what update was done but it's terrible! For an android phone I have to continuously restart my phone as the app doesn't let me pause, skip or select songs. And when my phone times out spotify stops playing and to turn it off I have to log out! My whole family is having this problem!",0
"i like it alot im on a family premium with by best friend and there are no ads on what ever platform i use no matter if it my xbox,phone or my chromebook,its amazing 10/10 i love it",1
Definitely having some issues with the player recently. Needs an update,0
Plays music but the bar disappears where it shows what im listening to also stops playing out of nowhere,0
Random pausing has been getting worse and now the player completely disappears and I can't pause play or skip songs at all. it's just not there.,0
"Without subscription, the app is just for ads for made for music. Waste one, we can go with other music app.....",0
Lately the transport control has disappeared meaning I have to force close the app to stop it playing.,0
Giving 4 stars because of the ad experience its far better than Ganna but the thing is they are so irritating Suggestion :- add ads of third party ads they are not irritating,0
"Myself, I enjoy sitting and listening to the old time radio stories from my childhood.",1
"This was the best app up until the recent update. Now (I'm also paying) when I play my music it doesn't even play or do anything. Even when I Uninstall the app then re-install it. It still doesn't work. Very frustrating indeed. I've had this app for a long time. Come on developers, get it right. Looks like I'm reinstalling for good. 11/06/21 Now I'm really frustrated with this damn app. What the hell am I paying for when the damn thing doesn't even play half the time. Fix you app. Uninstallin",0
"Limited song options and if you don't have premium like I did you'll experience so many advertisements that is ridiculous. I remember one time on my way to school I had 10 minutes worth of just advertisements, I don't know if it wouldn't gone longer before I turned it off.",0
IT WILL definitely know what kind of music and songs you would want to listen to .... a state of art music app ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
It's the worst music app I've ever used it changes my playlists and only let's me skip 6 times per hour. I'd rather use youtube music than this.,0
It's simply the best. I love it and enjoy my music with no stress . I sleep well and music is still playing. ðŸ‘Œ,1
Been a Spotify user for years & it is THE BEST,1
Best music app experience!! Would 100% recommend to anyone,1
Hello Spotify!! Please provide language setting to change the lyrics to English for all other songs in different languages like BTS songs the lyrics are only in korea it helps listen the songs on loop to learn the songs and lyrics and also I'm experiencing a lot of ad interruptions while listening to songs because of this I really cant listen more than a 30mins and I lost my interest to listen songs in this app,0
Literally one of the best music apps you can find on playstore,1
Great but trouble removig songs,0
I fell for fake news for hating spotify . I was wrong and i love joe rogan podcast . Thx fake news to introduce me to his podcast. The most reasonable autentic podcast . I wish we had a french canadian version of the joe rogan podcast. Someone step up plz.,0
It is good music with only a few adds,1
K I love this app but lately it's been glitch city. When I set it to offline mode it doesn't allow me to listen to my downloads which is literally the whole freakin point of a premium subscription so uh yeah getting really annoyed,0
Subscription is way too expensive for what the app and features offers especially when the app is a mess in bugs and glitches,0
"There's a problem when adding music to playlists, it doesn't allow you to preview the songs anymore.",0
"I've used and loved this service for years but recently the app continuously crashes, the window with play information doesn't display which means you can't control the music and have to force close the app to stop and songs cut out part way through. I've uninstalled/reinstalled several times and followed troubleshooting to no avail. I don't expect this from a service I pay a premium for and will change services if this continues.",0
Has ads every so often but over all 10000/10. You can play music while playing a. Mobile game or doing homework without having to keep you phone on,1
Its The Best Music App I Have Ever Seen,1
Very good .....way better than audio mack......,1
Login process has stopped,0
Been using this app for many years and it's the ONLY one I'll ever use!!,0
I love this app this is the best music streaming app but the past day my spoitfy hasnt been working on my android auto when I am connected to 5g it just started today but yesterday it was working perfectly I domt know why,1
Always satisfied with Spotify and have been subcribe to them for over 3 years now. Subscription is worth it!,1
"Used for a year, and it's better than Pandora, however.. Missing the most basic feature, play history. This is why I refuse to pay. I use Pandora and Spotify to discover new music, and when I can't look up who just played, whats the point really? Edit: Still broken.",0
My single biggest problem with this app is that i cannot edit my playlists at all. It is locked on the free version and that has to be one of the stupidest locks that could exist. Please change this,0
Its a great app but it always keeps it on shuffle play,1
It's a five star for me! Cause they added all the songs (k-pop) they had removed! But please add promise by jimin!,1
"I still love Spotify.. but what's up? The radio stations, my personal mixes.. they seem off. Sometimes it's just a playlist, not even radio, when I create a station?! It's just not the same. Bands that shouldn't be with the others, too much of the same band, repeating songs, different genres that don't mesh. I don't know what changed, but it makes me sad, I miss the old Spotify.",0
Way too many adds. It's literally bloated with obnoxious commercials. At times your music selection goes completely off and shows a random music unrelated to your already set preferences.,0
Discover your music taste by listening to new thing. And this app tracks what u listen to. Thats great to fall back on old and newer music. But they should add ' slow fade ' at the end of songs like apple music.,0
"The best music app I know, and yet the ads are more than music ðŸ˜. At least in the free version, you were free to choose the music. We are very satisfied with the user interface of the program and it is really easy to work.",1
I like the music,1
Horrible. Worthless. No updates. Podcasts restart. App always out of sync. Constantly force closing app and restarting. NO SUPPORT!!!!! WORTHLESS!!! Everytime your phone or Spotify updates good lucky having the app work as advertised!! Take my money and screw me over all in one motion. Way to go Spotify! UPDATE: 6/13/22 SHUFFLE HAS STOPPED WORKING AND SHOWS NO SIGNS OF COMING BACK. WAY TO GO SPOTFY!,0
"Very poorly optimised. Firstly, whenever I open the app and do not have an internet connection, the app will say no internet connection and then procced to try and load content for the next 20 seconds. Why not automaticaly only display downloaded content in offline mode instead of render the app unusable for 20 seconds? Secondly, the app has numerous small bugs on my samsung galaxy S20 running the latest software. I expected alot more for an app I pay 13 dollars a month for.",0
Would be five star if you can actually pick a song without going to a playlist,1
"I love the enhance feature, but for some reason the enhance feature for my liked songs has dissapeared. That enhance feature was quite useful, so i'm quite dissapointed it doesn't work for my likes playlist anymore",0
I like it but I have one problem that is the extra songs I hate it when my favorite songs end one of the extra songs starts to play plz delete it,0
Love Spotify. New music notifications. Playlist options. Ability to play music based on song or artist. Cost and family shar abilities are excellent!,1
Used to show controls such as pause and fast forward/ rewind 15 seconds. Cannot do this anymore.,0
Was Best app . Like once upon a Time! Changes are challenging! Extra unwanted Songs thrown in by....who knows?. If I didn't select it....means I didn't want to hear them.,0
It is good when ever we want we can select wished songs â¤ðŸ‘,1
One of the best song streaming,1
I love this app. It has all of my favorites. Every one should download the app.,1
Perfect app to listen to music it has so many options and settings that you can customize i love it,1
Great at playing everything but the songs I want to listen to.,1
Can deal with the ads to an extent...but giving a platform racism and misinformation is too much for me.,0
Spotify is really great. I love the sound quality and the way it creates playlists for you is crazy. I only listen to Spotify songs and it's so AMAZING!!!,1
Spotify has all the music I need to dance to sing and to practice my singing voice people I chose from Spotify reminded me of my voice I'm happy with my voice Spotify give a chance to sing in front of people who are watching me on Facebook and on WhatsApp and thanks to does people I'm not afraid to sing in front of people anymore thank you all for your time,1
"It has this annoying glitch where if you login just using your email you cannot login after restarting your phone and need to uninstall then reinstall, effectively losing all your music library.",0
It is the best app to have because you can see and hear different artists and you can interact with music. And I put it on in the car for my kids! And I love the person who made it ðŸ’• â¤ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜ðŸ¤©ðŸ˜˜ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ˜ðŸ¤ªðŸ˜œðŸ˜›ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž,1
"So I made a play list for songs I enjoy and I watched an add for 30 mins or uninterrupted music and it interrupts my music with ""suggested songs"" that I dont wanna hear and listen to and I tried to go back to my liked songs but I have to listen to the other song 1st and then I can only hear 1 of my liked songs and then it goes to a different one that's bot even close to my taste in music and I hate it",0
"my overall experience with spotify has been pretty good! other than the fact that i am a minor with no job and i can't afford premium, the ads i've seen have gotten tremendously better with their length and the number of them. listening to music offline has been a hassle, but overall, very good app!",1
Excellent app Everybody should download & experience amazing songs,1
"It's extremely annoying that I need an internet connection to view my ""downloaded"" content. That tells me that it isn't truly downloaded. In addition, the app will suddenly show that nothing is downloaded, and content is simply listed in my ""episodes."" Later, even though I haven't done anything and wasn't near wifi, it will show my content as ""downloaded"" again. Shouldn't the app actually download my selections to my phone?",0
Good,1
I love it ,1
The best app ever for streaming music ðŸ”¥,1
"Being a music lover at young age I was able to listen to all the music I grew up with, all the music that as far I can remember them. The era of my teenage years, the 80's (all the genre specially new wave), 90's alternative rock, grunge, the hair bands and until now. Music is everything to me. Music is my life, Spotify is life ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ§ðŸ¤˜ðŸ‘ðŸ˜Ž",1
Garbage. Always glitching out. Can't change songs most times. Premium account for poverty service.,0
Ok this app is good but please remove limited skips I have the subscription for it and I love it but the free version is just so bad so make it so you have unlimited skips the ads are fine but the limited skips are just bad so please remove that,0
"The best in business, absolutely love the way it is. The premium is so worth it, and the huge selection of songs and podcastsðŸ˜. Started using it from last 3 years and the experience is awesome.",1
App is working good nownow I can found my all favorite song,1
Every three days my downloaded library deletes itself from offline mode. Tried updating clearing cache. Same issues. Starting to become less and less time before I have to re download everything just to use the service paid for. Users beware of issues.,0
Best music streaming app I've come across so far!,1
"Fix the app, or I'll cancel my Premium subscription. Constantly freezing, play bar disappearing, and glitching out. Unacceptable.",0
"Was amazing until my phone updated. Now it doesn't do anything on mobile at all. My liked tracks just shows ""something went wrong try again"", my daily mixes and playlists are empty, search results never even show up....this is the only app that doesn't work on my phone since the update, please fix it. I don't really wanna go back to pandora. Galaxy a10e",0
"Now spotify has stopped working completely. In place of fixing the issue, they are increasing the issue. No Internet connection is displayed even with a 200 MBPS stable connection.",0
Picking a controversial character over a musician is a big mistake. Made my choice between this and YouTube music easy. Bye.,0
Can't use any other app now that I've used Spotify. Like it's UI. The one thing I wish it had was it's previous group session. The newer remote only group session isn't working well.,0
I love the variety of music you can find....commercials are a bit annoying but it comes with the free one ðŸ˜‰ Thanks Spotify,1
"App keeps disappearing the play bar, can't play/pause on my phone. Had to use my computer to control sound from my phone. Constant app issues over the past 6 months make me even more interested in seeing what other services are out there.",0
It won't show the current playing track when connecting to a car via Bluetooth. Just shows the first track you play forever. Been a bug for well over 6 months.,0
Spotify is my life line. I love this app I use it every single day.,1
"Please increase the volume of the musics. Sound quality should be more good, rich and enhanced. In home tab, contents are taking much time to load. Make spotify lightweight and fast. There have huge battery consumption while streaming.",0
The app used to be great for years. Something has changed in the last 6 months. I don't like using it anymore.,0
Good music app. The shuffle function is meh.,1
Paying 10 a month for premium is a bit too high,0
Spotify is the best music app but adds are dispointed,0
Who ever developed the feature for others to use MY speaker automatically. I hope you get fired and have a horrid life. Especially after I've turned off your stupid feature and then today I open up to a notification that some moron turned it back on for me as if it was a good thing for me. I sincerely hope the person who made this a feature boils from the inside out.,0
Update... The app isn't loading playlists now... The loading circle just spins... ... It constantly seems like the app gets overwhelmed and doesn't know what to do so it just crashes... Been going on foooooorever now,0
A very good music app with literally hundres of thousands songs! Personal playlist made daily and weekly automatically and always find what I'm looking for.,1
Excellent,1
The app open speed is so low. The app takes a huge time to load..,0
Great music app works well for me.,1
"Can't go through my day without this, the best thing I have on my phone.",1
Downloaded this app just because it will sponsor FC BARCELONA next season. Forca BarcaðŸ’™â¤ï¸,0
Amazing content and sound delivery.,1
I like this spotify becouse i like playing musics so for me 4 star,1
Play bar is now missing when you play your music forcing you to relaunch the app,0
enjoyed listening to songs I haven't heard in a long time.,1
Amazing ðŸ‘ like if u see this u have to download it because Spotify has any music you want ðŸ˜,1
With a good bluetooth speaker and spotify I dont need,1
music list Spr Sound quality Good Device Connected Like it And Play Music ðŸŽ¶ Good feeling,1
But middle advertisement are so bad,0
Annoying. Keeps stopping the song after 12 seconds. Going back to you tube music.,0
They would add their songs to MY PLAYLIST! I can't make a playlist without having songs I didn't put on it on.,0
Spotify has been buggy at the gym. At home it's ok. I am canceling my premium sub because it's not worth it since I have Amazon prime anyway.,0
"Best music app ever invented. In addition to the largest music library out there, what I really like is how good the recommendations are. Finding new music is as easy as just tapping the enhance playlist button. Please add podcasts for Pakistanis. We're really missing out on that.",1
I enjoy my Spotify experience. Ads are necessary evil if you use it as a free app,0
"This app changed my life best app ever. support barcelona pls, we need to buy erling haaland ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º",1
Awesome the best music I listened to every day with my work mates too great way to do a work out at the gym too,1
"Even thought some there are some out there song I can get, such a great App to lookup any genre I need and listen all day to.",1
I have been a paid pandora user for about 12 years but recently i bought a new samsung tv and pandora doesn't work on it. It also appears that pandora is pretending to address the issue while doing nothing at all to resolve it. This led me to check out spotify and it seemed ok the few times i used it but i had to uninstall it from both my phone and tv after only a few days use because it seems that spotify doesn't believe that people have a right to be free to speak their mind. Bye Felicia!,0
Not as good as it used to be. Also loved the app spotify stations but they just shut it down.,0
"Really good for casual listeners , one of the best features and the feature to difficult ui ratio is also kinda high so yeah it's the best",1
"Extremely buggy, especially when it comes to playing on a Bluetooth speaker",0
This latest update is nothing but trouble. Songs stop playing when the phone isn't open. It won't always connect to my car. The controls aren't on the lock screen. I could go on. It's extra annoying since I pay for the full access and clearly no one is getting their money's worth.,0
"You can't find everything you love on YouTube, but it's a decent music app. A genre-filter for playlists would be awesome.",1
Living below the poverty level and getting to listen to the vast collection available for free is wonderful. Sure I'd like the perks of membership but I can deal with having way less ads than radio ever had.,0
"Easily, comfortable, and reliable",1
My wallet was stolen my family account was downgraded due to the card not going through. I updated with the new card and resumed my family account. They would not let the other members of my family join because it had not been 12 months since they first joined. After an 1 5 hours with 3 agents the best they could do was to tell me they could join again in December (7 months). That is insane! It is the same people in the same household we just had to change payment! What a scam!! Canceled acct.,0
You can't play the song you search for ðŸ˜’ because it shuffles your music ðŸŽ¶,0
"Its a good app but when it says ""Enjoy your next 30 minutes and then when 1 or 2 or 3 songs in it starts playing ads please fix this :) Thanks!",1
"I absolutely hate this app now. You took away everything i loved about it, I can no longer loop the songs nor can I play a song when a different song is playing. I updated it and that is not the issue. I HIGHLY do NOT recommend this WHATSOEVER.",0
"Amazing app, no problems with it whatsoever but I would appreciate a way to sort you Playlist by artist or by name just to make it easier to find songs",1
"I love this app, the ads kinda are annoying but that's fine. One problem though. I have perfect internet, everything else works on my phone, except for Spotify. Nothing is opening, it is stuck on loading, I deleted and downloaded it, now I can't even sign in",0
all good with Spotify,1
"I'm an Indian and when I listen to hindi songs,,,, what the HECK!!!!! why are the lyrics in ENGLISH AND NOT IN HINDI?!?!?! PLEASE , SHOW THE LYRICS OF THE SONG IN THE LANGUAGE IT IS SANG!!!!!!!!! WHY SO MUCH ENGLISH?!?! PLEASE ADD THIS FEATURE, OTHERWISE THIS app is great... though it contains too many ads but that's fine ðŸ˜",1
Somg selection is great i work in low cell service areas and wants to look for service before opening my saved song which takes away from point of saved songs super annoying please fix,0
Love this app ... I can find all the music I like and its really easy to make play lists ...,1
Good song picks but hope the sound quality will be at par with Tidal in the future nevertheless sound quality is good. It also lacks EQ to make songs a bit of your personal tuning.,0
Always good and easy to use.,1
Best streaming online music app.,1
Cool and easy app to use,1
"It's a really great app, understanding price for the premium package, mostly on time for new and latest music. âœŒ",1
The app keeps bugging and it suddenly closes after a song is over when I leave the app.. Also there are too many adds... Please fix these issues.. Else I'll have to move to some other app,0
"_outdated UI _Can't customise Homescreen, it's all sposored or suggested content _Artist list items are too big (requires extensive scrolling, even worse on desktop apps) _Can't browse by genre or year of release _Suggestions are the same thing over and over again _can't filter remasters and live versions from new releases At least the music availability is not too bad.",0
Battery consumption is very disappointing. Music app should be well optimised because music is not a thing people play for while and done. Majority and in my case I listen music all day while work in office. With Spotify this is quite hard for me to last phone battery for day. For reference I used tidal and deezer. I never had this issue. New to Spotify and this thing is bad.,0
"Spotify has just completely stopped playing any songs at all... full signal on my phone, I started a song & let it sit for over 30min with not a single sound or a second played... I'm NOT happy.",0
"Take off those stupids ads, can't listen to 1 song without watching an ad for 1 minute straight.. stupidness..so hungry for money there's no such thing as customer satisfaction anymore.",0
Ever since they updated the app iv had nothing but issues. Getting kicked out of the app. Now when I play music or podcasts the bar disappears to pause or fast forward. Spotify doesn't try to fix. Ugggh,0
Very bad. Can't preview song.,0
"Once again, spotify is no longer finding amazon alexa devices connected. A regular and persistent fault.",0
Your song recommendations sucks and ads sucks as well. Booooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Spotify won't let me log in on my Facebook account and it keeps restarting by itself everytime I log in Why is that happening? Please fix it, Thank you.",0
hi there's a problem with my spotify sometimes the song playing will not show up although audio is playing in the background. I would have to exit the app and reenter for the bug to stop. please fix ! thanks,0
Easy to use and a large selection of music to choose from. Great wxperience.,1
"Auto plays every time Bluetooth is connected, takes over alarm clock ring. Extremely presumptuous to assume I want that all to happen without me telling it to do that. Uninstalled, this app sucks Ill never use it again",0
This app is so stupid. What's the point of letting people be able to make playlist but only aloud to listen to like 5 seconds of said song,0
Spotify on PC is better since there aren't as many limits on mobile as on PC.,0
Needs internet to play downloaded songs. Shuffle hasnt worked since 2017. Ads after paying monthly. Spotify - 'We added blue check marks!!!',0
"Its so good apk! I can play whatever Songs in there its either j ,famous songs, 90's",1
It wouldn't go past the loading screen even after trying to restart my device and uninstalling and reinstalling the app.,0
If I turn my screen off. The app will randomly pause mid song. Might as well be playing music through YouTube. Only reason I won't delete this garbage app is because of Joe Rogans show,0
My playlits are all empty but on my ipad they are all there help me plss,0
My opinion is to play a ad every 1 hr rather than playing ad for every half an hour,0
I really enjoyed this listening to all my favorite songs and also very easy to access. Thank you Spotify ðŸ˜Š ðŸ’“,1
"Brilliant and easy, I have mixed dementia and my music is a very important part of my life",1
Pp on Llol L,1
The experience was great but the prices change from an area to another and it's cheaper in other places,0
Love Spotify for listening to music new and old. Plus I really am into podcasts now. Spotify got me hooked. There is so much selection to choose from. I'd highly recommend paying for premium it's soooo worth it.,1
Good,1
ITS VERY BAD LIKE DONT EVEN PAY IT I PAYED SPOTIFY A LOT JUST TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND NOW THAT I QUIT GIVING IT MONEY IT JUST STOLE IT THERE AINT EVEN OPTIONS WHERE YOU CAN DISABLE THIS LIKE FR SPOTIFY? YOU JUST TOOK MY 149 PHP WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME i want refund spotify pls reply to this i could spend all that money to buy me some food :( also premium sucks why wont it let me change plans? or cancel them? pls fix this,0
"Good. I always like the app. But the reason I gave 4 stars, coz of the ads. They are too much ads that force for premium pls give a minimun of those. Otherwise its fantastic",0
"Love the app, only wish it had playback speed like YouTube has, a good few songs that I ha e sound a lot better at a certain speed. How this could get fixed in the next update please and thank you.",0
New ui is just getting worse. I can no longer pause or stop playback without forcing app to quit ...,0
Found more of what I wanted to hear with Spotify than any other app.,1
GREAT,1
Love Spotify but the app is kinda glitchy when using Bluetooth devices. Sometimes it takes a long time to recognise my bt headphones/speaker and I also experience sharp hiccups occasionally during songs which doesn't happen when I'm using other music apps,0
Stop just go and download boomplay a much better app But just to support Barcelona download it but never use it Use boomplay or something else just download but don't use,0
Had it for years reliable streaming app,1
Spotify is the best for me. I have everything that I can listen to and enjoy. No problem yet,1
"Edit: dropped 1 star because now the rewind, pause forward contact pannel is completely gone. I have no control over the podcast. Latest version, reset do not help ðŸ‘Ž While I am on a playlist, I cannot switch to random mode. It ends the current song and starts over. Puts me back 20 years in time. Glad that not back to stone age.",0
"Great App. Leave Rogan alone. Also it would be nice to manipulate the speed of songs, not just podcasts.",1
"Fast setup was listening to my favorite music in literally seconds !! Good work keep it up!!!! ,,,,,music videos would be cool !!!",0
"So, my spotify doesn't want to play my music and it's downloaded but when I click on it, silence.",0
Issues where screen goes to sleep and now app doesn't play music and now suddenly stops or when you hit play it doesn't. The longer I have had the app the more issues I experience,0
This app is awful.. I used to love it but it has recently stopped working. I can't do anything on it and there is not way to fix it.,0
Everything is good but why are there many much many songs unplayable??? Make them available please If u r in India them least recommended app cuz most of artists are unavailable to play,0
"So damn good, but the ads are too much if u dont buy premium, like 3-5 ads",0
Why the hell did they remove the log in with phone number option in mobile app?! I literally have a play list with 140 songs now how the hell can I get back to them.......,0
I wish in the premium duo there is a chat session too!!... Which we can communicate each other easily i wish this update come up soon.,0
Awesome app for music,1
User interface is confusing. It's hard to search for podcasts by category. Cannot turn cellular streaming off independently.,0
"Spotify bring back the example of the song when your adding songs to playlist, unless you know what song your looking for you can't hear it unless you search the song up & actually play it each time. I'm paying for this premium I expect better not backwards!!",0
"Well worth paying for premium service. I'm listening to something I never believed that I will again, old favorites and remembering my favorites from my younger age. Thanks.",1
Great music in my opinion,1
"Cancellation is purposely designed to be very hard. There is no direct link, even when you get to cancellation, you have to go through 3-4 screen, each screen giving you an impression that it's cancelled. However there is a tiny button at the bottom which usually you have to scroll to see, because their offers take most of the screen space. They do con people into paying another month of subscription, however they lose lifetime business of someone like me.",0
"I would have given it 5 star, but it didn't deserve that after this update. This update wont let you play thr songs in order what you searched. I didn't like that feature. Pls fix this.",0
"I liked the way it was before, I seriously hate the bew update for it, it's absolutely awful. I miss how Spotify was like a months ago. I wish they didn't update it",0
I like this all music song that you like they play with it,1
"Music app that is easy to listen to and fun, I've been using this app for a long time and so far I haven't had any problems. Premium options are really profitable if you is a true music listener!",1
The best best song app,1
I've had Spotify for years. Best platform for saved music and custom playlist. My fav part as a fan of sound quality. I set mine on extremely high quality for great sound especially if you play loud,1
The best app for listening high quality music and variety of songs,1
Best music app there is nothing comes close to it,0
"Ok it's a good service with most songs firstly. It glitches a bit so the devs probably don't know: -I often hear songs I've heard before on discover weekly -Spotify has issues figuring out what playlist it's on after starting up on PC. -Far too many remixes are recommended. -Equalizer was added, then removed. I miss it. -BPM info for better playlists -Sincerely from a Spotify subscriber of 5 years",0
Good,1
I should be able to listen to my music in the way i sort it.,1
It's very great from ganna... ðŸ˜ðŸ¥° and ganna is waste ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®,0
The app just doesn't open. I pay the premium but I'm having to use spotify lite because this version is not opening,0
"Pointless me writing what's wrong with it because everyone else is having the same problem with it not allowing you to change songs,pause,play or just crash. Instead of asking what you can do better sort it out as we are telling you and paying for a service which isn't working.",0
Best music experience ever,1
Reliable app with great music. Practically listening 24/7. Premium is a must.,1
Bruh u need to fix shuffle. My Playlist is a day long and I hear the same hour of music. Shuffle is useless if it still plays in the same order,0
"Music will sometimes keep playing after disconnecting from Bluetooth, but the Now playing disappears. I'll have no way of pausing and will be forced to force close.",0
Easy to use. Great custom playlists,1
Recent update has made the app very buggy. Crashes a lot and the play bar won't show up,0
"Its been so nice to use Spotify. Everything is just fine except the fact that we cannot change our username. I really wish we could, it would be really very convenient so please put this feature so change usernames.",1
Suddenly I can't play any song past the 00:09. Fix this please,0
Its good very good all tho my account isnt leting me log in.Why?I tap my account and then loads for five sec and says try again. Same with my other email.Fix it so i can listen again,1
"I downloaded this app, started using it,it was fun but after few days, songs I liked ain't playing anymore.",0
"This app is hot garbage. It stops working or just does whatever it feels like doing, constantly crashes on both of my newer samsung phones. Poor integration with my Toyota radio.",0
Random crashes when playing in the background,0
Very good listening experience,1
Love it. I can find whatever I want 99% of the time,1
"Awesome... Sometimes it has turned on by itself, Rock On",1
This is the best app I found on Google Play store for Music. I could give 5 stars if you increase the no.of skips per hour.Overall this is good. Well done.,1
Good sound quality good price any songs very good,1
"I love the fast connection to stream music and the UI is beautiful ðŸ˜ Allow to swipe a song to ""add to queue""",1
"great app, I have premium and love the offline listening. Really enjoy being able to make my own playlists",1
Ghatiya bhangar,1
"there's a new update that i absolutely hate. when u want to add more songs to ur playlist, u can't hear the lil snippet of the song like u used to. that rlly gets on my nerves bc i don't want to go search up the song on YouTube before adding it to my playlist. please change it back. i also have a free account, but if this has become just a premium feature, then im deleting Spotify. this update angers me a LOT. also, why five ads in a row after every two songs?",0
"Something is going wrong. The app want wiring yesterday. It'll start playing songs then stop and not restart. So I closed Theo app and relaunched it and it'd just stop again. So I made sure it was updated, cleared data and cache, then I uninstalled and re-installed and now it will not even open.",0
"Great app, gives you exactly what it says it will! The ads aren't too ridiculous when you don't have premium, and the song choices are great! I will say, I wish they had a bit more from smaller creators, but I'm sure that's something that will come with time.",1
Its the best app for music,1
Since the last update this morning my music is breaking up and upsetting me frequently. It used to be my only lovely company prior update and never let me down. I am a premium user.,1
Hi to all of you music lovers and the creators. To the second ones why are you getting so lazy in some of the trucks u come a cross some songs have only 2 words some times 4 some of you are getting lame and lazy. To the Spotify who ever you pay for the trucks made like that I wouldn't pay them for being not creative and lazy and counting on easy money. It would be good if you reject such lame songs who are just cra..p,0
I recently purchased Spotify premium and after my subscription was over I canceled it cause I didn't need it anymore but after that it logged me out of my account and won't let me log back in or reset my password,0
Love it!!! Great work out tool also.,1
I love Spotify it's the best app to listen to music,1
Play bar dissappears. When I am playing music there has been a bunch of times now where the play bar has disappeared. I have to close the app to get it to come back. I have so had the app crash. This needs to be fixed please. Thanks,0
"Excellent. I love this platform. It has all the music I used to listen to back in the day. Plus an amazing collection of Christian music. And the podcasts, (which I was unaware were available), are great too I would recommend Spotify. Hours of entertainment.",1
"Can't even play the song we want , you put that shuffle and play what they want you to hear !",0
"I don't know what else is on Spotify, but I sure enjoy listening to Christian music and podcasts.",1
"I listen music anytime. This is the perfect app for people like me. Buy yourself Spotify Premium, it's not a waste. There aren't some song, but it's the best music app ever!",1
It's a very good app. But in new update there are some bugs.. But over all it's a very good app.. I recommend it.try it nowðŸ’šâ˜®.,1
The app crashes constantly when using Bluetooth or just randomly decides to skip an episode of a podcast or song it's very annoying but other than that it's awesome,1
"SPOTIFY ON PHONE SUCKS. ON PC AND ON TABLET, ITS WAY BETTER. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY FREE USERS CAN ONLY LISTEN TO PLAYLISTS AND ALBUMS. I CANT STAND SHUFFLE PLAY. PLEASE MAKE SPOTIFY ON PHONE LIKE ON PC AND TABLET. I HATE SHUFFLE PLAY.",0
I like this app Its good to relax and play games while listening to your favourite songs,1
Good,1
I am getting ad based on my location but I want ad only in Hindi or English is there not any solution for it?,0
"App hasn't worked for the past week, music randomly stopping and no currently playing bar. Lots of others with same issue and no way to contact customer support to ask about suspend account until app is working again",0
I can get the music I like and love to listen to and you guys Are awesome  Thanks for all your work on this app,1
"Fantastic. Premium is worth the money, for sure.",1
Best country music this side of the moon!,1
"Pretty good,the only thing that just has to go is, spotify let people download songs themselves stop putting random songs in a playlist i cant enjoy music and it messes up the whole playlist and experience And i cant delete the songs out of it.",0
"I am always fascinated how people are not grateful and always bitching and moaning about stuff. You literally have an ability to listen to music from all places, times, so easily and comfortably, for a monthly price of a cup of coffee. There will always be minor bugs, ""imperfections"" and stuff. Thank you, spotify,you are a wonder",1
Spotify the best,1
"Great up until a couple of weeks ago. Now the stream will randomly stop. No other apps/browsers open. Just Spotify on its own stopping mid stream, with a solid wifi connection. So irritating!",0
"Absolutley garbage app. So bad. Don't download this on your phone, you are better off using YouTube. This stupid app only allows you to shuffle play your songs. Absolute vile garbage.",0
"Buggy and unreliable. E.g. sometimes I start Sonos music, return to the app not long after and it has no idea music is playing, so hard to stop it. A Sonos speaker that is always on the network sometimes appears in Spotify and sometimes does not (the Sonos app has no problem). Connecting to Sonos speakers is painfully slow. Often I open the app and tap one of the recently accessed items at the top of the home page and just as my finger touches it, it all moves around. And that ugly app icon...",0
"Spotify is a good app to listen to music however it forces you to pay like nothing will function, I'm willing to pay it's not a big deal however my experience wasn't good while I didn't pay so I don't think it's worthy to pay for.",0
The song kept shuffling by itself even though I'm not pressing anything and it is very annoying,0
"Was great, now it switches out of my Playlist and plays random songs it thinks I will like.",1
"I love it! I can't go to sleep without listening to some podcasts or playlists, but there are some issues.First you can just skip 6 songs an hour and it's just annoying sitting there listening to songs you don't even like. Next whenever i try to go to spotify the play and back and forward button are gray and wont even let me touch them, it will also say nothing is playing. Please fix this and no it's not my device because i tried it on others and still dosen't work. Otherwise i really enjoy it.",0
"garbage app, i literally can't subscribe to premium, every time i try to click the ""send pin"" it just says ""oops, something went wrong, please try again or contact our support team"", i tried to subscribe on my laptop, used incognito mode, restarted my phone, used a different browser but nothing worked. I'll just stick with YouTube music.",0
"Cool, stress less, and satisfying",1
"Love the app. Recently it won't find internet. Just this app. Put on just data,just wifi, no I don't have it on offline. Reinstall 3 times ...help",0
I love this app but I want a option for the lyrics of foreign songs to be like The songs in hindi and Arabic to be transliteration. Because I love hindi and Punjabi songs and I wanna read the lyrics but I don't know the language,0
Amazing but missing one of my favourite bands/albums ðŸ˜­ so 4stars until the band Atheist and their album Elements shows up...,0
It is alright its just when you try to play a specific song and it makes you shuffle because i could just go to soundcloud and the problem is fixed,0
This app sucks everytime I play a song it give random bad songs,0
"It is a really great app, I get these studying music and I use it to study and it helps a lot.",1
The Android Auto interface needed the ability to manually search as Google's voice control often fails.,0
Still can't get the lyrics... If I don't get them soon I'll subscribe to apple music,0
some bugs but overall really good listening service !!,1
Great experience ðŸ˜ðŸ˜¸ except the add ðŸ˜ƒ pls try to fix it and reduce the amount of ads,0
Love Spotify! They have all the variety and all the artists any music lover could ask for. I gladly pay for Spotify Duo for my husband and I.,1
There is an awful lot of great music but there is also an awful lot of ads - way to many.,0
"You guys need to fix your stupid updates.....for the past 3 months my downloaded songs keep deleting for no reason and I have enough storage space I've been redownloading everything. playlist, liked songs and all repeatedly.....fix this!!! It's annoying",0
The only negative point is ads This is best music aap and clearly kills all of it's competitors like gaana I had free 6 months gaana plus subscription but i choose Spotify with ads over it,0
You need give premium out for free with no strings attached,0
Worst never download this one U can try resso and wynk and other all but compared to all this is worst . It u didn't take premium membership 24Ã—7 adds i am getting 1min add after one song I request u try resso is better,0
"Flawlessly smooth and simple..... Can I have my ice cream and discount now ?!!!???!! Just kidding, it's true .... The first part.",1
I used to love this app right until I had a ton of problems with.I tried to fix it multiple ways like look for updates or search up on Google the answers but I just gave up and deleted it.,0
I love the app a lot I listen to all my old school music on it,1
Rogan stuff was odd its wont play sometimes and randomly turns off if im not on internet even if playlist is downloaded,0
Best music app available. I have been using them for more years than I care to admit. Lot's of new music and downloading doesn't take 4 hours!!!!!!,1
"Love it, this app is great for creating playlists and finding the music you love. I also Love the ability to download playlists for when you have no internet.",1
"Fantastic, i just love spotify. Enjoying my favorite songs every day.",1
Enjoying it. But the fact that you can't click on artist and just see a list of all their songs drives me crazy. Everything is split up into the albums. I just want an option to see one big playlist of all their music on the artists page.,1
everything costs. And the random songs being added to your playlist is annoying.,0
"Aaah, the glorious synthesis between artists and ears! Hearts and minds across time! Thank you, thank you!",1
"Love spotify, great music and plenty podcasts.",1
"I don't know what happened but when I want to add a music to my playlist that I made, I can hear the music before I add it, and before that, I could. It's really annoying to me and I hope y'all fix that.",0
"Now playlist only can be played, but didnt show the list so i cant skip any song i want to hear. Sometimes i want to hear song i like in the playlist multiple time.",0
"It was so good until the past week, it has been missing the play bar & doesn't want to stop playing so I have to turn off my phone",0
I can listen to BTS and all kinds of songs anywhere and all time thanks to Spotify ðŸ’œðŸ’œ,1
"App is broken, absolute shot, music won't play, when song does start you can't stop it",0
Serves best quality and taste of music .,1
"Buggy as hell. Freezes after an ad. Clean install, cache and data clean cannot make it run. Of ypu cannot write an app that works, don't offer it.",0
The app is good like real good but it would be nicer if I can the language of the lyrics provided......like a translate button,1
Phone app gets confused when you have a tv with spotify and the shows often won't play on the TV.,0
Best music app ever!,1
Best music app there is! Tons and tons of choices! However it has its many glitches and shutdowns,0
For premium service I pay every month I would expect application that is not crashing daily ( multiple devices ).,1
1star,1
What happened to Canvas? The option to activate it disappeared,0
"Been a premium subscriber for years, worth every penny. A new album comes out and it just alerts you, very convenient, easy to use, always awesome",1
"I enjoy listening to Spotify on my mobile device, thank you for such a wide variety of music ðŸŽ¶",1
Its a great app has lots of songs i can listwn to music while bwing on a another app,1
Best music streaming app,1
"I've been a premium user for over ten years and never had a single problem. The last few weeks though, my shuffle option is rotating between the same quarter of a playlist over and over. Each of my playlists have hundreds of songs, and it'll just rotate between maybe a hundred of them. Shuffle is literally all I use, so this not working anymore is basically an app killer for me.",0
Mobile App keeps saying I am offline so I cannot login but I have Internet connection,0
the music i like it.,1
Easy to operate and varity of languages so I can listen any song I like and good quality of sound,1
"Dum dum and I wanted to play a specific song and it gives me a whole random playlist which sucks, at least have a setting or something developers. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ Geez now I have to use YouTube music ðŸŽ¶",0
"I gave it 5 stars. But sometimes hard to update premium especially on mobile device. Please fix this problem, anything but that this app is so awesome and easy to use. Rock onðŸ¤˜ðŸ¼",1
Lots of songs connects to devices witch is really use fullfor me,0
Works fine most of the time,1
App is constantly freezing/unable to play and requires multiple restarts just to function.,0
like the apps but some bug and when u do offline mode music not playing,0
Very adaptiv app Love it thanks,1
I love Spotify soo much,1
I use to love this app but the new update has made it horrible.,0
It's an amazing music app! But there is one big problem qnd it's that the experience isn't really enjoyable without premium which not all people can afford so please make at least 2 of the premium features available for free.,0
"App has glitches, whenever I take a WhatsApp call and I'm connected to my cars Bluetooth it starts playing music while I'm on a call. Seriously needs improvement Every time there is a update there always an issue or bug with the app. The latest version keeps on shuffling songs.",0
Good in general but lots of bugs. Will randomly glitch and stop/start my music on and off for no reason for a few seconds and if i don't tap my screen then it'll stop completely until i do tap my screen,0
Spotify is really good to listen to music and podcast to when u r bored or want to listen to some good tunes,1
"I would give the app a higher rating score but i'm a mobile spotify user and for some reason i cant listen to the songs i want when i create a playlist, i can just listen to a random shuffled song that the app decides to give me to listen to and i think the playlists are broken Also when i do try to listen to my playlist songs and i click on one of them just a small short sample of the song starts playing and not the full version,i just want to be able to listen to the full songs in my playlist",0
App keeps stopping music over and over again for literally no reason,0
"Great music service, the audio is high quality and the app is easy to use. Also very quick and friendly support.",1
Great app for listening music. Idk why but it has greater quality than the ones I listen to in YouTube,1
"Everytime you update the app the widget disappears ðŸ™„...and why does the app keep stopping when I'm playing tracks???? Sick of it, and it's not my WiFi. NO OTHER APP HAS ISSUES LIKE THIS ONE. YOU DO NOT DESERVE MY Â£9.99 A MONTH. I'm going to move to Deezer if this carries on.",0
"Freezes ALLLLLLL the time. I expected more from a ""premium"" audio service",0
"it's insanely bad I wanted to listen to a song but instead it shuffled with other songs,I tried so many tutorials it still won't play what I want it's horrible just fix this and it will be okay.",1
Spotify crashes when used with a Jabra Bluetooth earphones. I uninstalled it. When I reopened and allowed for Bluetooth on Android 12 it just crashed. It will only work again if I disable Bluetooth.,0
Wow just wow. What i like about Spotify premium is that when your connected to the internet and lose or weak signal the music still plays and no buffering. I purposely disconnected from my wifi for like 5mins and my music was still playing. Thank you Spotify now I see why its such a good streaming music app.,1
Its amazing but although you need to be premium to skip the songs and you can only skip 6x for example eleven from ive and another song pops up and skip 6x i have to wait for it to end so please fix it but i love it,1
I've used Spotify for a long time and I'm grateful to all the music and features this app offers.,1
"No idea what last week's update did but nothing works. Drops non-stop, pause button is gone, no longer can skip songs when my phone is locked, had to repair with my headphones. App was fine and now it's barely usable",0
Wonderful app! You can play music offline even without premium. The only problem is that there are too many ads.,1
"Even being a premium user, I'm still contantly logged out for no reason, the app is incredibly slow, and even buggier, to the point of having to close out and restart the app several times just to get to my liked songs. Plus, the way free users are treated on the app is downright insane. It's gotten so incredibly greedy and I can't abide the actions of Spotify. The horrible payout for artists on the app is also just so terrible.",0
The base quality and audio output is superb . I always consider this app to listen music . From me A+,1
Nice app....too many ads lately,0
I really like to listen songs in Spotify the app is truly good for making playlists.,1
Pretty much got everything I look for. Don't know what else to really say. Love making playlists and enhancing them.,1
So amusing to hear music from your site without hustle of too much ad.,1
Pay for the ads and rest is Grace on Spotify! (7/4/22). (12/4/22) now why did you block my account for no reason. I had a premium acc. I lost the trace to all the song I've ever liked.,0
"Overall the app is good but i have a feature request, please add play next for songs and even add to queue for songs because everytime the album needs to be accessed",0
"Been with Spotify for 3 years, now it doesn't connect despite having connection. I tried to reinstall it now and can't download it no more.",0
Too much ads ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”,0
Cant even go to albums after the new terrible update. First rule of software dont fix what isnt broken. Too much worrying about Joe Rogan and not enough on the actual product.,0
"Really good app recomended 100% you can listen to whatever song you want and etc, the only thing i hate about it there stupid and annoying commercials there one in specific that says listen this add for 30 seconds something,something to enjoy 30 minutes of music with no commercials, and then the the song starts playing after the commercial but then not even 10 minunets pass and like 3 adds come up wich is really annoying. So spotify pls work on that, but it is also a really good app so download.",1
"I absolutely love Spotify and I'm obsessed with music, but I only rated it 4 starts for a reasom. Ok so basically my Spotify was doing this weird thing it like had only one song in all my playlist and literally nothing would play, and I had no idea how to fix. And whats weird is that it would work on my other devices with my Spotify account just not on my phone. So it might be my phone but idk. And another thing it does is it just randomly kicks me out of the app sometimes. Well thats all I have",0
Nice,1
Can't sort podcasts by language,0
Used to be Great but now is not. When apps misfunctions one must delete all content to reset. No customer support exists-- just advice from other users. So to get the value of my Premium Subscription I must uninstall to re-install dumping my 1k song library ðŸ˜žðŸ˜“ðŸ˜© 07/22 no change. Review remains valid,0
Spotify mess up for me and won't work. It is so bad ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,0
It's a pretty slick app interface. Music selection has been great and the integration of Sonos control is awesome to have.,1
It's really hard to add songs to a personal Playlist. I can't just look at a list of the artists songs and add it. I click on an album or an artist and its like a detour to add one song.,0
It's a great experience with music,1
"Awesome service. Works seamlessly with my Tesla, Amazon Echo network, and cell phones to give me exactly what I want in music no matter where I am.",1
This app is not working the way it should on Samsung Note 10 Plus.,0
Pls help I can NOT PLAY SELECTED SONG pls all I want is free music,0
Ads are annoying,0
This is the best music app ever,1
"Thank you for adding lyrics. Now you are really the best for me !!! P.S. please, put play button in the middle again, it's very inconvenient",0
Ad volumes varies causing unfortunate listening experiences. Today 5/6 Geico ads had much higher volume so it makes using the app disruptive. Marketers do this on purpose but there should be checks it place to limit this poor experience.,0
My app keeps crashing or is set to offline even though my data is on I wish I could add pictures but one day Im playing music in glorious bliss and the next Im being asked to add music or podcasts Where does my liked music and set lists go And this has happened three times within November and February Ive had to uninstall the app and reinstall I enjoyed it for a few days before my play lists disappear This is just frustrating And Im on premium in case you were wondering,1
"Not to happy. Found out despite having the same plan, I was paying more on my mom's account I was paying for than mine. Canceled our subscriptions.",0
"Excellent availability, I can't say every song can be found but theres more than enough music to go through. Love the improvements concerning lyrics and the overall layout of the platform.",1
"This app is really good! It has actually been helping me out alot with my anxiety,anger,etc! You guys should try it out! It's very relaxing aswell!<3",1
"I've been using Spotify for quite sometime now and I do like, it's not a bad app to say but sometime when I try to pick a song to play I get something completely different and get annoying everytime and I don't know if it's like that or not but I do want to know if it's like it. Aside from that it's a pretty good music app.",1
Good app for music lovers. The quality of tracks are very good and also the collection,1
Spotify is the way...,0
Excellent I can say. Just make sure we have unlimited skips,1
"Lots of glitches lately. Turns off on its own or option for pause, ff, rewind is gone completely",0
I have spotify premium and failed to pay my subscription on time. I was given a few days to update my payment details before my premium expired and hence didnt lose my downloads. Thanks a lot for this!,0
Here some lyrics are wrong but also iam enjoying the music which makes me so pleasant and makes my mood too good.......................,1
FIRE APPS,1
"Easy to use, nice interface, variety of choices",1
2 stars to hopefully get your attention Needs to be debugged. The playing screen doesn't appear. Can't stop it from playing once it's playing. I had to force stop the app in order to get it to stop playing I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling. Did not help,0
why would u guys remove the quick scrolling option from the side?? now I have to scroll manually to the end of my liked songs. PLEASE put it back.,0
I say 4 bec I love this app but I only get to here the songs I already heard over and over sometimes but other than that it is good,1
"With this app, I can listen to music without interruption",1
I absolutely love love loveeee Spotify.,1
"Spotify is ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ if you can't find it here, then sadly ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥ you're probably using Pandora ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£",0
Quite good,1
App doesn't open. Black screen!,0
Support is very helpful.. my linked Facebook was stolen and they helped me with being able to get my Spotify account back and set to the email instead which was the email used for my Facebook before it was stolen.. so very grateful to the spotify support,0
the button is not working,0
For me Spotify is just not working it keeps saying something when wrong it doesn't even let me play the songs I want but it is a good app kind of it was good when I first downloaded it but now it not good,1
Very good experience bt should add more songs for India region,1
Love lyrics were added. Thank you. Easy app to use.,1
Good service but the performance of the app is abysmal.,0
"I like this app very much , but MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT : I THINK IT'S VERY STUPID THAT YOU HAVE TO SKIP TO YOUR FAVORITE SONG AND ALSO THAT YOUR SONG THAT YOU SEARCH IS SHUFFLED WITH OTHER SONGS!!!!!!",0
"Disappointed!! And no, I am not understanding!! Spent over Â£300 on a Pioneer head unit with Spotify connect for it only to work for about a month. Absolute disgrace for the compatibility to be removed! Please sort it out Spotify or at least stop auto updating the app. Spotify still connects to my Pioneer unit when version 8.6.98.900.apk is installed, but only lasts for a few days then stops working as it auto updates even with auto update being disabled for Spotify in Play Store!!! Fix it!!",0
"I throughly enjoy Spotify offline and online. Due to where I live /travel in a rural area, you never know when you'll have have internet coverage. So having the option can allow me to still listen to my music. ðŸ™‚ðŸ‘",1
Awesome app...only one problem..the birds of prey soundtracks haven't been released yetðŸ˜”...please do something bout it,1
I would never pay for premium because I keep having to uninstall and log out of Spotify free because it keeps getting stuck on an ad that is silent and replays over and over. Ugh.,0
It has been acting up on me lately. On my laptop it will show me a black screen and on my phone if I get a notification it will stop playing. And sometimes it won't show the play button when I'm playing a song. But it used to work really well bidk what's up with it now. Please fix,1
The greatest apps I've ever seen.... I love Spotify.....,1
I really cannot keep losing my files and having to download everything over and over again. Twice in a week is enough!!!,0
"Good music app, serves it's function. Song recommendations are decent, the albums are very good, gets the job done but you kinda have to pay for premium to get the proper experience.",0
What is going on with these glitches like the play/pause bar disappearing almost every time when you use the app. Very annoying having to restart your phone 10 times a day.,0
I enjoy the different music that's not easy found and I can do other things,1
Unable to QUIT Premium STOP doesn't work.and there is no way to cancel in the MENU.,1
Trash app if you dont pay. You can't even choose what song you want to play. You literally have no control. Most apps with premium give extra features that feels nice to have. This app feels like an inconplete mess missing essential features and you need to purchase premium for what should be the base app. Honestly I'd rather use radio,0
Best app for young listeners,1
"Rating this as a Premium user, and I love it! They ALMOST have every song I want, and offer sizable podcast interesting contents. My mom is a a free user... and it's a different story. She gets frustrated with limited shuffle and search option. Weighing that slightly in, and the few annoying times they would suddenly change interface, I can't give a solid 5 star.",1
"At first I didn't realize the true purpose of this ""app"" but after using it a while across diferent devices, from a smartwtach to a PS4, with such a great database of songs, I can racomand it to everyone. The one negative thing is the price of the monthly subscription.",0
"Even if it is great on iPad and computer, I can't say the same for my phone. I find it really stupid that I cannot play the song I want and only can play recommend song if I play a playlist.",0
Too much advertising. I keep on adding songs to my Playlist but The total music time does not change.,0
What if: the new notification list turned into a playlist so u can hear them all and add to personal playlist or remove them...,0
I absolutely love spotify I can play any music I want,1
It's the best app ever if you have premium and its really affordable,1
It always says that the app has been stopped in old version of Android in Android Kit Kat 4.4.2 Samsung Tablet also proper always and I open and try to use it is stopped automatically I hate this why it is happening like this I don't understand the app is up to date still whenever I use it automatically it goes to black screen and says app stopped,0
"Well i guess the mixes are good enough ... still prefer if i could play my favs freely tho... you know, like how it was supposed to be...! Plss bring it back plss plss plss.asdasdsdsdssd",0
Good app but it needs to allow Gâ€”paid for buying the premium version,0
Had 4 years premium no issues just good music and good experience,1
"On my old phone (Xiaomi Mi 8), the equaliser worked perfectly fine. Now, on my Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro, it doesn't work at all. Please fix this.",0
New update can't connect/stream Spotify in my pioneer car head unit grrrrrrr!!,0
Hey you guys love you all Like seriously...work is stressful for everyone...everywhere....but you guys...that Playlist u make for us...are so thoughtful...you all make my day better...I love you Spotify team â¤ ðŸ’– ðŸ’• ðŸ˜˜ ðŸ’— â™¥,1
"Just get premium if u can. Even without, the playlists that they make based on your liked songs are usually pretty good. It's better than listing to music on YouTube.",1
"I've found that if I ask for one song by a certain artist, it is followed by a nice playlist that Spotify has put together and I can just listen all day without getting bored!",1
Most of the music of the world you can find. Student deals on premium are a blessing!,1
Really good but the ads are so long,0
"Didn't think I would enjoy spotify, I couldn't have been more wrong. Dr",0
"Keeps bugging out, so after a while I can't hit pause on my progress bar (since its not there). I have to force stop the app then restart what I was listening to to get the progress bar back. Not an update issue and I'm wondering if reinstalling will fix it..",0
Lied about the 30 minutes of ad free music thing,0
"Normally my fav music app, but recently it's been lagging, like I turn on a song (I have premium) and it doesn't show that it's playing so I have to close the app, restart even tho I had opened it for a minute and press play. A lot of my music also randomly turns off in the middle of the song. It also has nothing to do with cache etc, I just wiped it, also just really cleared the data and logged into my acc again, downloading my playlists etc, nothing works. What's happening Spotify?",0
I Just Love It! I like the way Spotify creates playlists specially for me.,1
I hope Spotify will fix the design when it's about to upload to instagram story. The design's horrible enough to look at.,0
Good for listening on headphones!,1
wth.. 2 ads was tolerable but 5??,0
Nostalgic. Spotify reminds me of old school MTV!,0
"I don't even think I need to describe why I'm giving the app 1 star--literally see all the recent reviews. So disappointing. Developers please realize that this may be a big company, but you're losing users in droves for how glitchy the app has become. How do you think anyone will be able to keep their jobs if Spotify stops bringing in a massive amount of their revenue? Idk asking for a friend.",0
"I pay for no Ads and unlimited skips definitely worth it thoughðŸ˜my liked list has almost 2,000 songs so it's definitely worth paying for I hate commercials and if I don't feel like a song I can skipðŸ¥²",1
I can't open spotify. I've reinstalled a lot of time already and nothing.,0
Great selection of music at a reasonable price per month. Only minor grip is sometimes it seems to jump around through my playlist/liked songs.,1
"buggy, play bar doesn't show half the time",0
Its sooooo good to lissin to music,1
Typical scum bag company makes it difficult to unsubscribe. Their algorithm is a waste of time it wont fund anythi g si.ilar to what u listen to.,0
I only installed to listen to one podcast. I got sooo many annoying emails and notifications that I finally got all turned off and now they are promoting garbage.,0
Love this app better than pandora but it's gets annoying when you can't just listen to one album or one song you have to shuffle through a ton. Don't get me wrong most of the time I live the shuffle future it just gets annoying.,0
Been using this app for a while and have had no issues. As of the last week I can't listen to my favorite podcast (DrinkinBros). I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times and no luck. What's up Spotify?!,0
"Can't even unsubscribe it,. I just want it to in subscribe pls.......",0
"Can't prevent from opening personal audio files if it's the only audio player installed. When opening a local audio file the setting to ignore local audio is not only ignored, but turned back on as well. Won't consider renewing my subscription until fixed.",0
"Just put, THE BEST radio form I've listened and had. To have your own playlist at disposal is very satisfying to say the least. Highly recommend it to all to subscribe and try it out. Quite entertaining by far.",1
Most recent update has ruined the app. As others have noted: play/pause disapeers and it cuts in and out on Bluetooth headphones. They need to fix this asap or I will be moving elsewhere.,0
I really enjoy the music and I love the lyrics,1
"They broke spotify again, issue is known, it's been a week FIX IT already ðŸ¤¬",0
Increase the quality of the music. I can't connect this app. The app says that not connected to internet.but I have been very fast internet connection.so repair this problem.,0
Perfect for mind relaxation since there are all range of music from all over the world.,1
It. Has. The. Songs. And. Playlists. I. Love.,1
"Hands down the best Music Streaming App, It would be great if Offline music was Handled in a different way but overall it's a Top Notch Experience! Edit: Spotify asked for a Review Not changing it, Still Hands Down best Music App!",1
I love that in this app you can choose what songs you like and what you like to listen to. This app is great for everyone! I highly recommend to use this as your music streaming app!,1
what does it mean First you say listen 30 minutes of uninterrupted music then after one song you advertise again It would be better if you don't say it that 30 minutes of uninterrupted music,0
I deleted this app it took way too long to fix that little switch you updating it's which is your song I honestly hate this app now I'm sorry but this is just me I could not switch the little thing I looked it up on YouTube and everything this app is way too much,0
Tojhu,1
This is a great app to use for listening to music for free! The only problem is sometimes I'll get like 5 ads in a row. But otherwise 10/10 recommend!,1
The app is good but playing songs sometimes I difficult,0
I logged out and now it won't work at all,0
Amazing app ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ all songs quality amazingðŸ‘,1
Spotify is letting Meghan and Harry call the shots to what we can listen to. If it gets worse I am canceling my subscription.,0
It's pretty good but most of the time it doesn't have almost all the song in it so far as I can tell but still good,1
I have chosen artists and type of music I like and Spotify plays whatever it chooses. Why did I choose?,0
An excellent experience - streets ahead of Amazon music. Just waiting for voice control,1
"Randomly loose control panel at bottom to control music/podcasts. Can't choose songs from playlists,, podcasts, radio etc. Rending the app useless. Only solution I have found is to clear cache every time the issue arrises",0
I must say this app is the Best thus far & ever FR ðŸ™ŒðŸ¾ thank you guys so much for all the hard work you guys put in it!!!,1
"The app is great, however there are a few issues: Shuffle is just horrible. I have a ""mega list"" that I mainly use and it constantly plays the same 50-100 songs. I have to continually go through the list to listen to different songs. Playlist sorting is also terrible, can't do any custom arranging (that saves). The only other issue I have is the 'Fans also like' section, I feel like it should also have a better selection of related artists. Premium member, just wish it was more for the $.",0
Literally the only application I can personally say to have enjoyed completely without any major problems.,1
"Good app but it has some issues with songs randomly fading in and out. Not sure why this happens, but still really enjoy.",1
canvas feature doesn't work anymore,0
love spotify and the recommended playlist!,1
I love it,1
"Annoying popup requesting to allow Bluetooth cannot be hidden permanently, just ask later option, which isn't a choice at all. Looking at moving to Deezer.",0
This app is the best but it should start playing another song after the one is finished which we searched for. It should not just stop.,0
Amazing but some times doesn't show the bar of current playing I have to shut down the app and launch it again to see that bar.,0
Spotify has the potential of being the best music app ever but they only want money and you add ads between almost ever 3-4 songs?? Not to mention u cant take off shuffle or listen to individual songs on mobile but can only do it on TV or laptop which is ridiculous.,0
"Love it!! Has any and all my old Rock favorites, Like Frank Marino, and Pat Travers, as well 90's Grunge.",1
App has many bugs in it. Music randomly stop. The banner to play pause or change song doesnt always appear so there's no way to stop music unless you close the app..,0
"This app is like a CD Walkman from way back when... It skips SO MUCH. Skipping only seems to happen when my phone is locked. Sort it out Spotify ðŸ¤˜ Since last update also now the ""now playing"" thing is missing so I can't skip songs. Only have playlist view :(",0
Great app has all of my favorite music choices,1
"I use Spotify almost daily. However lately it refuses to play several podcasts that I listen to. I've closed the app, I've restarted my phone. Nothing works. I can't listen to the podcast on the Spotify website because it just redirects me to the app.",0
Fav music streaming platform The adds r getting too annoying thoðŸ˜€,0
"please fix the Bluetooth connection problem with car audio systems, I've tested this on a few vehicles now and when I return to vehicle turn back on and go to play music, it's saying it's playing but there's no sound... have to close and open again for it to work.",0
Excellent record choice and it's so easy to set up your play lists,1
"Very good free and premium service, well done Spotify",1
Spotify is great but the recent update has been making my app all funky on my phone. Still love the services just wish the app wouldn't crash as much.,0
"Lately its not playing properly, It stops randomly everytime. Know that I have spotify for years now",0
Wonderful and easy to use music app,1
I regret updating it only way to listen to your music is to let your playlist be on shuffle the old version was definitely betterðŸ¥±,0
"I love it, its just that when i bought premium it started to kick me out of the app at random times. Just kicked me out without warning and shut all the music off, please tell me this is gonna be fixed? Edit: one month later, an update happened, installed, but didnt fix the crashing problem. I guess it isnt getting fixed.",0
"Doesn't work as well on an Android (it was far better looking and more functional on my mother's iphone), but it is nice nonetheless. I was able to take a 3 month free trial which has already made it better for me, so I do not have any major complaints. I would just recommend fixing the functions when installed without the Premium deal on an Android.",1
Its has been an awesome App..smooth and easy access to any kind of music,1
"Best app best audio quality. There are little adds but I ignore. But there is a problem sometimes when I listen songs it automatically comes to home screen. And please try to show lyrics in all the songs. And also I like some songs and at the next day it shows me the song is unavailable. And please try to romanize the lyrics of Korean, Spanish, French and Japanese songs. Please try to fix these problems otherwise the app is awesome ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œ",1
Garbage app for sure i was listening to my my fav playlist but why tf did a different song played i did even favorite it and when i tried to change it there was something that showed that i should try spotify premium why tf am i gonna waste money on just listening song fk you devs trash app this should be deleted from playstore,0
"Adds adds adds ... I don't Like It , i avoid. ðŸ¥´ðŸ™ðŸ» But Adds Likes Me ðŸ˜ . I can't Avoid.. ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜–ðŸ™ðŸ»ðŸŒ¹",1
Best aap to listen music,1
It's really frustrating when there is an option but it doesn't work. I have turned autoplay off and it still autoplays in my car. Really disappointing.,0
"Great app, you can listen to your favourite music with just a single tap.",1
Bug that makes the app unusable at times: it will say there is no internet connection when my phone has full bars and other apps work just fine. Have uninstalled multiple times. Android version 11.,0
It is a good app the only flaw is that I can not download any songs,1
Loved the selections and library mode.,1
Amazing!! I love Spotify!,1
"Gone from good to Poor!! use to rate this app but all it does is pause my songs after every 10secs, done everything to stop this form happening by changing my data setting, battery settings, force stop, clear cache, uninstall to reinstall, login out and back in and turn phone off and back on but still the issue still there, sort it out Spotify!!! Done my side, now do yours!!",0
Very beautiful! It has related to songs I heard and had in the 1970s that are no available around me in Africa.,1
Great app and excellent library! I have a Spotify link in my app airplay.app that navigates to your web app to promote your wonderful service for free! I hope that is okay? Some free marketing for you.,1
I would like a better quality audio streaming format than MP3 320 KBPS. And a native equalizer of the application.,0
"I love the content and accessibility! It bugs me that not all (even we'll known multi-platinum selling) artists music are featured here. I get it, I'm sure it's a business thing. I also wish they did more to source underground/ up and coming content. I hate the fact that I cannot download music or instrumentals not even samples from the base platform. If so I cannot see an easy way to do it. A button would be nice also an off button. Why is it I have to close the entire app just to shut it off?",0
Ita good but the ads are annoying and long,0
"Syncing Galaxy Watch 4 with Spotify Playlist.....not consistent whatsoever. App on watch does not recognize that songs have already been downloaded, app crashes and when controlled by phone is slow to react. The app needs drastic improvement for functionality.",0
"I used to love this app. It was the only place I got my podcasts and music but recently it either stops whenever it wants to or it won't stop without me uninstalling it. It also starts to play a playlist then plays a random song not on any of my playlists?!?! I have a premium account and am seriously thinking about cancelling it, it annoys me so much! Sort the problems Spotify!!! It can't just be me?!?!",0
"Was fine until like 6-9 months ago. Music player keeps disappearing, so I can't pause or skip through tracks correctly. This sometimes causes the music to stop randomly as well. Really frustrating. Using Samsung s10e",0
Cool for a while got hella ads after 2 songs 4 ads will play but overall good music choice but rather go to SoundCloud or YouTube before,0
SHAKE IT,1
GREAT,1
"Good app, but at times the app does not respond to sibling. Ie does not recognize watch",0
Very Good,1
"The App basically never works. Downloaded songs don't play, it loads forever even with good connection and songs randomly skip, pause or don't play at all. Please fix this application because I'm very close to switching to a different service.",0
"I think Spotify is a high-quality app and if you are looking for a high-quality music app this is the one. you can like songs, make playlists and enjoy. P.S follow me on Spotify",1
"spotify please let people with the normal version enjoy music and stay happy with the basic functions you provide just like any other app does. i can't play songs and even the playlists look different, whenever i click on a song it gives me a preview and won't let me play it and only works normally when i've connected it to my laptop and only plays on shuffle. pls fix this. not everyone can afford premuim and you shouldn't be forcing anyone to buy it by taking away most of the basic functions.",1
"I love Spotify and pay premium but the interface and bugs have been driving me crazy. Song stops playing, no display into for music, widget doesn't work, can't skip or repeat song and so many other issues. Please fix. Thank you!",0
I enjoy it. It is the best music app ever.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,1
Suddenly my subscription is not renewing and it says that i'm not eligible anymore to my plan. What's with that?,0
If I could rate the app 0 stars I wud.Since the last update ive had nothing but probs. There is no hot keys at the bottom so I can't see what I'm listening 2 let alone skip/pause/turn shuffle on or of.There is nothing in the drop dwn notification bar or on my lock screen.So if I want 2 change song I hav to go into the app and pic one.If I want to stop music I hav 2 shut the app down. Now it stops playing randomly can be every 20ish seconds.Sumtimes it starts again other times I hav 2 restart app,0
Changed rating from 5 to 1 star. Use to be my ONLY app to listen to podcasts and music. They chose disinformation. Not only that but every other song its 3 to 4 ads. BS. Think nobody will notice the landslide of ads.,0
bruh why it gotta be so complicated to choose a single song to put in a playlist. no i don't wanna like all the songs in the entire radio??? just let me pick the single????,0
The bestest app for songs ever ðŸ¤ª,1
"Wonderful, ideology ads a bit much",1
"Works fine. As long as Spotify is home of JR podcast, I'll be subbed",1
"Newest update constantly pauses anything I'm listening to, media bar gone so no control. App is barely usable",0
App constantly freezes and loses internet connectivity on my Samsung Galaxy S21 plus,0
"Left YouTube premium for Spotify as per the recommendation of a friend and all I can say is, that was a very bad decision. The music stops like 5 times within a single track for no reason at all. Uninstall, reinstall.. did nothing. Please fix it. All the hype makes no sense if you're chasing your customers out and scaring potential customers with all the negative reviews here.",0
I still Love it. Especially now that they have lyrics added on.,1
"Hi Spotify, been weeks since I update it to new version... Its always lagging when sellecting the music. Its different case on my tablet what happen and can this issue be fixed?",0
App is getting crashed everytime opening it on Vivo t1 plz fix it?,0
"Very inspirational music, spirit lifting as well",1
Spotify is great and good to listen to music,1
What's wrong with spotify these days?,0
Very good i like Spotify,1
"Spotify allows podcasts to ""insert ads"" (full ads outside inserted outside of the episodes like ""songs"") AND the play bar doesn't work anymore. DO NOT PAY FOR PREMIUM",0
"A very amazing app , helped me discover a lot of new artists and listen to some of my favourites.â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ ... But please add the option to disable the lyrics tab ... it's seriously disruptive ... I like to listen to the music and figure out the lyrics by myself and at the same time I like to look at the album arts .... and at that point the lyrics tab comes in.. please just add an option to disable it",1
I love it It so easy and amazing,1
I don't understand how they release an app update to literally millions of people with so little QA. Most recent update is a buggy mess.,0
the app no longer works. when I sign in my Playlists are empty and any single song I play just won't load. As soon as I logged into the app it IMMEDIATELY started deleting all of my offline downloads. UPDATE: as of June 10th My problem hasn't fixed and many other people are having the EXACT SAME PROBLEM!!! And for people looking for a fix there isn't one... yet.,0
Pay for premium. Removes ads on playlists. Does not remove ads on podcasts.,0
"It's not working, the app can't open!!",0
"This is my favorite music apps, i hope we get light mode not just dark mode",1
Was brilliant but later very glitchy. Had to uninstall and re-install several times plays when phones off...won play when I want other times. Getting sick of it now,0
I would give this 5 stars but when I make a playlist it has an annoying we added and i hate it because i hate all those songs and there is no way to get rid of them so if you fix it i will change my review and also i get ads every 5 min so can you lower the ads to like 1 every 10 min pls also they have alot of songs but there little MEME songs so it's difficult to have a laugh just change the we added and I'll give you a 5 star rating and reccomend this app to my friends,0
The new update is not the best it doesn't let u listen to the music u like,0
to many ads like way to many ive had it go from ad to song back to and ad you honestly need premium to enjoy your music sadly,0
Pretty nice but ads are not nice i have to take premium and its pretty irritating also,0
"Just the best way to stream music, I use other apps to find music I love listern then open & save it in spotify brilliant.",1
You know why,1
App doesn't even open! Uninstalled it and re downloaded it and nothing still not working !,0
I can't listen to the song I want without listening to 100 other songs because it shuffles so much. I stopped using spotify.,0
Delivers all our music and podcast requirements,1
"It doesn't work well on my Roku TV, so I cast it from my phone.",0
I listen to Spotify everyday since 2015 and haven't had a problem yet. Only thing I would you another platform for is music that is not on Spotify (unreasted music and sound cloud rappers),0
The sound turns off even though it shows the song is being played.,0
"Love this app! Plays in the background easily, but alot of ads... Get one every two songs! And I have a lot of songs in my Playlist. So if you guys can put less ads would be really good!",0
Great music. Easy to navigate.,1
"I don't like the update....I don't know if it my phone me or the update but I can't see the song at the bottom anymore, I can't click on it....so I can't really skip to the next without scrolling through the entire list and finding the song or hitting shuffle to get a different song..is this normal?",0
"So far I love , Spotify, all other music apps aren't worth using , really , yes",0
I love spotify only thing is having to pay if you want unlimited skips and to listen offline i think $10.00 is worth it if you have the money. I will recommend spotify to friends and family.,1
World best music player ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œâ¤â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤lovely app for music,1
"its always crashing, its so annoying at the same time",0
Perfect for me best music app I love how much I can save and have on hand online or not.,1
"so many bugs!! sometimes i can't even search any songs even though there's a connection, it always says ""go online"" EVEN THOUGH I'M ONLINE.",0
So many great albums and music being released all the time but I don't find it until months later because yall cannot put it into recent releases?? Why??? Why do you want me to listen to some trash dance music from drake but when a upcoming star like trapland pat releases yall can't even SHOW ME it. I'm boutta switch to YouTube music fr yall making me miss out on too much,0
Sometimes it just loops through the same songs over and over,0
I like Spotify but the app sucks constant updates and it never works right,0
An awesome app. I am glad I came across and installed it. Only thing is I am unable to download my favorite songs for offline listening,0
Darn Spotify really need a undo button for accidentally unliked a song!!!,0
"Excellent app. Love the music variety to listen to. Not having app issues.ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ *(edit) this last update is bad, I need to hear 3 ads before I GET a chance to hear a random song, yeah you heard it right (a random song) because it doesn't let me listen the one I want, if I am lucky I can listen to that song after 6 skips. It shuffles the songs. Total stars goes down to 2 ðŸŒŸ.*",0
"The app on my chromebook is super glitchy. If I let it play at the end of a podcast episode, it almost always skips ahead two episodes instead of going to the next one. Sometimes it skips to the next episode after an ad in the middle of the current one. And can we NOT have to listen to an ad again just because we back up the episode a little right after the ad finishes? That's really aggravating. It also freezes a lot. Youtube does that right.",0
It is ok but you can't choose what you want to listen to unlike the PC version,1
The songs are amazing  ,1
Incredible and babies pop in outside your house and you can do the best jaba impression.,1
"I download all the music I enjoy, music I could'nt find anywhere .ðŸ‘ðŸ‘",1
I had an excellent experience. Love the Reggae music. They are my mood and fitness companions.,1
"Big bug. Play bar will disapear while playing, then user can't stop play the song??? Make the price a big joke.",0
Recent updates ruined it. 5 ads for every 3 songs,0
Need to add the possibility to recognize a song. Be clear on what you want to update,0
Don't use the paid version. Lots of adds. But good line up of music.,1
"Well I used to like spotify ,but now I can't even listen to my own playlists whenever I go to listen it plays a random song I've never played before and when I get rid of every recommended song it still plays random songs its annoying and I've just started using YouTubes picture in picture mode for music",0
Best music service,1
Crashing a ton since the new update Edit has stopped crashing,0
I can hear kpop songs all day on Spotify It's such a nice app,1
"Whenever I want to play a particular song,it supposed to play another song instead of one",0
There were lyrics in almost every song and I could find exactly what I was looking for 15/10,0
"Selection is awesome , have had to uninstall / Install a couple times with the loss of phone downloads ,zero human support",0
"Pretty much unusable unless you have Spotify premium, 4-6 ads every 3 songs, plays random songs that you've never seen in your life even though you clicked your ""liked"" playlist, I'd rather pirate music and risk getting arrested",0
"Very dissapointed. I ve been a member of Spotify since a few years and i always been absolutley pleased with them, but since a month my release radar is flooded with fake artist accounts, using artist names to promote their own music (which i dont like their music). I pay for Spotify, but i do not wanna pay for fake accounts by unknown artists. If Spotify doesn't fix this problem i will have to find me a new music platform. Sorry",0
"I have had many music apps, and this one is the best one available, I love it and will keep it as long as they can put up with me. ðŸ˜‰",1
Randomly drops connection and app crashes,0
"Very good choice of music, I like the story behind the songs, unfortunately not available for every song yet. Like the lyrics, if you're into karaoke.",1
Works but feels rough and clitchy. Unbelievable that such a big brand like Spotify cannot make an app thats well intrgrated with a premium android device. This should be a AAA title. I'm using GalaxyS20 and constantly have issues with simple stuff. Like pausing the music or controlling the app through galaxyBuds. Often freezes and music stays playing in the background with no way of turning it off other than hard closing the app. AndoidAuto experience is even worse.,0
AMAZE,1
I play the song my app Spotify crash he is not working please help I love this app please help,1
Everytime I try to play a playlist that has a low number of songs in it just adds random songs I don't want to listen too.,0
Buggy to the point of unusable. Podcast plays but all the player functions randomly disappear so there is no way to pause or control the play without stopping the app and starting over. Maybe you should spend money on a functional player rather than buying Joe Rogan.,0
"Frustrating app. Seems to get worse on a semi-monthy basis. I've been using it for about 4 years + now. Great selection has kept me there but the app constantly having problems and ruining podcasts listening will likely move me towards another platform. Still, the best selection. But what's the point when the app can't play them. You'd think with all the money brought in and it being they're only real business that they would have a more seamless operation for actually listening.",0
Old version is good,1
Genres for liked songs section side bar swipe that allows you to listen to more of your genres that you have to listen to won't work.,1
"Poor, music stops randomly , bar dissapears, what's going on??? Think it's time to look at rivals",0
I download podcasts at home on Wifi and when I get to work to play them it makes me redownload almost all of them via Data. What's up with that? My building blocks out connection so I can't just listen via Data either. Also the app consistantly has problems loading my downloads playlist when I am not connected to internet. Why should this be problem when the podcasts are downloaded?,0
"I like spotify, its kinda unique with its music selections and how it works. Great app!",1
"Loved Spotify until the latest update - now refuses to play a majority of the time without a reboot. Much more skipping and freezing than before. Please undo the latest upgrade, shopping around for a replacement",0
"Spotify Is a well know world famous app, so i dont have any problems but I have a small suggestion that we can also download songs free without premium and also in the new 2022 update there is symbol of download in our playlists too....",1
"Spotify has definitely gone downhill in who it promotes and the type of content available. As a black woman, I don't feel as if this app or its company are inclusive or positive.",0
Their capacity to suggest music based on favorites and song content is great. I never give reviews. Why should I? But this service has very good value. They now have lyrics. Whoa! Horsepower. Earthpower. Seapower. Just float along.,1
"There is a problem that in notifications, album art of a different song is shown when music is playing.",0
"Why won't my Playlist restart? I keep starting my Podcast so I can draw stuff but then it'll start in the middle of a song and it'll completely throw off the mood, Why won't it restart the playlist instead of picking some random song to start in and then play that song and not let me to skip",0
"Plays the same Youtube commercial 3 times in a row, does not play any other commercials then plays the same 4-6 songs in a row. I have to change the station to listen to a different song, if I skip... It goes back to the same song.",0
"I'm having trouble downloading songs for online use. It's like i don't have premium features , if unlimited skips are the only thing I'm paying for then what the hell am i still doing on spotify. That's just one of the problems offered by this update, sometimes my music even cuts mid-play which is irksome to say the least. Please fix this.",0
Best app I have ever seen Yes there are always some pros and cons Like it has my things like we can create our own playlists even they also make new playlists for us but it also has advertisements..which I can say is valid cause we don't take the subscription so it's fine but one thing I just want to highlight is please add the shuffle feature so we can shuffle our songs it's kinda boring to listen the song in same orderðŸ˜Š,0
One of the best music streaming out there!,1
Much appreciated for the suport Keep up the good work Cheers ,1
I love that I can use this app for music and podcasts on my phone or my laptop. So easy to use.,1
Nice app for listening songs,1
Ive had Spotify since 2016 and all I have to say it's an amazing app time capsules yearly playlists personalised playlist ðŸ‘Œ,1
I was in shower while listening to rap music then the song changed and put a Morgan Wallen song on which is country music they need to fix the song chooser but besides that I love spotify. I had the app at 3 star because of my first encounter with country music then I went to my liked songs shuffled them and received Taylor swift I have now deleted spotify and will never download it again.,0
Love Spotify. It soothes my soul because l lifting up the name of Jesus with all of the different artist l listen too.,1
It's a really great experience to have premium but sometimes the app don't open and it shows me an error that the app is not responding and I have to uninstall and reinstall it again.,0
better,1
"Sometimes it just stops playing my music and I didnt pause it, or it glitches out. Otherwise no other complaints.",0
"The most advanced music streaming platform out there. Just wish you guys would let us buy music so I can always have it, if the end of the world happens ðŸ˜†",0
Giving you five stars but I need the free version. It's not fair where I can't listen any songs as I wished. You wished 5 stars I give you guys. Thank you.,0
I loved this app......... until the app added songs to your playlist.Like... I made a playlist because that's what I like to listen to. STOP RUINING GOOD APPS FOR ME!!!!!,0
It's annoying how I have to be online to be able to select my downloaded music from the latest update.,0
"Hope to learn how to go along singing, wonderful. Thank you so much.",1
The ads are less frequent which has allowed me to really think about getting the premium service.,0
"It's really good, but your playlists are stuck on an infinite shuffle and you can't take it offâ“",0
I have a free account but I just got charged $9.99.,0
Works great for the most part. But I've had to uninstall-reinstall 5 or 6 times because it glitches every few weeks.,0
I've got WiFi but it won't connect to it,0
Its easy to use,1
It is not working with my mobile data only with WiFi. I have tried everything I know but to no avail! I am highly disappointed in Spotify; expected more!,0
Perfect for listening to music with lots of features,1
Spotify mobile is filled with an inhuman amount of ads and compared to the pc version it is far worse,0
"Last updates made the app worse when in Android Auto mode. Keeps crashing and hanging, can't olay anything and does not remember last played. Have to close app several times to get it working",0
"Love the App, the only thing I don't care for, is you can't really stop, and go back to another song. It is hard to figure out, but I'm still learning.... This app came in handy, for the CCMF , in Myrtle Beach, SC.. June 9-12, 2022... LOVE LISTENING TO MY FAVORITE ARTISTS SONGS!!!",0
Awesome I love the way you can do almost anything even without the premium in my opinion the #1 music app for me but I dont know if this happens only for me or for anyone else but they add song that I dont want to my playlist that's what I removed a star but I alse like the way you can watch an ad for no ads for 30 mins love it.,1
It's hard to find a song it's not a playlist anymore if you are not premium you cant find the song and so many advertisment.,0
My Experience has been great with Spotify! Group Fitness Instructor ðŸ˜,1
Now Spotify is pushing for premium.We can't play any individual song now.That's I am giving one rating,0
the new update is so bad when i play my favorite song it dosent play the song it plays a random song and i hate it so much please fix this and the no repeating thingy,0
"Lately, every time I start listening to a song in one of my playlists, the stupid app decides that it's time to play my songs randomly. Shuffle play is automatically selected every time in every playlist. It's annoying.",0
Terrific app. All of my music in my library has disappeared and got moved to my Playlist which I can't even sort to play songs by the same artist.,0
I like the music and the recommendations. Some ads are annoying.,0
"Had a nice,good experience. Kindly add download option too without premium",0
"It's ok I just hate when I want to listen to my favorite songs they play suggested songs instead, it gets on my nerves",1
Haven't been using long enough for 5 stars. Am happy so far. Still figuring stuff out.,1
"Constant random crashes, Bluetooth not connecting to my car, not displaying the song that is currently playing on my phone. What's up, Spotify? Can I get a refund or what? Lol",0
Now playing controls disappear on a Samsung S22 Ultra. Only remedy appears to be to restart phone.,0
The advertisement is just too much I just downloaded a new music app just in case you don't reduce the ads,0
top,1
Awesome overall. Thanks Spotify,1
Unable to play podcasts. When played app closes instantly.,0
"I have two reasons to Love Spotify , first they are the best music streaming app and second they sponsor FC Barcelona ðŸ¤©",1
"The play bar in the bottom of the app constantly disappears after changing apps, while the music continues to play. The same goes for the notification controls. Samsung S21 Ultra, Android 12",0
"Best music service app ever, no bugs, no problem, nothing",1
"Spotify is very good app to listen music. Ads are fine even though it is irritating sometimes. But lyrics are not correct for most of the Tamil songs. It's all in Romanized version and spellings and pronounciation are wrong for everything. I suggest you to give lyrics for Tamil songs in Tamil like how you give the original lyrics for other language songs. It will be more appreciated. Thank you. Otherwise, Spotify is very good app.",1
I live this bc u can hear it all the time even with out wifi Lol ðŸ™‚ðŸ¤ŒðŸ½ðŸ•Šï¸ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤ªðŸ¥ºðŸ’–âœŒðŸ½,0
This the best app among all but they give more adds but surely this the best platform for listening songs I just luv it. Voice quality best they know what you loved to listen ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹ and must say that if you have to choose definitely pick Spotify â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,1
"There's some issue with this app on my phone, it isn't getting opened, could you please assist",0
"The shuffle function is broken. I've tried all the tricks - resorting the playlists; turning shuffle off and back on again; etc. - but nothing seems to help. More frustrating than this though is that the cache file is huge, and I regularly have to clear the cache (monthly at least), or my device runs out of storage space. I can't download songs to my SD card because for some reason it makes the app file on my phone significantly bigger, and I again run out of space.",0
Quite a few artists are now pulling their music from Spotify. So the already limited selection has now become less again. Now going to look in to other equivalent services,0
Fix your systems! Cannot play more than 3 sec and stop. Cut my premium 'cos of this,0
"Love using the app, I use it when I'm on the go, cleaning, writing, or getting ready to wind down for sleep. But I've noticed a few songs aren't listed any longer, but when I look them up on Google it shows they should still be there. What gives?",1
It just simply is using a different sing to the one I select,0
Its a good app but the constant ads have left me woth 9 ads in a row. Horrble do better,0
"Wish there were no ads in a music app! Stop telling me its great for the app; it's really annoying! I don't care if it's apart of free service, can't click a song without listening to an ad!",0
Great range of music. Easy to use.,1
I enjoy listening to Spotify it plays the music I pick,1
"Hi there, Spotify App has been great till recent update. Sometimes music plays but I cannot see nor control which song is playing. I can't replay or restart a song. Sometimes the bar shows that the song has been restarted whilst the song playing does not restart. I can't contol my playing song on my Smart Watch or my Car any longer. I have also started experiencing start / stop whilst the song is playing. Please look into these issues.",0
Excellent amazing and fabulous app i have no words to describe this I try many music app but this app playlist is ossam you can play any song resso make me happy every day every minute and every second my morning makes happy you resso because I love music listening I have. Amazing journey with you I hope this continue . Thank you resso and your amazing playlist is too good ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ™ƒðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜,1
Pretty cool if one could figure it out!,1
"I have a Premium Plan I use on a Samsung, but after the latest update I can't listen to anything at all. It tells me I don't have internet when I do. It tells me all the playlists are empty. If I look up a song, it won't play it. I have deleted the app, restarted my phone and reinstalled. I have cleared the cache and data and then done all of those steps. I have done the ""clean reinstall"" steps. The only time I can get the app to function is if my SD card is not in my phone. Not a solution.",0
Its really good because when you want toplay a game while listening it lets you i love the app no adds this app deserves 5 stars i mean jts a great app! Thank you makers of Spotify its a awesome idea a d app good job making this app its so good i ca t spell,1
Paying for an app that's ridiculously slow... Constant issues,0
It not the best it keeps on giving me a short listen to the songs i liked,0
Too much ads....,0
"Good music and lots of it for a good price, the story of how they got started is interesting too.",1
"Half the time its ADs. 30 minutes Ad free after an AD, then in a few minutes it plays another AD, switch song? Its an AD, scroll down for info? an AD. Every corner of this app runs an AD. I give up on this greedy app and its lacking premium mode, I rather buy the songs at that rate.",0
Its good bc,1
Normally i pretty much like it. But the main problem I can't listen my main wanted song that I want to listen. Should be make this to anyone can use this.,0
Been paying for premium for months and months use Spotify daily but recently the apps been working poorly the play bar is hidden half the time forcing me to restart the app several times just to fix it and without the bar I cant pause skip or see what's playing FIX IT it's doing it on all my devices so I know it's not just this phone doing it,0
Fjiiok,1
Paying for premium and I'm still getting ads,0
"I used to love this app and am a premium subscriber, but Spotify has become almost unusable. It crashes, loses functionality, and randomly skips on a daily basis. I either have to restart my phone or stop the app to get it working as designed and promised. I have reinstalled a few times and that doesn't help. What a sad death for what had been a valuable service.",0
Its an alright app nothing better than that,1
"Incredibly buggy recently, often it won't show what's playing in notifications or in the app and you have to close and reopen the application to work",0
"I absolutely love this station,since get the enjoyment of the kind of music I like. I love gospel and oldies are my go to but there are other types I like and the choices are endless.",0
Totally UNPLEASING ... the ADS !!! They irritate so much.. not 1 not 2 .. 3 adds straight in row at initial song play ... This used to be a fabulous app.. but doesn't seem now it would delight any more with numerous adds prompting on frequently.,0
The app automatically closes when i play something. I reinstalled the app multiple times and it still closes. Help Spotify. Thank you,1
Outstanding service to me! My playlist will blow your mind OMG! ðŸ’œðŸ’œâ¤ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ’£ðŸ’£ðŸ’£ðŸ’£,1
Keeps pausing and logging out. What's going on??,0
Love the app. Will appreciate it if you could incorporate voice active option to skip the the next song when using wireless earphones,1
I love Spotify would give 5 starts bit I can't get past the loading screen and I pay for this app,0
Play button/bar/lockscreen gadget disappears while music is playing. Songs stop suddenly and after 2 seconds continues. I'm a premium member. This is occurring since last update.,0
Have used this app for years and loved it all of a sudden I can't access pause or stop or any controls on music or podcasts. . I use Samsung and its really annoying as it now keeps shutting down. I reinstalled and still no joy. ðŸ˜”,0
The latest releases are always so buggy please fix asap or give me an option to choose a stable version I want to be on this is not beta anymore.,0
"Premium is cool but PODCASTS on here is trash, how come I pay for premium but my #podcasts on Spotify are showing the ads? I DID NOT ASK FOR ADS ON MY PODCASTS WHEN I PAID TO GET RID OF THEM IN GENERAL. ALSO JENNIFER SAUNDERS COVER OF ""I NEED A HERO"" PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PUT IT ON SPOTIFY ALREADY!!!!",0
Too much ads. Almost after every song ads come but it tells that after one ads you can hear music for 30 minutes... But it's fake almost after every song ads is shown and after two songs it's guaranteed that one ads will come... Befor installing the app you should think if you don't have troubled regarding too much ads you should download the songs from websites and listened them on offline. It will be much better to listened songs in offline mode... Spotify team you should solve this problem.,0
i cannot live without Spotify.,1
"Why does my review keep being deleted? Can't control my music, widget keeps disappearing while it keeps playing. Often stops randomly.",0
The best app for music & podcasts. I love it & use it several times every day.,1
I like this app i only leaning kpop songs i love this app,1
It's a really good app for overall I have to get a four stars because I didn't use it for about a month and it reset my account which is not something I'm a fan of because it erased all of my search history and I can never remember my search history it's just ridiculous that it reset my entire account I had to go in and then you create another password just because I didn't use it for a month it was just so ridiculous and it was like a lengthy process too I got really sick and tired of it. :))),0
I'm not able to add some song in playlist ðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž,0
We still cannot see the number of songs in a playlist??? What's the matter with you guys. Very VERY lame...,0
"Recently so buggy to the degree I'm considering other music services. Now playing disappearing from app and drop down, random pauses, other issues. I have been a paid user for a very long time.",0
"Long time user and moving to another service. Playlists have become so repetitive they're useless. Like 80% of my Spotify-created playlists starts with the exact same song, every single day. And they're made up of about 80% the same songs. Offline downloads don't work half the time, so when I'm on a hike and want to listen to music I have to have a backup app with songs downloaded.",0
Loving every moment listing to my favourite music ðŸŽµ,1
Love listening to great songs,1
This app has been crashing for the last 2 days whenever I'm trying to play a song. Pls fix it ASAP.,0
"Ever since the recent updates, the app has acting up, the previous songs name and album art remains in the notifcation bar while the next song plays. Most of the times i cant even pause or change the song from the lock screen as I cant see anything. Weird please fix. I am a paying customer and do not appreciate using such a pathethic app.",0
Ads and commercials scared me off this one.,0
"For me it is perfect music app,respectðŸ§â€â™‚ï¸",1
The only reason I subscribe to this app is for joe rogan and other podcast if y'all start editing in any way not only will I delete but I will make it my mission in life to get everyone I meet to do the same,1
"I really like the audio quality, the music sounds so crisp and clear. The ""liked songs Playlist"" allows you line up all your favorite hits, like a personal Juke Box.",1
Very nice sounds,1
Problems with WiFi in android tablet- requires constant restart of the app,0
"It's a great music app but, about the updates! UGH! I'm literally updating daily...just check the probs!",0
All thing is well and good but you should accept rupay cards for premium membership...Indian banks don't provide visa or MasterCard until unless you take cards which can be used in other countries...so pls provide rupay cards option too,1
"Become a member and listen to your tunes uninterrupted , I'm not a robot. Just use the app daily it's great in my opinion.",1
"Love listening to Spotify! Whatever mood I'm in, Spotify has the perfect channel:)",1
Spotify app is good app for interest in music tamil people. I like it.It play good songs before 40 years ago. This songs maintain relax the mind and understanding the lyrics.,1
I LOVE this app the only thing I dislike is I have to spend money to be able to listen anywhere,1
"Least it let's me download the songs Pandora won't even though they have it. Though it doesn't have every song i wanted, can't be helped I guess",0
It's really good all the rumors are correct 10-10 better the Pandora,1
I HATE IT SO MUCH i just want to listen to songs because im so stressed out but this dumb spotify keep on adding suggested songs to my playlist AND YOU CANT EVEN REMOVE IT dudeeeee i just want to listen to music that I LIKE just because im not subscribed DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN DO THINGS WITHOUT MY PERMISSION this is a dumb app i hate it all they care about is money,0
"Worst music app, there are a number of ads as compared to songs. It's hard for me to understand whether I am listening to songs or Advertisement ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Ratio of Songs: Advertisement 40%:60% Wanted to give 0 star but there isn't not a option I think",0
"I love Spotify! I use it all the time. I don't get the Premium because I don't ACTUALLY need it. It is a GREAT music app. I can link it up to other accounts and I can use It while using other accounts. Spotify is just all around simply amazing. It's my favorite ""just music"" app. Other than Spotify, I use YouTube. Both are Superb and Excellent sources of music. Top Notch. Top Dollar. Number One. I'm glad I had the opportunity to write this great review. Have an amazing day and Take Care!",1
I love every genre of music that Spotify offers,1
best and simple. love it.,1
"Buggy after update, doesn't show that music is playing and stops at random. Not impressed",0
"A great podcast platform! Also, love the dark background.",1
"Ads are too much. I know that it's for something but 1 minute unskipable ads? No thank you, mate. There's a maximum of 6 skips every hour and we need premium for almost anything useful. Would use YouTube instead if it weren't for the fact that we can play songs with the screen off.",0
Very enjoyable listing,1
Amazing quality music and podcasts Everything from live performances to studio recordings of all your favorite artists at the tips of your fingers,1
Very bad! Last Update is weird! You can't skip music. And songs will are closing in game and etc. Songs will randomly changes. This app is sp buggy Please don't use this app or undo: Cannot skip music! *Please fix this!!*,0
"I don't understand why I'm paying for a premium plan for an app that I constantly have to delete and re-install at least 3 times a week. The app will let me press the play button, but it doesn't let press pause or skip or anything else. Fix this!",0
Impossible to use or navigate. Seems like something that should be simple but its unnecessarily complex.,0
Newest updates have fixed the app for now... Old review : Update broke app. They need to take the money we pay them and actually hire quality assurance teams to test this app.,0
I love my Fav songs. I feel so Lovable...thanks spotify,1
"This ad popped up and my phone was locked. No permission was given. commercials and ads are getting worse, and here is one of them",0
"Terrible update! For some reason the pause/stop button is gone, music keeps stopping every few minutes, really irritating. Why the hell would you break something what worked well before?! Wish I haven't had automatic updates on!",0
Not sure what is going on but automatic opening is aggravating...THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP... ANNOYEDâ€¼ï¸,0
"ALL music is hidden behind a paywall, unless you want to listen to random songs of a certain kind of music, without an option for repeats, plus ads. I'd spend money if the app is good, but so far it isn't.",0
Great music app it gives you all the best tracks!!ðŸ˜ðŸ‘ŒðŸ½,1
Do not like the speaker noise and I can not get my music to download fast even with unlimited data nor can I get my downloaded to play without having my data on.,0
"It's not as laggy anymore and it seems like there are less ads but they improved on the app a lot, and premium is worth buying as well. My rating used to be 4 stars, but now it's 5 stars.",1
"The app works fine for the most part, but if I leave it open for too long then that's when it breaks. The controls will stop working and the screen is stuck on a song thats not playing. Sometimes it'll play while not allowing me to pause. So about twice a day I'll have to force quit the app to get it to work properly again and it's been like that since day one. Since I've tried reinstalling but it never seems to fix it for too long on my Galaxy Note 10+. Spotify really doesn't optimize well.",0
I'm going to keep this one-star review here until you stop hosting intentionally annoying ads. Also the app is a crazy battery drain for a music app I mean really...,0
Spotify is a very good when it comes to stremming music but it should put some songs available offline,1
Fantastic! Lyrics perfect! Recommended!!!,1
Without internet I listened the songs and enjoy my daily traveling,1
Size is ridiculous... 1.9 GB with no music saved and cache deleted - what on earth are you doing?,0
premium user. desktop app had crashed but was still tolerable with the get-arounds. now the mobile app becomes so buggy that it's almost non functional. song doesn't show at the bottom for no reason. no control availble. once the screen is darkened it no longer plays. have to restart the app over and over for this. am seriously considering switching to another app because why do I want to pay for such an annoying experience.,0
So hard to just play one song adds song to your playlists very annoying,0
So ridiculously hard to get to the player controls and now playing. Love access to the music but this app is awful ðŸ‘Ž,0
"Good day everyone I would strongly recommend that you use Google music premium as spotify premium is useless,they have robbed me 2 months of premium trial?it doesn't even work I choose premium family but still my family can't connect, yet with Google music premium it works immediately no issues no trial premium BS! I want my money back Spotify !",0
Can't go back to a previous song. Can't listen to a specific song. Can't listen to a playlist in order. Keeps adding songs to my playlists without permission. I try to listen to songs from a specific artist and it adds songs from other artists. App is missing basic functions. Spotify is trash ðŸ—‘,0
"I support the decisions of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young to remove their music from Spotify. I'm uninstalling the app because of Spotify's annual $300 million payments to Joe Rogan, who spouts dangerous lies about race, the Coronavirus, and other topics of importance, simply to shock. Spotify pays him simply because they make money off him not because of the value of anything he says. I am taking my music listening elsewhere. This is an easy way to stand up for truth-- please join me!",0
"Great ap, massive song choice, easy to create playlists",1
"Easy to search for your favorite music and wide range of music genres. Loved music, loved Spotify.",1
Fine,1
I love the app the only problem is I only get 6 skips per hour because I am not on the premium account ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”,0
Spotify is worth the money. I couldn't cope without it!,1
Best app for songs. Got every song I wanted and making a playlist is very easy.,1
Its good until it stops giving you the 30 minutes ad free,1
Alot of glitches and music just stopping. Please fix these issues.,0
It's very cool ðŸ˜ƒ but sometimes I forget.my playlist's name and idkhow to know it back so hea good app,1
Good it is just so limited without subscription,0
"Toooooooo much ads , please decrease the ads otherwise I will move on other app",0
I really moved by Gods presence in worship,1
"The group session used to work fine and was easy to join, and has now become impossible.",0
Acting weird lately. Issues with the pause button not working. When I first start it up in the morning it will play a few seconds of a song then skip to a different song.,0
It can give a detailed seies of songs bt cant download the songs to listen offline like tube player.,0
Spotify>apple music Premium is hella worth it,1
Love the podcast selection,1
just wish it would let u download and keep music after the subscrition is done,0
I give a 3 star writing simply because I do not want to start over this app used to be great I used to love it but as of lately it has been very glitchy and adds songs and playlists on its own. I pay for premium and it does not give me the premium service in which i pay. Until i find a better app ill stick it out for now,0
Super,1
I never listened to music much but I listen to it through Spotify several hours a day.,1
So much music! Global reach...make magic for us...we all need it ... everyday!,1
Latest update causes frequent crashes.,0
"This is great you can have any music and over 1000 of podcast, I love it the sound quality it very good too. I would recommend to others and I am saying that it is the best music app,",1
Excellent,1
"Its a great app for music but it will randomly change and I won't be able to listen to songs on they're own without it playing a random playlist with that song, nor can I put a song on repeat and it's frustrating! Please fix this",0
I loved Spotify enough to let go of Saavn and Gaana Now I am back to Wynk Gaana and will explore Saavn too There are two ads after every two songs Let us not even discuss the features wherein we cant scroll back or ahead not able to shuffle the way I want and I dont know what all Spotify is trying to be the pesky little neighbourhood child that you wont give your candy to,1
It is cool app. We can enjoy our favorite musics while even using other apps. But we can't see which song to be play next .that's only problem i see in this app Totally this app is cool We can make playlists And we don't need premium â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸,1
This app is amazing for music and its feature the podcasts . OP app ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©,1
"Holy Skynet Batman! I was listening to Spotify yesterday and turned it off after an hour or so. Then today I was listening to a rough recording I just made of a piano arrangement I'm working on, turned that off, and Spotify kicked back in right where I turned it off yesterday. The app was not even in use, it just decided to do that even though it was supposedly off. I couldn't find a way to turn it off, so I rebooted the phone and it came right back. Whose damn device is this anyway?",0
Great so far easy to use .like the new music that it suggests not everyone likes this feature. But love being able to listen to music,1
"Best app in world!!! No issues with ads (comes only sometimes), network problem (never ever if you are having broadband) and song volume or quality... I love this appðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜",1
Is have a real full song is awesome ðŸ¥ºâ¤ï¸âœŒï¸,1
My Spotify is not opening I am trying from so long but no response please fix this problem as soon as possible whenever I open it the logo of Spotify appears and it doesn't go for for so long I keep waiting that when will it open and when will I be able to enjoy the songs please fix this problem I want to use Spotify I haven't use it from so long,0
Yes...i downloaded this app....now i can continously listen and enjoy ads....only problem is songs are interupting in between songs ..so i request the developers to remove songs ....so i can listen to ads without disturbance ...,0
"Recently I have been getting 5 to 6 ads every half hour and if this isn't fixed soon I am going to uninstall the app! I use this app so that I can simply use other apps while listening, I don't want to pay for premium when I don't need it!",0
"Spotify is overall one of, if not the best music/podcast streaming services out there. Very user-friendly, it exists on most devices, and it contains *most* of your favourite artists/songs. The ads are fine, a lot better than Youtube's ad-wall. Spotify is just so perfect, I really recommend it~!",1
"Ok. I often have to delete than reinstall because I lose the ability to stop or change songs. Frankly, I would have stayed with apple had it been compatible at home.",0
Spotify has a great variety of content and gives the listener the ability to curate their experience to their own personal tastes. The app works great.,1
I absolutely Hate the 6song skip rule. And the adds are not helping!,0
"The app overall is a good app but for those who don't get the premium subscription, at first there a re very little ads but as time goes by the number of ads start to increase. Something like 5 ads before a 2 min music. But the ux(user experience) is very good",1
"The app is good and all but the real problem is the insane amount of ads. Whenever I start to play a song, 2-4 ads show up. Spotify, please fix this.",0
It's literally more ads than music at this point and it's pisisng me tf off,0
Compares very badly when compared to Pandora app. Spotify still doesn't have a decent algorithm to suggest new songs which we might like based on our ratings. Music selection and podcast selection are very good but too many ads ruin the experience.,0
"Issues continue for app on my Samsung s10. Multiple updates over the last few weeks, same problem. The streaming locked screen notification just disappears, then the app keeps playing while unlocked until screen locks every few minutes then pauses having to unlock everytime to keep streaming. Then cannot shut off or pause the app without resetting the phone. App doesn't even show that it is still streaming. Never an issue until a few weeks ago.",0
Vega music app,1
Grate and lots of diffrent songs,0
"The app is exceptional at first but now It is acting up a lot. It doesn't play the music I select and it doesn't allow me to listen while not on the app like before. I am not liking it very much. It is bad. You can't even import your old songs into the in order to listen to them because it jams or doesn't stream the music at all. And also when you select a song to play, it only plays it like for 10 seconds or so and only a short piece of it. It also skips some parts and plays unknown songs too .",0
Can't play downloaded songs when you don't have internet.,0
"back button doesnt work sometimes (like it goes back to 0:00 but the audio itself wouldnt go back and would just continue playing). it also gets messed up when you queue (i.e sometimes the last song you queued is the first and the only one that would appear in the queue list, and you cant edit the queue because you cant see the other songs that are queued). not sure if its a problem with my phone, but please look into it!! the app is perfect otherwise :))",0
"If you don't pay for premium it likes to spit ads at you a lot, I get up to like 8 ads at least 30 second to 1 and a half minutes long a piece. I don't recommend unless ready to pay, otherwise you'll fight to hear your music. VERY VERY frustrating",0
Good flow of enriching songs,1
update,1
"Now that I have a car I can use Bluetooth with, I listen to Spotify all the time! It's free, come on!! Any song. Any artist. Wow!! It creates your Playlist and liked songs, etc,., in groups for you! Very cool ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ‘Œ",1
Great way to find new music and artists!,1
1) Joe Rogan is trash 2) I hate that now when I'm listening to my music on shuffle it starts the playlist over everytime I open Spotify instead of picking up where it left off. I end up listening to the same songs over and over instead of listening through the playlist.,0
"The premium blocks ads, but also I've been having problems with Spotify chashing constantly. As soon as I turn off my phone, the music cuts.",0
The inly thing holding it back is the ads,0
The app keeps stopping to display the song I'm currently playing. I have tried all the fixes but nothing works. Considering moving to another service.....,0
It became even worse. This company does not care about their customers. And now it spreds dangerous information about inefficiency of the vaccine. People can die because of Spotify.,0
So many adds,1
"Playback bar (aka where you control the playing, pausing and fast forwarding etc) keeps disappearing on Android phone. This makes the app essentially useless. Seems to be the latest update. Even on my Premium account. Android users get screwed once again!",0
This app is amazing it has all the artists and songs I want,1
App is amazing but why did y'all remove the lyrics feature?,0
Update: App finally works. This was a great app when it worked. Now it never loads.,0
Beyond incredible selection of books and music,1
"Why is it that we pay for premium but still get ads for every page on the app? Who gives any about podcasts?? Seriously, we aren't paying for a new set of advertisements. Maybe try listening to your consumers? It has also been glitching lately as well... it is the only app that will not connect to the internet.",0
So adding on more commercials will not make me go premium. U are getting me to switch music apps!,0
Best application for Anime songs!,1
"My last review was 2 stars, because of the amount of Ads I get when I listen to podcasts, even though I should have no ads... Now I'm compromising. Keep JRE and I won't change platforms... Nobody needs Neil Young around any-how.",0
"Get premium, if you love music and podcasts. This is THE last app you'll need for almost all your music listening purposes.",0
It's such a great for music listeners and music lover spotify is the best app for music,1
"unusable, songs will not even play and the app crashes constantly",0
"Hardly works. Click on liked songs, doesn't load. Have to close the app and try again and repeat until it works. Still my preferred music app but it's a struggle. Try to click play nothing happens, lots of bugs.",0
I love listening to music and I also love playing mobile games. Spotify lets me do both AT THE SAME TIME!!!,1
"I use it for music all the time, but as of recently I can't download anything. I still have premium, so I don't know what's wrong.",0
It makes me listen to great music and I just wanna listen to it even more because it gives me peace and massive music,1
"I love Spotify, especially when I have premium",1
Its a good idea for people to lisen to music with no adds.,1
"Lately when listening to music, it stops then starts. Thought it was my phone but after reading reviews, seems like alot of people have the same problem. Fix it Spotify or you will lose alot of money.",0
It is best music app you will find I personally have been using it since 3 yearswithout premium also you enjoy many things,1
This app has become so buggy over the years. Like really buggy. Slow down on the changes and make sure the updates actually work.,0
"The amount of ads is disgusting, i had to go through 6 ads, listened to 2 songs, and got ads again. On top of that, you cant even choose the music you want to specifically listen to",0
Spotify is a great app with beautiful recommendations,1
First of all. Im not a premium user but i love Spotify and one thing is getting worst..Ads!!..too many ads.. compared to any other music streaming apps.. Spotify have too many ads.. please do something,0
Poeple are missing a great app,0
Great music streaming app,1
I have been using spotify for 7+ years I listen to it every day thanks you spotify for all yall do,1
"What do they keep doing to the app? Music controls just randomly disappear every few songs and won't let me skip or pause music, even when app is fully closed music randomly plays on my phone. When it connects to Bluetooth it'll just delete my entire queue of songs and I'll have to go back through it and find them all again. Keeps stopping the song every 20 seconds too. It was working perfectly before, don't know what you guys did to it.",0
"It is the best app that I have on my phone!! I can listen to my fav music and also make my own playlist so my friends can listen. Though, it has some problems. I dont like how I choose a song and it plays another song that is totally different from the song I chose. I also dont like it when I cant repeat the song I just listened. There is also a bug ive been experiencing lately. It always shows the spotify logo on the screen when I use my phone. Its a great app though:)",1
love the app !! but theres an issue. when i go to add my songs to my playlist. its says 'add songs' i press on it but theres no play button near the songs i wanna add... what if i like that song... youve just removed a feature that i like about this stupid app ðŸ’€,0
Please make a shortcut during the songs to add it quickly to your playlists instead of searching for them and add it manually,0
I love this app.....can't wait to go premium,1
This app is very good for music lovers!This is very good recommendation!,1
That's absolutely good app I could listen the songs when ever I want that fantastic app ... and I can listen any songs in this app even my favorite ones also there daily mix which there are Givin are absolutely ðŸ’¯ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ‘Œ super and perfect,1
"Kept adding songs to my playlist and making me listen to songs that I didn't want to listen to, terrible app.",1
This is so good to download it cause you can play whatever you want a song and you can post it i love it,1
"Long time user. Used to love it. It's so glitchy now it's borderline unusable. Between the crashing and glitches, I can't even get through 45 mins of listening without it losing track of what song it's on. Or cutting in and out of songs when my phone locks. Would consider moving on to a different app run by people that aren't so complacent",0
Love it but it have a lot of abs,1
"The best app for listening to music and podcasts. I'm really amazed by their enthusiasm of creating integration of their platform with others in so many innovative ways, from their support in the car displays to the discord application. I would love to join this highly creative company in some or the other ways, because I love creativity, exploring and coding :)",1
"The app just sucks. Despite my music being downloaded, when my signal is a bit buggy, the app won't show me my music unless I manually go into offline mode. Also, it recently has started to play music, but not recognise that it is playing (I.e., no play bar at bottom or in the menu bar on my phone). For a service I pay a lot for every month, it is incredibly infuriating.",0
Not being able to pick any song without premium is my only complaint.,0
I can enjoy listening to music anytime where ever I go easy to find anytype of music you would like to listen to enjoy,1
Spotify is a really amazing app It has every single song you want I love this app,1
Always a pleasure to listen to spotify .,1
"Best music app I ever used and I had about used everyone of those apps dam near!!! Plus it's a reasonable price, considering all the functions and options it has especially if you are a Premium subscriber.",1
Great music selection,1
You can download any podcasts or songs and listen to it bith online and offline and it's really good ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜ðŸ¥°ðŸ’—ðŸ’–ðŸ˜Š,1
My personal rating and use experience. I enjoyed listening to music from Spotify. I give it 5 Stars because an app that does this good for you deserves nothing less. Keep up the good work to the workers behind the scenes. It's good work and it is noticeable to us!!! ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ â¹,1
I love this app very much. Best music app ever in life.,1
Stops playing in middle controls are getting disappeared.... it is like take premium and get bugs,0
Its good am movieng alongside hopefully to enjoy,1
It is good but too many ads I suggest you reduce the amount of ads,0
I've not had any problems . Couldn't ask for a better music app.,1
Huge database. Easy to use interface. Value for money.,0
"Today I was driving and streaming some podcasts, and somehow Spotify managed to EAT UP 10 GBs OF DATA in less than 3 hours!! 10!!! Completely unacceptable ðŸ˜¡ Now I have very limited data left for 2 weeks until my next billing period.",0
Still have issues accessing my downloaded Playlist when I have no reception.,0
Spotify is the best music app in the world but if they keep going up in price they are going to lose members. Keep the price low please!,0
Spotify play my kind of Music and I love it so much More ,1
It is a really amazing app i love it so muchðŸ˜Š. It has many options so that we find pirtcular song easilyðŸŽµ. Please add lyrics for other songs also & provide a download option wich will be useful to us when we are offline. This app lags sometimes please fix it ðŸ™‚.,1
"I use this way too much but sometimes there are certian songs I cant find or when I set the sleep timer the options are very limited and the longest one is only and hour long. It would be very cool if they added ""end of playlist"" to the sleep timet",0
"Love the app, but if yall get rid of jr (atleast for the reasons that are rn) im gone, its the main reason i downloaded it. Stay neutral",0
Okay I only liked this for a day but then random songs that dont sound good at all are now in my playlist last I searched which was a day before writing this you had to have a minimum of 15 songs I got well over 20 that fixed it temporarily but then I tried to listen to a playlist but a random song I never heard before comes I cant block it cannot skip ahead of it what's the point of this app if you can't even listen to the music you want to do I recommend this app for now I CERTAINLY DO NOT!!!!,0
"I love having instant access to music all day, everyday, no matter what my mood is!",1
Yes its too good app Ive been using it since one year and its too good but please improve your premium add problem,1
new update won't let me see songs playing or pause or anything. Was nice before. Now not so much. kinda ðŸ¥”ish,0
Love it! Has all the music & podcasts I need,1
have been using spotify on and off different phones for a long time and CAN say it's my fave music and podcast app,0
"Good app, good content, swipe added!",1
I love music ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ so it's wonderful extraordinary app!,1
solid experience while using this app much appreciated!,1
"Ad breaks replay when you rewind. Find it annoying when an ad interrupts the thought or sentence? Want to rewind and replay the last sentence without an ad break? Nope! The ad will play again when you play over the same point. Maybe it's intentional, but if so, why would I put up with it? Maybe it's a glitch and you'll fix it? I guess you don't test your builds before releasing them. Once again, why would I put up with it? I'm just gonna uninstall and download the raw audio.",0
Too many ads spotify is the best app to listen free ads,1
everything is good but my question is i have so many downloaded songs then when i open the data it's downloading again i mean it's downloaded right? so why it's downloading again? sorry I'm bad in English but i hope you understand guysðŸ’—,0
"I am using premium, but I can't find the canvas option in my account. Is it just in my case or the option has not come in Bangladesh yet? please fix this ðŸ™‚",0
I give one star only because mugamoodi movie songs and dheena movie songs are not added.,0
This app ia good its always updated in new songs and dif. Genre. I looking forward that i can play it offline even im not premium use,1
"Fails to start automatically properly sometimes: ""Spotify is trying to play"" notification. Even with this notification it plays, but there no standard controls displayed in the app to stop the playback - have to forcekill the app to stop the music. First noticed approximately 2-4weeks ago. Latest stable android 12 @ pixel 5",0
It's a good app to listen to your favorite songs some people complain about the 6 skips an hour but its great it gives you a chance to find new music / new things you might be interested it or likeðŸ‘. Overall great app,1
Please stop with the full screen Duo ads for premium. I'm not your target audience. Don't make me switch to YouTube Music :(,0
Best music app. with terrible adds.,0
Use it on all long drives because there are really interesting things to listen to,1
"I really enjoy this app and kindly i be searching songs, that i have never listened for a long long timeâ¤ thanks to this app niether it depletes to much data cost, but thanksðŸ˜ðŸ¤™ðŸ»",1
Latest update has many flaws. Repeatedly asks to enable Bluetooth even after clearing all caches and rebooting. Controls for volume unexpectedly disappear at times. Spotify has a quality control problem.,0
I can't play one music when I search the music that I want...ðŸ¤”,0
"I'm not sure why my local files has ALL OF MY PRIVATE voice recordings on my Spotify account. And I'm not able to access them, nor am I able to delete them off your app. As a premium member for years I'm deeply disappointed in how bad Spotify has gotten.",0
I rated it 3 strs because I can't listen any music I wanted and it only available for premium especially I can't listen to it offline and listening offline is for premium too. Almost everything is for premium I hope one day it changes and let us listen to it for free and can do anything like premium too! Btw it's kinda good too ^^,1
"I like how it gives you options on gapless playback, the recommendations are usually great but sometimes mediocre. Overall a great app.",0
Not able to listen already downloaded music while using the app on the phone. When listening on the tablet no problem. Same account,0
"Great app, using for podcasts mostly for now, nice and easy to navigate.",1
Audio quality is top class. But sometimes it literally feels like I'm listening to ads in between songs!,0
"Great app, everything works easy and well.",1
You should be able to have the option to see the lyrics of the songs.,1
"THIS APP IS AMAZING. Name a song and u can get it for free and put it on ur playlist. U can listen to it in the car, in ur bedroom, and anywhere.",1
Very expensive premium for Tajikistan((,1
Way better than Apple music or Amazon music,1
I had a great experience listening to music I love..,1
Playback Screen Freezing. It shows you a different song other than the one you're actually playing,0
Please bring back car mode. I had to break out my ipod and download all my music so I don't have to open Google maps while driving (using data) to have it show what song is playing,0
I love it makes my job go by fast....,1
"Bad app, theres better options available, hard to navigate menus you have to pay money if you want to skip songs in playlists theres no option to just listen to a song you have to listen to through a entire playlist its just bad not worth the download.",0
Nice application very nice poltform,1
"During ads will completely glitch out and restart podcast. On Android Motorola phone has no status bar when playing. Basically have to open the actual app to pause or make any active skip, repeat, etc... And this is the paid version, until now...",0
Latest update has killed my Spotify through Android auto. I cannot play music in the car at all,0
So unlike other people i cant turn off shuffle play ...i dont have the arrow buttons and im stuck on shuffle play but otherwise this is the best music app u wont regret downloading it,1
"I hate this app. Really I do!!! When you search a song and want to play it, it plays something different. It's irritating as hell!!",0
my internet is perfect and the app is not working.......it's like no internet you offline what gives and yes I should be taking two stars,0
premium is the way to go but still needs more features,0
Please enable all the feature to every country and region instead of region category based besides lyrics Isn't showed plus there's no canvas options In our BD region Spotify It's sucks! Please fox it asap.,0
I wish the phone app wasn't increase its storage space by itself. I'm not doing anything but app incrase its storage space up to 12 GB.,0
Bring back the like button,1
"I can't even load the app anymore. I have a gig of free storage, so that's not it. I have had this problem for the past 3 weeks on or off wi-fi.",0
Easy and enjoyable,1
"App keeps crashing on X70 pro plus just by ""PLAYING ANY SONG "", really irritating.",0
"Usually love this app and works fine on my phone but on my laptop its a mess. It closes down within seconds of opening it, and doesn't want to work. Sadly its only the spotify desktop app which is giving me problems, i hope they check if there are some bugs soon :) other than that love the app",0
"Read the permissions closely. It a great app, but what you allow or what you agree to share is not worth it. Financial? Share all personal information? Allowing to have all your history? Way way to much personal info to give/share with the unknown people behind the other end.",0
"I should look into getting something better to listen to music on, but Spotify is easy. It is also riddled with ads seemingly designed to infuriate me and pays artists pennies. If I could give it zero stars I would",0
I pay for Spotify premium and now whenever I play music The app stops playing music and says there's no internet connection available,0
"Just installed this on my android 12 phone. Won't open, just stucks in the logo like forever. Tried restarting, reinstalling, clear cache. Nothings help",0
"Used to love the app but now I cant acess my 'liked songs' it just says something's wrong try again, over and over and over and my whole library semms to have just vanished!!",0
"Autoplay won't turn off so I have to listen to unrelated, random music instead of the next episode of a podcast. Please fix this issue.",0
Has a radio presenter for 7 years now I have been using Spotify for my music great app. I was wondering if Spotify is working on a Spotify broadcasting app for people like myself and others. I can see it been greatly appreciated by many with its simplicity and easy to manage features. I would be the first to sign up. Headley kissmineckradio.co.uk .,1
Good App,1
Good app. I like how they accept free speech. But terribly annoyed that it glitches and I often can't see my currently playing track so I can't skip to the next song or go back or forward in my podcast. Playback randomly stops every ten minutes. Love it.,0
Best app to listen music of your choice.,1
bad app JK ITS A GOOD APP ILY SPOTIFY ITS A GREAT APP I LOVE IT SM ,1
If u don't have Spotify premium you are missing out buddy on something good.,0
Great selection of music and they know what I like!!!,1
It is an amazing app you should try it no ads,1
This app sucks. How many times I logged in it is going directly to premium page. I think my free trial completed and I changed my mail id but it didn't changed. And again going to premium page. It is our choice. If we want to take premium we will purchase. You(Spotify team) don't have force us. Please understand. And fix this problem. Thank you.,0
Excellent app took a while to understand how to use no problems now,0
Very Good App,1
"Equalizer sometimes turns off when I scroll right to the next song, or when I pause the song. To turn it back on I need to pause the song and unpause it every time it happens. Please fix this bug.",0
"Fantastic, love it, something for everyone ðŸ‘ŒðŸ’ž",1
In general the product is good but the app quality is poor. I don't know if I'm in their dev releases but I keep experiencing issues. Right now on all our phones we can't see the song which is playing or being able to pause - you have to exit. If I click a song I need to close a dialog box saying no internet but the song still plays. I know you guys work agile but do you at least see if the main features work?,0
helps when I play my games on ps4 or any game station,1
"Has never let me down, has all my music I have ever searched for",1
Too much ad cant tolerable,0
"It's difficult to listen to a playlist to go to sleep, it continues after the playlist playing popular recommended songs",0
I want to be able to scroll down my playlist but I can't anymore,0
I've been using Spotify for years and it's only gotten better! Best music app!,0
Where is your customer service? App crashes unexpectedly all the time. Sound goes awry and starts cracking. It crashes my phone and the music is gone. I have to reset the app all the time.,0
"Easy to use, great selection, keeps me fuelled through the day",1
"I love spotify and use is all the time,but the only thing that I don't like about spotify is that it doesn't play all of the songs on the playlist before it repeats some of the songs. But other than that I would definitely recommend it.",1
"Latest update and my ""now playing"" is missing and I am unable to skip songs or see what is playing.",0
Having problems here lately of the sings playing with out it stopping in a middle of playing. It has issues of playing in the background. I go to the settings and not where there to set it to play in the background.,0
Yeah it's a nice app if you buy the subs but without it the ads are annoying like they do emotional damage...nah...jk... it's a good app without subs too...but please i would like to say that use material ui type things it enhanceses user experience...,1
Amazing a lot better than Pandora love the podcasts. Love it,1
It's a good app. So easy to use. I like itâ—‰â€¿â—‰â—‰â€¿â—‰ðŸ‘ðŸ»,1
The now playing screen won't come up. Sometimes podcast queues just delete themselves. My downloaded music randomly gets undownloadwd,0
"The music offline isnt working, i cant play anything even if its downloaded, that and the app has changed so much and for worse",0
"Wouldnt think of switching. For ANY price. SPOTIFY is the one and only. They are the best option, when it comes to great music, that sounds great.",1
"It's Spotify What do you want me to say. You want music, podcasts or whatever. It's there",0
A day will come when spotify will make listening to music premium ,1
Music ðŸŽ¶ I thought that I would never heard again and music I have never heard some of the best music I listen to it all the time.,1
Worst app I've ever used. Hands down. I made a Playlist. This app will not. I repeat. Will not play a song on that Playlist. I can't rewind a song. I can't skip song's I don't want to hear without paying $10 a month. Who would pay $10 a month for an app that functions this poorly? Or maybe it only works when you pay the subscription. Either way. Terrible.,0
I have no clue when there are new releases from artist I like. I have to search for their new music instead of it being on the opening page.,0
Whatever recent update happened is really buggy. I can get through maybe 2-3 songs on an album and then midsong it will just stop entirely and forget where I was. This happens when leaving phone screen off and not accidentally pressing headphone controls or tapping the screen at all.,0
App constantly pauses/closes and the navigation bar dissapears on two different phones I have. It's extremely frustrating,0
ðŸ–•I want free speach...not censorship by big tech A-holes. Keep your app and has-been pop stars.,1
Update is buggier then the older version . Music randomly starts playing and it actually randomly stops playing when I'm actually actively listening to it . Very inconvenient.,0
I pay for subscription and half the time the app won't load in.,0
it sometimes crashes even though the app is compatible with my android! please fix! I'm enjoying my days here and I'm thankful enough,1
"this app just makes horrible updates for example. say you want to find a nice song for your playlist so you go click onto the song to hear it for a couple seconds they took the feature away, so now you won't know what songs u like",0
What would cruising and work be without my Spotify?! Premium is where it's at,0
"Barely possible to use after recent update. Constant crashing, disappearing playback controls, lost ability to properly self pause when other app plays sounds",0
"Love it. Any song,any genre,any era it's there. Brilliant",1
Very good app for listening music at anytime 101 out of 100,1
Ihave the best collection of classics due to spotify,1
"The music playing bar has disappeared as and I can't skip or pause my music, it's super annoying. Had been happening for a couple of months or more and is updated.",0
"there's a lot of repetitive ads, lots of glitches, the app will randomly stop for no reason, 1-3 minutes worth of ads between every two songs and then there's the ad that says ""enjoy your 30 minutes of ad-free music"" and it plays like two songs with yet again ANOTHER AD. it's a good app sometimes but other times it's annoying.",0
"Once I bought premium, it was just luxury listening. Sheer brilliance in the recommended playlists. I couldn't have paid less for such an experience, magical.",1
Any other music app os better than this,0
"Great App to have all the music you wish and all the music you did't know you would like in your hand - BUT SPOTIFY NEEDS TO STOP HATRED, RACISM, SEXISM, etc. ALSO IN PODCASTS ! YOU ARE SUPPORTING THE DIVISION OF OUR SOCIETIES !",1
Ilove this,1
"Only here for Joe Rogan. Used to listen to him before spotify, but now with this obsured cancel nonsense I downloaded this app ONLY to listen to Joe again.",0
"This is a lousy amateur app. Nothing but problems. Spotify will no longer work with Alexa so downloaded app to see if this would work. Won't allow me to sign in. Keeps sending me links that expire straight away. A professional outfit should do better than this. For these reasons, Spotify App has Junk Status. Not Recommended!!",0
ðŸ™‚so much ad,0
The product exceeds expectations whoever it is difficult to use when you are new to the program.,1
Unstable ui in Android,0
Your recommended playlists ðŸ’¥ intense people good. Job,1
Great quality and awesome service,1
Has all of my favorite songs and its easy to use also i use spotify when i go to ohio like i did last weekend it was fun because i got use spotify but some people don know how to use spotify like my mom but to day i talt her and now she uses it when shes in the car now to,1
"Its been a week since I've got this problem where I can't open the app, it's just a black screen with the Spotify logo in the middle, please fix it as soon as possible, I really enjoy the app",0
"Awesome layout and very easy on the eyes, love it and recommend for those who love there music loud. Thank you.",1
I do not like the ads,0
"Since update the app will stop playing music at random intervals. Really annoying when I'm at work gowned up in PPE and can't access my phone to turn it back on again. This is a real inconvenience, please fix it quickly (Samsung note 20 ultra)",0
"A couple days ago it started working weirdly. Many times the app is playing music, but I don't see the controls nor in the notifications panel, nor inside the app itself (as if music wasn't playing). I have to shut the app down in order for it to reset and start working correctly again. You'll get your 5 stars back when this is solved",0
Way too unstable and buggy on Android 12. Not enough options for customisation. The change from showing album covers to showing artist background images when playing through a TV was a terrible decision. It's ridiculous that a service this big with this much money behind it has actually become worse during the years.,0
Best app for podcasts! It gets a bit glitchy sometimes and occasionally have to clear the cache and restart my android phone which is annoying. But I'll still stick with it because everything else is great.,1
This is being a great app for music and podcast I have been using this app for many years now I have re installed it spotify is giving me little problem in listening for the podcast and playlist it's not opening my playlist so can you please just clear this problem otherwise the Apple great love this app â¤,1
The app is kinda an advertising app not for songs. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ™‚,0
App works great. Many features.,1
spotify doesn't always work and I had to create a whole new account to get premium,0
Love being able to listen to all the music I love.,1
I love Spotify but the Playlist/shuffle thing is really stupid I try playing songs and It's playing random songs,0
Proudly cancelled my subscription and deleted this app from my phone. Spotify pushes misinformation by allowing Joe Rogen to remain on their platform. My family and I will be switching to Apple Music. Apple gave us 6 months free anyways!!!!,0
Desktop is just simply superior. I don't know why I'd ever use mobile when I can't even select a specific song.,1
App is working really poorly. Controls disappear. Sound keeps playing after disconnection from Bluetooth. Have to restart the app frequently. More and more adds appearing in the podcasts.,0
"Music is good, but Joe Rogan and his lies have to go.",1
"This app is fine if you are listening on WiFi, but even with all my music downloaded and a premium subscription it will not play in offline mode.",0
"Podcast switches episodes when ads finish. When you go back to the episode you were listening too, it restarts from the beginning",0
Gives me the motivation to do it ðŸ’ª ðŸ™Œ âœ¨ï¸ ðŸ’¯ ðŸ˜Œ. If you have any balls get some if you dare..,1
I like the app it's very much easy to get the music you what,1
Buggy. Search bar won't work properly,0
Excellent music app,1
Love it!!! Works everywhere I go!,1
Excellent,1
"I honestly hate it when i get random songs that i didnt even ask for, the ads, keep coming everytime when i finish 2-3 songs telling me to buy spotify prem, also i turned off the option where it would not add in random songs in my playlist, yet it does on my phone, fix ur stuff on phone, stop focusing on money",0
I mostly enjoy the app. I have over 4000 songs downloaded. Recently the option to shuffle play has disappeared and it plays the same songs over and over. I knew that I can make playlists but again it's the same thing over and over.,0
The app won't play the song I choose. The idea seems to be to annoy someone into buying the premium. Not gonna happen like that. App deleted.,0
I con't find defferent -defferent language songs on this app:::,0
Love the music and my Playlist.,1
"Better than Pandora, but still lacking. Recent updates make it so you can't preview songs before adding to your playlists, which is frustrating. The recommended songs in playlists are now mostly songs that are already on your playlist, super helpful. Hopefully bugs that will be fixed in 6-9 months (sarcasm, but is it?)",0
"Yes , i have not purchased Spotify premium but u know the ads are crazy. I was listening to one song and in between there were 3 ads and after each song change there are 2 ads.. Fed up with the ads.. Please don't show too much ads . I was uninstalling your app at once but I am writing this to you. Hope you will understand the situation and take action as soon as possible.Thank you..",0
"Best app to see the songs , but the lyrics are not correct pls change that",0
The app doesn't work.When i open app i see just spotify logo and it doesn't go,0
"I have always adored spotify! I pay for premium, but I must say the whole ""hide this song"" option is getting really annoying being right beside save and add to Playlist. I have accidentally hid songs I've been trying to save and add to playlist",0
This is my mainstream music app for years but suddenly it became so buggy can't open it properly.,0
"Have been a premium member since the beginning. Have now decided to cancel subscription. Too many issues with music stopping randomly or the app crashing and telling me theres no internet connection so can't even get into anything. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, updating my mobile, restarting my mobile and nothing's worked.",0
Constant crashes just minutes between each other. Started yesterday 4/19/22.,0
"I opened am account and took premium. I gave a Nedbank account as a method of payment. But then my phone has a problem and has to be flushed as they said. Hence lost my Spotify acc. I tried to retrieve it but in vain and opened another one. I have another acc. So now, I don't know which account is active.",0
"If you are switching betn songs the app just starts hanging and doesn't respond for almost 3 minutes or so.. Spotify, just for the sake of getting premium customers do not let your name go down the drain.",0
"Rating 1 star, reason: normally Spotify has 6 daily limited skips and locked to shuffle for any playlist. This means you CAN NOT listen to podcasts in order unless you buy Spotify premium. I'd honestly rather go back to soundcloud then continue on Spotify",0
Love the app,1
the song keeps stopping. i press another song when a song is playing and the entire app glitches and no songs begin to play,0
,1
I am really upset i am use Spotify for years but now whenever i try to open such to right a new song name it got exit please do something on this,0
"I love Spotify. However for the last year, it likes to crash at random. Music is playing and it will just stop. Toggling between apps seems like a trigger, but overall is very sporadic and randomly crashing ðŸ˜ðŸ˜”",0
I downloaded the app and i have 5 g data and full bars on my wifi that was green and it still said no conection please fix this because i only want to listen to music but i cant,0
Duplicates in my Liked Songs. Unliking one will remove both from the library. Reinstalling does not help at all. It's getting really annoying.,0
NICE,1
This app is great except I am having this bug where when I try to go backwards in the middle of a song it still continues to play the song instead of going back. And vice versa.,0
Audio quality is low compared to resso please improve,0
Was working fine until it updated. Now music sometimes stops when on Bluetooth and no visible player. Samsung S10.,0
Need to vary the ads more.,0
Great. Lots of different varieties of music. Not interrupted with ads,1
Garbage absolute garbage I I got logged out I tried to log back in I couldn't I had It send me an email I didn't get an email so I logged in to my free account and I can't listen to my playlist,0
"Premium is too expensive, but overall a solid 8.7/10",1
Best music service ever,1
"My Spotify is randomly pausing my music for a few seconds before playing again. If I play a song, it sometimes doesn't bring up the music player at the bottom or highlight the song that is playing. Please fix this.",0
I can't log in or reset password,0
What have you done with the latest update? Spotify now randomly stops playing and interaction with Bluetooth devices is unreliable. I can't pause/skip etc. from my head phones or Bluetooth speaker.,0
Very buggy since the last update. Music status bar will disappear but the music keeps playing. It was working fine till last update. Pls fix!,1
great,1
Useless uncloseable pop ups. The get the better experience popup asking me to enable bluetooth even though its enabled doesnt turn off. Surely this is an easy fix for something that causes constant notifications upon opening? Such a simple thing to fix. Its enabled. Everything is. Still there. Staring at me. Deep into my soulless heart. Fix pls,0
All of a sudden spotify won't play songs for more than 2 seconds have to keep clearing cache and uninstalling and reinstalling app,0
"Brilliant, can control it 9n mobile while gaming on pc can even turn volume up and down and don't have to pause game",1
"Takes a long time for something to play, pauses randomly and says no online connection when my connection is fine",0
"By far the WORST!!! music playing app ever you can only get to skip 6 songs before having to wait, you get advertisements every 3/4 songs you play, when listening to your liked songs they just throw in some random songs to listen that you've never heard before plus you can't listen to a song you've saved just by tapping on it you have to play shuffle and then go by skipping through them all until you eventually come accross the song you were looking for...would have gave this 0 stars if i could.",0
"If I pay for an ad free experience, I expect my content to be ad free. Spotify double-dipping and forcing me to listen to ads on podcasts, even though I pay for a premium subscription, is a disappointing display of unnecessary greed. That coupled with the fact that downloadable, offline listening is a promised feature that almost NEVER works makes me wonder why I have a subscription in the first place.",0
Good,1
Why the hell does it keep saying I'm offline when I'm not.. Works on mobile data but not in wifi still plays songs but I can't search for artists,0
It's amazing no 1 app to listen a music with good quality,1
"""Your Offline..."" UHH NO I'M NOT!! HOW COME 'YMUSIC' IS FREE FROK YMUSIC.IO AND WORKS!! And this app is constantly broken!!? I'm connected it works!",0
"It's not a bad app, but I don't like when I'm listening to songs on my playlist or in my favourites and other songs outside the playlist is playing. I've also noticed that you can't select a song anymore so I just have to shuffle. It's not fun",0
"I really enjoy Spotify. I listen to music, podcasts, etc. Anywhere, anytime.",1
The app is good but i turned off auto play and i have over 15 songs in my playlist and it wont stop playing suggested songs i even restarted and uninstalled the app and it wont stop playing suggested songs,0
"Trash absolute trash. Deletes all Downloads, very slow to load. Burned 13Gigs of my 15gig available data even when i set the downloads to wifi only...logs me out of the app randomly and cant get back in despite renewing passwords...i want my money back. Apr16,2022 App keeps logging out, malfunctioning, deleting songs downloaded, or moves them from SD card to internal memory. Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone etc and it constantly does the same thing. This app sucks.",0
"REALLY, 5 ads after each song? I'm pissed off. Until you fix this I'm going to change my rate.",0
GUI SUCKS CANT DELETE RECENTLY PLAYED FILES ON MY LAPTOP OR CELLULAR APP.,0
"App isn't working any more, no mini play in my notification bar and pauses when playing, no control bar in app either.",0
Wonderful! Awesome! Spectacular!,1
"Recently has sooo many bugs... I have been a premium user for around 8 years but in the last year the app has become very annoying, to the point I am now thinking of cancelling my subscription for one of the competitors",0
It's the best app ever saved me when I was at my lowest.. and am so gratis...,1
Spotify is great just lately there's a problem on android where if you go to open your notifications while the screen is locked it'll shift the lock screen player for spotify to the right and it becomes unusable. Sometimes force quitting the app will fix it othertimes I have to Uninstall and reinstall. Any permanent fix?,0
I can't find podcasts in my app.. is that available for srilanka?,0
Do you need to describe why Spotify is the best app? There are always some issues(ads :/ ) but it's very efficient.,1
Excellent  Music App,1
"Better than Apple itunes by far. More music different styles of music ðŸŽ¶ absolutely worth $9.99 a month I don't listen to my radio or pay for XM radio when I can listen to anything without commercials and radio talk. I like apple music. But nothing beats"" Spotify""!!!!",0
Awesome clearlty.. add some Sunday Suspense..,1
"The latest update messed up everything. The song I searched for never plays instead the playlist start on its own. Also, the playlist I have created is not showing the selected songs but showing the recommendations.",0
Will just turn itself on whenever Bluetooth is connected regardless if the app is open or even playing at the time. Entirely obnoxious and unwanted. I'm uninstalling the app right now,0
After updating the volume start to decrease and increase on its own.,1
Nice app if you are a music lover. All the best team Spotify. Pls add some more hindi film songs old albums.,1
"Thanks Spotify, I'm enjoying old memories funk,soul,Jimmy hendrix so on so on.",1
I really enjoy using Spotify,1
"Functional but setting the order of music is not easy. And for some reason the six albums/pieces that I _first_ selected after installation months ago, are still the six ""recent"" selections.",0
Its really good yrr I loved it this apps Is just wow,1
My girlfriend just wants to listen to the same song but can't there should be a feature to where you can listen to the same song over and over again,0
Not happy about ads but generally very happy ðŸ˜Š,1
"It's a really good app if you want to listen to music. the reason I gave four stars instead of five stars is because I thought that it was offline so that I could listen to it to music offline, but it wasn't offline so.. but other than that it's a really good app.",1
"Idk why but I don't have lyrics on my app ðŸ˜… before I have that, but after I uninstall and install it again, it's gone. I install uninstall it again, erase the cache, and the data, I still don't have it. The spotify app version in my phone is 8.7.18...... Idk if it's because of my phone or what? ðŸ˜… but all in all, I like it, its great just missing the lyrics",0
"My experience with this app has been really good. The app is well optimised and runs well. If there's anything I didn't like or want this app to have is the ability to tell Spotify to play random similar songs even if it's playing in the playlist. And secondly, introduce local stats or something which could tell me what people near me are listening to on Spotify!",1
I have gotten 10 ads in a row trying to listen to a single song. The ads were longer then the sond,0
It won't let me listen to or pick my Playlist songs anymore I don't know why,0
Great but with update it sometimes glitches and you have to like restart you phone to get it to show what it's playing properly,0
Good,1
"Podcasts haven't updated from before new year, that's nearly a month now. I used to get new Podcasts from my favourite shows daily. I've uninstalled and tried again multiple times. Cleared caches. Gone through forums. Waste of money if you can't listen to new content.",0
"Terrible. This app stops and starts randomly, and the widget stopped working for some reason",0
Really good best app ,1
I absolutely love Spotify,1
Make it so either there is no recommend songs or make it so they won't play the songs it recommend(I forgot how to edit reviews so I deleted and remade),0
My music has been glitching recently which is a bit annoying just hoping it's fixed soon spotify is the best. It won't show the banner along the bottom of the current song playing and will stop playing music randomly.,0
I cant change the song and if i click song i want it changes to other song i dont know and too many ad pls do improvement.,0
It used to be good then they started serving literally 6 ads every 4 songs (sometimes.),0
This app is okay but you turn off similar songs to be played. Spotify still plays them. 1 star for lack of functionality on their part.,0
I like that I can create my own playlists and there's a wide variety of music to choose from,1
i love it this is the best place where you can be able to listen to your favorite music,1
very great app and not too expensive to go âœ¨premiumâœ¨,1
I love using this app so much. Ever since my radios intena broke I use Spotify and listen to my like songs playlist and the fact it cycles through the songs you like makes it great because you never know which of your favorite songs will pop up next.,1
loveitt,1
Nices,1
"Pls... I'm fine withe the rest, just fix the play/pause, forward and backward button. It was fine before. Now it just triggers me cause. a. It's not symmetrical, b. It doesn't even match the (much better) design when you visit the queue, stop making the UI ugly and worse. There wasn't even a good reason I could think of that you guys would do that.",0
My app is installed and now it's saying no internet connection...... What's the matter?,0
I will not use any other app or music besides Spotify so I thank you and God bless,1
Super duper app.. amazing songs even u have gujarati songs and bhajans too ...that ur competative app doesn't have.. thanks,0
"Great at finding songs, and making recommendations.",1
The lyrics don't sync right . Probably after the new update.,0
"There's a bug that I've been experiencing for over a month now. When you play a song in a long playlist, sometimes the volume will just turn low directly, and sometimes the song just keeps playing in Spotify but not in the background.",0
Easy favourites and good suggestions,1
"It's good, easy to use, but the ads just pop up when I'm listening to the music even though my phone is off",0
Best app to listen songs very original interface nice quality,1
"Like the app, running good. Missing one option tho to play or stuffle All library. If that was fixed then maybe it world be 5/5 stars.",0
It would have been five stars if you didn't remove neil young's cortez the killer from my playlist... i loved that song,1
"Spotify is evil. It's owned by the music industry. This is their way of paying the artist they already barely pay even less. And don't forget, the crumbs that they pay the artist from Spotify is still 75% their. So when they ""pay"" an artist a dollar the artist gets .25 cents and they keep the rest. Spotify is the most disgusting thing these greedy record companies could come up with. They already rape their artist and take all the money they make in exchange for doing nothing at all.",0
"If you're always making changes, and improving, then tell us what you changed and improved. The 10,000 song limit is stupid ridiculous. Also, minus 1 more star for never telling us specifically what changes and improvements have been made. Can you at least link to a blog or something?",0
"I used to enjoy the app a lot more even though it's been glitchy and laggy from time to time but now I have to deal with advertisements every two songs, 3 if I'm lucky. And not just 1 or 2 ads but 3-4 ads and the same ones over and over again. So for every half an hour I listen I hear like 10+ ads and it gets old fast. When I skip a song or change channels it goes straight to ads again, so I feel stuck listening to something I don't want to so as to avoid the same ads yet again.",0
I've had a better experience since the bugs were fixed in the Google Assistant. I have to agree Spotify is the best place to listen to music any any genre..anytime anywhere!!,1
"I'd been a premium member and no problem until this recent update. When I'm online, my other offline devices cannot play offline/downloaded songs. Please fix it.",0
"I have crashes almost daily. Things play well out of order. I have to close and force stop the app daily. If this doesn't change, I'll be canceling my premium account. The only good thing I can say is at least I can download stuff, but I can probably do it somewhere else.",0
Nice app Easy selection of song's.,1
Lot's of advertisement.......... One song one advertisement ðŸ¥´ðŸ¥²,0
Its good but the ads are annoying,0
Best music app ever I take back 2 stars because the ads are getting really ridiculous,0
ðŸ’¯ Easy to use and enjoyable ðŸ’• Just got free premium for 3 months! I highly recommend!!,1
10/5 professional Spotify dickrider here. I come in my pants every time I open the app.,0
Wish that the app was like the computer version so you can pick what song you want without having to have premium,0
Spot On! Thank you for all the jams tunes and songs that help me get along! Bong Bong Spotify till I Fly!,1
Very nice i can listen to all BTS music and also lyrics to say them ðŸ™‚ that's why 5 stars,1
"The last update has a problem, when I pick a track to play it does not show, only play so it can't be stopped or skipped unless the app is killed",0
Worth the money. You can enjoy music anywhere and everywhere.,1
It keeps on crashing ðŸ˜­ I can't use it without the song stopping every minute or so. Super disappointed,0
"Nice, you have nice songs almost all the categories.",1
"ABSOLUTE TRASH ON MOBILE. All I wanted to do was make a Playlist of 4 songs and play it. Didn't even play a single song of mine and just kept playing random ""similar"" songs, song after song. After I had to waste time googling for a fix. Found the fix and turned off ""autoplay similar songs."" Still didn't play my Playlist songs. TRASH ON MOBILE. Not to mention I remade the Playlist from scratch about 5 times and it still didn't play a single song of mine.",0
NICE ONE,1
This is the best app that I have ever seen and listening to music from this app is an good experience,1
There are every song in it and thank you spotify ðŸ¤—,1
"It's supposed updates are to improve the application, not worsening, I cannot see the controls to pause, forward, etc., even if I am using the headphones there are moments when it gets stuck, the only way to recover is to force stop the application from settings in my cell phone",0
great a+ best free music even better when you hop on a afamily plan 3 Gold Stars,1
It's actually good if you are a premium user,1
Very easy to use for an oldie who just started .thanks. Martin.,1
"Uhm what? I've been using Spotify for over 5 years and today while I was listening to my music I noticed that the â®ï¸ â–¶ï¸ â­ï¸ button layout have changed and personally I do not like it at all. I do not know whether it is a glitch or something that can be fixed, but please return it back to normal as it looks like this now â–¶ï¸â®ï¸â­ï¸. â™¥ï¸",0
Keeps crashing. All the time.,0
This app is good but there is lots of ads ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„,1
I'm greatful that even if you haven't subscribed yet they still play some of my fave songs everyone need a spotify music in this lifeeeeee ðŸ¦‹â™¥ï¸,1
Please fix the bugs that the app is experiencing. It's almost at the point to terminate my subscription,0
The app hasn't opened for me in over two weeks despite reinstalling it and all kinds of trouble shooting. I share a duo premium account with my partner and his app is working fine. My screen is and continues to be blank. Thumbs down,0
"It's good ðŸ‘ but I think there is so much more to improve on like improving the search results section, adding a interactive time line etc.",0
Spotify is very good but one thing is too many ads in between when we are listening to music and the songs version is a problem when it is in korean and after few months if the artist sang them in other versions even the korean version will be changed and it won't be available in korean version. Hoping that this problem will be cleared soon. I gave you 4stars and after clearing I will give 5 stars. And the songs will play even in background. If they are not playing it is your phone prblm not app,0
It doesn't play the music I selected,0
Spotify is AWESOME!,1
Lately Spotify has been cutting in and out between listening to songs. Could someone please fix this?? I reinstalled it and still had the same issue.,0
"I dont know whether i am using this app for listening music or listening to adds!! After ever 60 seconds of addd, if i change the 2-3 song quickly, it gives the yt shorts add again withing fur seconds.. it seems like i would have to uninstall this app. Cause its really annoying.",0
Very good app all songs my favourite,1
This is the worst app Im making playlist and it keeps adding stupid music that I don't want in my playlist this is a 0.5/10,0
Everything is awesome . Although your premium is little expensive but i still have it. Myy only concern is when you guys gonna fix mic drop option. It will change Spotify totally . Its awesome. I tried once i dont remember it worked for one song . Now its useless,1
Nice app to play music and at very affordable price,1
I like the app. But why have you been restricting Neil Young songs?,0
"I don't normally have issues with the app, I subscribe, but my phone just did the update and now I can't use the Spotify feature on my pioneer headunit. I need to roll back the update.",0
Efficient and accurate,1
"Easy to use , works great !",1
App has consistent glitches.,0
"I'm glad I can listen to my favourite podcasts but this whole you have to pay all of a sudden to listen to a song you like, that is not worth it, i suggest you take a step down with the latest update",0
"I want to know what happend the collaborative button because now i cant add songs on others people's playlist. I updated it many times but the collabrative button wont pop up, and also can you guys put a spotify chat system on there its gettin really boring trying to talk by putting songs on other people's playlist Overall its great.",0
The app is bugged out. So many unexplained app crashes. So often does the player display the wrong visual content to audio. So many connection issues. I like spotify but you guys need to take a serious look at these issues with your app. Honestly expected more from a company that can afford to advertise world wide but can't get main platform in order. D I S A P P O I N T E D,0
I been on Spotify for years. Continue to build with multiple classics...,1
Really good. The music is awesome the podcasts are great . But the only problem I have is that the ads are coming in the middlecofxa song and it kinda makes me mad but other than that it's a pretty good app and it's totally worth trying!ðŸ˜ƒ,1
"Great music app. One thing I do not like is they took away the download button, though. Otherwise, I enjoy the service.",1
"Spotify was awesome up until recently. When I have spotify playing and go to play another media source (youtube, instagram, etc.) Spotify will not stop playing. When I go back to the app the ""tab"" that allows you to pause music is missing. I end up having to manually force it to stop. I have Uninstalled Spotify and reinstalled it and it doesn't help. There are no new updates. Almost to the point of quitting Spotify altogether.",0
"What's with your availing premium service, it keeps bugging and saying to try again, how many times try, anyway? YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY, THEN MAKE A LOT IMPROVEMENT WITH YOUR APP AS WELL. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY EXTEND THE EXPIRY DATE FOR A WEEK WOULD BE BETTER. STILL MY FAVE STREAMING APP. THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY 3AM.",0
"How can u take album art off jvc kenwood car stereos ,I loved this app because that feature ,was going to get the platnum but now I'd rather listen to my music through bloothtooth app on stereo ,worked totally fine for so long then nothing ,why? It was one of its best features, but until it's fixed then it's Bluetooth for me ,at least I can skip songs on Bluetooth instead of just seeing connecting on screen ,very disappointed and I'm sure there's at least 2 million that agree ,your loss",0
"From my point of view.. This app is awesome... Well maintained UI, dark theme, variety of songs, millions of playlist and more... Can try an awesome app for music, soundtracks, podcasts and more... One thing which is missing is we can't download songs. Rest is fine",0
Nice app to listen a music,1
I recommend Spotify over anyother Music and Audio app. Has everything I need.,1
"I don't know why but I can't see the lyrics of songs in but in my friends phone, they can see the lyrics.",0
"Simple, and user friendly. The adaptive personal experience is spot on (pun intended).",0
"Really ticked at you guys- first you're putting all these songs on my list that if I delete them, accounts against me and then my favorite playlist I've created disappears. I started working more recently and was going to upgrade but I'm probably going elsewhere for that now.",0
This app insulting their users by their annoying ads..they force their users for buying their so called premium pack..and ads play continuously 3 ads together...this app not for middle class peoples...this app now days become too much annoying...just ads or ads back to back...,0
"great service, easy to use and tons of music to play!",1
Great app. Sometimes glitches and the controls don't work so I have to keep listening without skipping songs. Normally good though.,0
I love SPOTIFY SO MUCH!! The only prob is if you have a playlist it shuffle and you can't pick a song in the phone so please fix thisâ¤,0
Best music streaming if you have premium,1
You can find amazing songs!You can find ur favourite artist,1
Great music choices and easy-to-use,1
"Please fix this app, why do I get only 6 skips per hour, and why does it always shuffle my songs when I try to listen to a playlist, and why can't I listen to a song before I put it in my playlist but I suppose spotify never listens the the reviews",0
I love spotify but i get irritated because when i play then after 2 songs or even halfway of a song that's currently playing it stops it literally stops and when i get back to open the app the song restarts so i need to play it again or skip it and waste my free skips please fix this it's not like this before i enjoy using spotify but with this i really get irritated,0
Love this music app!,1
I pay money for it to constantly glitch out. Spotify fix your trash.,0
Amazing app and every step you make with mind thinkfull..,1
So far still loving the app it's very easy finding the songs I like and I love the fact that I can play my Playlist offline,1
where is your github this update isn't the move- I can't find ANYTHING and I HATE the UX. I need to submit a bug report asap your app is INFURIATING. Recent update is TRASH. The new pull down search in liked songs doesn't find anything at all. You removed my super zoom scrolling button and I want it back. Shopping for another music application or an emulator to access the library without your horrid UX update. Thank you for ruining a good thing by removing my sidescrolling dot.,0
This is by far the best music app I've ever used. Yes there are glitches but I'm not going to be fixated on that . Sound quality is superb and search engine great . And I have no issue with adds . For what we pay how can we complain ? Thank you Spotify,1
"Considering Spotifys current position on continuing to allow Joe Rogan to push anti-vax messaging and favoring him over other artists, I will be cancelling my membership immediately. It is a shame because I generally enjoy the app, but the only way to enact meaningful change is via a Boycott. So there it is.",0
"We are paying premium account to give support to the artists we like and yet you can't assure us to fix the hacking problem we've all been experiencing. Account holders have been calling you out for quite sometime now. But still got no response or acknowledgement. I find it unfair, It is very disappointing to be honest.",0
"This is the only app I've used that constantly tells me I'm not connected to the internet when I am. I have no other problems with this with other apps so what's you're problem? Do you think I enjoy messing with my wifi all of the time because your app can't connect on its own? Also, I'm already premium so stop trying to upsell me and allowing ads on podcasts.",0
Now playing progressing bar not showing and working. Please solve this problem.ðŸ˜ ,0
App stopped working 3 days ago and keeps displaying 'no Internet connection' when every other Internet based app on my phone is working. I have uninstalled the app several times and now can't even sign in. I just hope its a glitch in the system that would be resolved soon.,0
It's good it just begs you to buy premium and I tried to make a playlist and for some reason it never even plays the songs in a new playlist it plays recommended random songs that aren't even close to what I'm listening to like cmon man,0
I like the Spotify app but really you have to get premium to listen to any song you want no I think that's just straight up dumb. So Spotify if you read this review can you please get rid of shuffle play at least make it optional please and I'll upgrade from two stars to four stars. Since you don't want to respond I'm going to give you one star. Fix your app can't you see by the reviews that people don't like it fix your dumb app!! Maybe I might install your app but until then you lost someone.,0
There should be an option to remove songs which we don't like from auto generated playlists.,0
"Love the music, New school to Old school selections & the quality when streaming my music on my electronic devices. Quick and convient. I really recommend Spotify over Pandora Radio.",1
Very very poor customer experience and even worse customer service. Bug ridden and no communication on fixes.,0
I have been using this app for music in my car for almost 3 years now and I can say that I have no issue with this app since I got premium. I can easily just add songs to my playlist and itll download them automatically. I love this app best app for listening to music. Even more better is that it even offers hindi songs apart from english!!! I love it i hope it stays this way!,1
My most favorite app but ads are just getting on my nerves. Like you know everyone cannot take premium so I am humbling requesting you to please give less ads. Ads are coming after every two songs which really destroy the mood and vibe.,0
Easy to manage and organize songs and audio quality is superb. Vast collection of music..,1
"How can an app so old be so broken! Now playing pop-up keeps disappearing and I have to reinstall the app every time to bring it back, why just not have the navigation buttons permanently at the bottom bar??? With Full HD+ screens it shouldn't be such a problem, would it?",0
Exceptional. Large variety of programming options.,1
Worst app I donno but everytime I play a song it suddenly stops working and I uninstalled this app then installed I update this app every time but again after one day it stops working . And this is happening with me from more than 6 months I am sure I'm not gonna install this app again !!!,0
I cant take off shuffle because its not a option,0
Best app for music but ads are annoying ðŸ™‚,0
Ads during podcasts even on premium! Disgusting! Does not allow podcast video to play when connected to Bluetooth speaker or earbud! Managed to find a workaround by switching off android Bluetooth device connection options (found under Bluetooth in settings) then turning them back on. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED THIS ON THE SPOTIFY COMMUNITY. It's blindingly obvious it needs to be fixed. Why the heck are there ads on premium during podcasts!? Unbelievable.,0
"Love the sound quality with premium. Years of experiencing new genres and the moment when the app goes astray, day or night, the support team is available to assist.",1
"It's worthless without premium. Can't loop songs, get limited skips, can't rewind or fast forward songs, no selecting songs. You don't get any of this if you aren't on a laptop or premium.",0
"It won't stop playing suggested songs, i want to listen to my albums but it plays songs I have never heard of, please correct this.!",1
The app is fine i just HATE when it plays another song thats not even in your playlist. Like Sis NoðŸ˜”âœŒï¸,0
This app won't let me play the song that I chose. It plays random song no matter what I chose. DON'T INSTALL AND LOOK FOR OTHER MUSIC APP.,0
annoying glitches all the time. But has most of my music and I like the Playlist it makes so I put up with it,1
"Hi spotify when I listen to my favorite songs, I'm getting poor play back quality. The songs are freezing right in the middle of the song. And it's not just one song, it's doing it every time I listen to the app. I tried Un installing the app, then opening it up again but no difference. I won't need to continue Spotify premium, hopefully this gets fixed so I can come back to enjoy my songs.",0
"Update: This app is becoming more and more terrible, may move to other streaming service soon. Original post: Thanks for reminding me to review Spotify. This app has gone really downhill lately and pretty much every update is accompanied by bugs, songs not playing, queues disappearing, new features not working.... Focus on getting the basics of music playing right rather than unnecessary features that no one cares about.",0
Love the variety of music and all the podcasts and more choices available.,1
Why doesn't this app work on Roku (I've already deleted and reinstalled)?,0
App is unresponsive with frequent freezes and crashes. Unreliability makes frustrating to use what is meant to be a paid service. Update: with a new phone many of the glitches apear to be fixed however still experience the occasional graphical ui error.,0
Too many ads but with premium it's good.,1
I had no idea what a Podcast was lol then then I listened listen to Downton Abbey Podcast and I loved it.. As a housewife I just put it on turn it up and walk around doing my work and my work and listening to it it's fantastic!,1
Most recent update has broken the app on the S9. 50% of the time you lose the ability to see whats currently playing and skip songs.,0
Great way to listen to music,1
I don't use this app much often but it good because my opinion matters and yours does not,1
"I'm started using spotify long time ago.It's very supportive app.I'm giving 5 stars.Because,Once i tired of a playlist there're lot more to listen everytime.Everyday listening to New,trending songs is my favorite hobby now.Thanks to spotify. â¤ï¸",1
"Don't like the way you have to get premium for almost everything in mobile, but in pc there is no problem except for the ads. Other than that there is no problem.",1
"Fun, good music selection",1
App keeps opening by itself,1
"Suddenly the app is ""no longer compatible with your device"". I wonder why spotify is suddenly not for the recent Galaxy",0
Doesn't work when connected to Wifi. Always shows no internet connection.,0
"Bad app. But it is usefull for enterprises, because if you want to advertise come. Here. So many users all though there is more ads. Ths is not a 'songs' app, this is a advertising appðŸ˜‘. If you listen one song. Then next comes a dozen ads. There was a special occasion In my house, for that occasion i played music in this app and connected to my bluetooth speakerðŸ˜‘ then the fun part comes, it was played at th maximum. Volume, after one song sudenly there comes. The. Ad. ðŸ˜‘ My parents:****stop***",0
"This app is good not had to connect, just I can't download the music",0
"Great and all, but, I was wondering if I can play my playlists without the shuffle system.. plus, Spotify just added songs randomly and sometime those songs are boring. I don't use premium so I'm unsure and don't know anything more. Dw, despite my star review, this is a recommended place to listen to ur liking songs.",1
Most entertaining and user friendly good app...,1
This app is very hard to use! Why are there only 3 skips per day? Why are there so many adds in a music app? So stupid!,0
Very simple to use and it's music ðŸ™‚,1
Best app for podcasts ....best suggestion.but the ads are annoying so Spotify make sure you reduce the amount of ads,0
Easy to use. So much choice too.,0
I love Spotify but why isn't it letting me trial songs? Like for example when I'm adding new songs and you can click them so they play a little bit of the song and you see if you like it or not. WHY IS IT NOT LETTING ME DO THAT I NEED THAT FEATURE,1
Best music app I ever used foreals ! Always finding the songs I want an more ! An the playlist they be making !! Sheesh slaps for days !ðŸ’¯ðŸ™ðŸ”¥ðŸŽ§,1
Good collection of songs,1
"I honestly really don't like this app. On a phone, spotify adds songs to your playlist, FYI I hate the songs they add, YOU CAN'T EVEN LISTEN TO ONE SONG without having to listen to a WHOLE PLAYLIST. SO much advertisements. Ugh i hate it so much. This is a scam you have to download premium to be able to do simple stuff like skip a song or listen to one song. It's literally just a scam for money, I don't reccomend installing Spotify",0
Only problem is changed Samsung phones and now I can't seem to hear music due to no wifi when out doors smh,0
This app is getting worse by the day. The ads are unbearable. The albums are full of remixed nonsense. The devs stop caring since the app blew up.,0
"I love this app alot but I'm having some problems from last 3 months it says ""no internet connection available"" I'm always connected to the wifi bit still, other apps works but it doesn't I want you to fix this as soon as possible please",0
Nice,1
"There is some glitch going on, songs lag and the song you are currently playing shows nowhere",0
I didn't like the new update that makes me skip six songs in one hour Also making one play one song without repeat sucks for me,0
Who is releasing these updates to the app without testing them? Current version of the app doesn't show 'now playing' and will play over other audio and has no pause button to press.,0
"It says after ads, 30 minutes of ad free music. However, have experience of ads as short as 10 minutes",0
"I'm giving a 4 star cause it was flawlessly working before it just twice deleted all my downloads in a space of 4 days. Good job, Please fix this",0
Excellent access to a massive library of music,1
very good application... the quality and variety of music is spectacular.,1
"Love it, premium user. Worth every cent!! Some minor issues with the app suddenly closing and when I log back in all my songs need to be downloaded again, but the pro's outweigh the con's tenfold â¤",0
the best streaming service these days ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¼ but... i have to give away one star because it can't swipe down from now-playing page to go back home.,0
Very Good Music App,1
"Listening to the music That I like at any time and within reach of my fingers, great application!!",1
Its very good we can search any song on it you have to also try it,1
Really upset because my playlist suddenly got erased from most recent,0
Humanity's fundamental right of free speetch is protected by this app alone! My heroes! Plus the music is fire!ðŸ”¥ Podcast selection is fire!ðŸ”¥ 10/10! Thank you devs.,1
Spotify is a great app.,1
Horrible I can't access playlists or get to skip a song I don't like if u had skipped it 6 times in that hour do u know how annoying that is do not get this unless you want to spend money to get more than 6 skips and be able to listen to songs without having to listen to the previews only. I clicked on a song and then another song came on and it's really frustrating please fix this,0
"I love it! It's a good app, just that it has a lot of ads.",1
"Nice listening habit developed, mostly original song by original singer unless new version & artist..",0
The best from music to podcasts,1
Due to certain unfortunate unforeseen circumstances I am on a data plan that only has 2 GB which I ran out of right away just activating the phone in general but Spotify has let me play my music continuously so it barely uses any data and they have all the good songs that I look for 99% of the time I give this app a five star for now,0
"Used this music app for years and i would recommend it, Alan",1
"Honestly I've been using this app for a long time but now, I've gone through all the ads multiple times the hundreds of ads every two songs there's more ads than music at this point.",0
"Freezing constantly and loads the wrong song selected (but never plays it) what are you, hourly?",0
I love this app I definitely recommend for those who don't like adds in the middle of their songs and/or podcasts. I can find all the songs I like on Spotify that is why I gave it a 5 start review. Totally recommend ðŸ‘Œ!,1
"With spotify it's not difficult to listen to music, it only gets better with the premium version because you can even listen to it offline. It helps a lot when I am stressed",1
I like the YouTube music app better. Just my preference.,0
I LOVVVEEEE SPOTIFY!! Spotify is just the most amazing music app it beats any other one I love the lyrics that where recently added. I recommend this app so much!!,1
I wish that the free version was a little bit like the premium i now that how is supposedly to be but we can't even download songs. Or why we can't skip more than 6 songs in a hour? but anyway i like the app keep the good work,1
Sound is. So clear. Easy to use.,1
"Pretty good, but it's 3 star because of two things. First because of the ads, like it's too much, second it's that you make me listen to a song which isn't in my playlist, you don't allow me to skip it, and I'm not allowed to shuffle the playlist again. It's just not great to be forced to listen to a song which I didn't add myself.",0
Just an amazing app overall. Hope you guys are around for generations!,1
It's amazing nothing but 100% just wish te algorithm could determine the next song I would want to listen to based on what I searched better aside from that lovely,0
DEFINITELY AMAZING ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘s UP!!! (Better than MP3ðŸ˜”),1
"I don't know what to say really. This app delivers it all. If you're okay with the cost. I love djay2 integration. That's very nice. Now that it's gone, gotta use tidal. I still like Spotify for streamdeck integration.",1
Music=Spotify even if u don't have premium it is better than most with a vast collection of songs,1
"It's significant for me, I highly recommend him ... But if there are some updates on widgets, It will be more great for me ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©",1
"Can't support a company who supports misinformation. I've been a long time Spotify user, but have found Deezer to be a much better music streaming service. The quality of Spotify is lagging competitors today.",0
Nice and easy to find songs. Nice lay out. Even makes you s playing.,1
"Been having issues lately Wirth the player playing, but not haveing the player UI pop up and not being able to stop it playing. Started about a week 2 weeks ago, on and off, now it's every time I use spotify.",0
I like this app cos it's easy to search musicsðŸ“±ðŸ“±ðŸ“±ðŸ“±ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘!!!,1
"Great variety and compilation of obscure ,widely known,and popular songs.Spotify offers the absolute best selections in music,from traditional,well known bands,to up and coming musical artists.",1
"Is it just me or everyone? Why the hell any song isn't playing beyond 10 sec since I've updated the app, I've even done all the cleaning & blah blah, still doesn't seems to work.",0
"Pretty good ngl I hate the playlists though, absolutely horrible. However this is only on mobile nothing else.",0
Spotify is a very good App it has many languages for songs.... I love the quality of songs and app... Overall I loved the app very much....,1
"Whats wrong with the app nowadays....my bluetooth keeps stopping after listening to 1 song. And pls stop running that scaryy ads..whenever i go for my morning walk 530am or 6...you play that ad..""awaj jo muh se nahi..rooh se aati hai"" death scarry in the morning",0
Overall an awesome source of music and podcasts.,1
Tbh i have a few suggestions to the app But i love how you can watch 3 ads to get 30 minutes free listening i love that Ill update my comment and ill add the suggestions later.,0
I swear to God stop sending me to podcasts everytime I open the app!,0
All songs are available here very easy to use,1
Spotify is the bestâ¤ðŸŽ€ðŸ–¤ðŸ’–ðŸ’•âœŠðŸ¿,1
App will not allow me access to my Premium Family account to invite members. Account is there in the menu but nothing happens when you click on it.,0
Can't listen to a full song in my order without premium it sucks but it all good,1
"I enjoy listening to old school music while cleaning, thanks",1
"Best music app, highly recommend it.",1
"Glitchy. Skips like a CD when you open the app, or any app, or move a couple feet, or really just whenever you're enjoying it. The consistency of this app is really wearing on me. Not the worst money I spend, but definitely not the best... Sometimes ðŸ™„",0
I enjoy the music and they have a wide variety of songs,1
"Always great music, play lists on here",1
"Great listening platform, and with premium (which even gives active students a discount!) Allows me to do anything I could possibly ever want to do with my music and even has tons of music in different languages which lets me listen to some great French music while im learning the language!. Merci beaucoup Spotify!",1
Very good app,1
Hate the fact that I have to get the premium plan just to pick my own music,0
The app has all the original version of the songs,0
I Love these access to music and freedom of selection. Your the best,1
"Brilliant app!!!can you please get proper support and I pressed log out by mistake and it logged me out of a family plan, so pissed, please add a are you sure option if you press log out.",0
without premium still enjoyable,1
I like this app It makes me relax listening to music.,1
I can find any music that i look for this is a really good app I am injoy it .,1
The new order and placement of the playback buttons is so far from any other software that it makes the main player view unusable.,0
Best app for listening to music and podcasts on.,1
"This is a great App â¤no annoying ads in it,easy to use....its just perfect",1
"I absolutely love this app! I've always tried other music apps and they weren't always easy for me to figure out. Spotify is easy to use, has many neat features like adding your favorite playlist to your homescreen. I will keep on using Spotify, it's been there!",1
"The play portion of spotify just disappears on a regular basis. The only way i can get it to return is to shut down the app and restart it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the issue comes back immediately. Recently songs and podcasts also just stop playing. I have to go in and hit play to get them going again. That is if the play section is working. If not, it's restart the app. System stability has been a real issue lately.",0
I swear I hate this app but I like it tho because it is a Amazing app but the twist is why would it need 6 hour skip to skip the music like wth bro?And why cant u play the song in order I swear this update I hate..,0
It Is better online and offline music player,0
"I love Spotify and use it 6+ hours everyday. I have never listened to a single podcast of Joe Rogan but censorship of, no matter who it is, CAN NOT be tolerated. Fascist companies do not get the privilege of me as a customer. I'm canceling my account and deleting from my phone. Shame on you Spotify.",0
I hate the new update. When I play a song it plays a different one also it adds songs on my playlists even if I don't want it. Pls fix this Spotify.,0
"I don't often leave reviews, but the Spotify app is poorly constructed. Playlists that fail to load, screens that lock up requiring the app to be force closed, indications of ""no internet connection"" when one definitely exists, downloaded songs suddenly not being downloaded anymore, and so on. Update: just updated the app, and now I can't listen to my music offline (I'm a paying customer, by the way). So I guess expect a pretty rocky experience with the app.",0
"Need video, and some music are not found, paid for the premium and still can't see some songs,",0
Yeah it's great and all them till you can't find out how to cancel the premium membership I've tried everything I've even looked it up and still I can't find the option to cancel the premium membership this app sucks worser than Pandora I am fixing to uninstall this app,0
"Great service, but the way they have changed the app with the last few updates is terrible. Was so much better a year ago. Updating my review as the app keeps getting worse. Constant crashes, and half the time the play bar at the bottom of the app disappears so you have to hard close the app a few times to get it back again. Also if you switch from a podcast to an album often times the next track will default back to the podcast instead of staying with the album. Covid warnings come in clear.",0
"I listen in my car, on my motorcycle, in my boat and have play lists for each. Great app!",1
Awwsome. Blue tooth connection needs work though.,0
"I don't mind your ads or random insertion of random song, I just wanna listen to songs from a single album, can't even do that unless paying for a premium, useless.",0
App is generally good but occasionally slow and buggy. I also have troubles occasionally with controlling songs playing and playlists when casting to an external device.,0
Truly amazing! Trust me make the playlist from the pc or tablet,1
This is my first podcast experience. It's easy to use. The contents are clear.,1
"Love that you have the ability to scroll through your music Library and information on the websites you peruse all the day long, the#1 reason I'm happy Its discophany simply delivers more than its share for your musical tastes!!!",1
"Keep Stopping, Message ""Go Online"" Keeps interrupting the Play List or With Search Feature. Since APR 2022 Better Review. Upgrade from 2 Star to 5 Star.",0
"Was good now it just doesn't work! Was fine last week then 3 days ago can't access anything on the app. Says no internet connection which is a lie as it's working for anything else. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, logging off and on, restarting phone and still not working. Grrr am going on a long road trip and want to be able to play the Playlist I want. Can't even play recommend Playlist! Might have to cancel subscription!",0
"I used to like the app but the update ruined it. Like now you can't loop the song, you can't pick the song, and if you wanna do all of that you need premium. So be if we could have the old features back it would be perfect.",0
app continues playing a title but the app will not display the track or play/pause/shuffle/repeat features. fix this soon or lose my premium membership.,0
There's ads every 2 songs and it's about a minute or two of ads good sound effects but way to many ads unless you get premium has a good variety of songs as well but if you want to find a specific song it's kind of hard because everything's a Playlist would recommend IF you get premium otherwise you can't really listen to music because it's constantly getting interrupted,0
Can enjoy music while using other apps,1
Very difficult to update payment...everytime i choose my operator it always unable to connect. Very dissapointed,0
"It's unbelievable how often this app crashes, pauses for no reason, or simply refuses to load or play anything, including downloaded songs. The queues often dont function. And I'm skeptical that ""shuffle"" truly is shuffled at all, the same songs always come up. Truly just a trash app. Spotify employees should focus more on doing their job and spend less time complaining about content.",0
"This app is a must but the only thing I don't like it because there's too much of add. After playing one or two music ,there you can hear the sound of the add",0
"Love the variety and ability to make playlists but, it's frustrating that the app randomly stops playing sometimes. Also sometimes the pause button goes away. I have to restart my phone and it usually reverts back to normal.",0
Stop telling me I might like podcasts. They. All. Suck.,0
"Really great music app, I got the premium and it's definitely worth it. I don't find any issues or bugs in this app tbh,,",1
"Can't praise this app enough, It's a way of life, Becomes part of your everyday, anywhere. Works flawlessly, easy to use, works on all (my) devices! Music is a memory, a feeling, this app provides this 100%.",1
The new update doesn't let me play or go back a song I want to play. Deleted,0
My Spotify keeps stopping automatically and its really annoying can someone please look into it!,0
great playlist excellent app,1
"I created playlists but cannot listen to the bhajans I added because Spotify keeps on adding bhajans I have no intrest in and only plays those bhajans they added. I keep deleting the bhajans they add, but they just keep on adding more. I have admitted defeat and deleted 2 playlists.",0
Its easy to get the music of my choice,1
Very buggy on Samsung Galaxy S20. Keeps playing with no way to stop it. Play controls will disappear and/ or become inactive. The only way to fix this is to force stop the app. This is only temporary and issue presents itself at least once a day.,0
Nice product,1
Love the app but sometimes my playlist won't work,0
"Changed to Tidal after losing Joni Mitchell on spotify and it turned out to be a better app anyway, and the audio quality is so much better! From now on I will support apps that focus on music over podcasts ðŸ˜Œ",0
Please don't download this app. It is is an unwelcome cage for most artists and podcasts. It suppresses most of what you want from an audio medium platform with an excessive amount of commercials breaks.,0
Its easy to use and is a good app,1
I am never not using SpotifyðŸ‘ŒðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Phenomenal application that I am overdosing on literally every minute..â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸,0
I can't open the app it says something went i tried many ways but i can't fix it please check it,0
I've had Spotify for many years now & have tried many other music apps but always come back to Spotify.,1
Spotify has prioritized profits over the wellbeing of people by allowing podcasts with large followings to blatantly lie and spew misinformation during a public health crisis. I have deleted my account and uninstalled the app. Would give 0 stars if possible.,0
I love Spotify!!!!! Still loving it!!!ðŸŽ¶,1
This is a very good app but there is so much ads of premium Spotify,0
"All my fav songs, Spotify premium is the best",1
Just love all the great music choices!!!,1
Great service and good Playlist and recommendations,1
Last update ruined playback. Pocast keeps stopping for no reason.,0
Works great. And actually helps me find new artist,1
"Personally I enjoy premium, it's great and I listen to a ton of songs I love on the spot. Kinda wish the song radio choice would be more open instead of mostly songs I've listened to.",0
It can be a good app but the reason I have put 2 is because the reccomended songs are unnecessary when you think people create their own playlist to listen to songs they want not reccomendations,0
"Premium worthless, save the money, your downloaded songs will not play offline, so slow its often unusable, buggy, doesn't work half the time",0
"This app went above and beyond what I was told and everything! Easy as heck to navigate this app and download music, no adds, free and they have everything! I might not go back to YouTube music I like Spotify better!",0
Good music Sound are clear,1
using this app without premium is literally awful. you can't even play a certain song/album that you choose & when you shuffle a playlist it randomly gives you a song/genre that you don't even like. you can skip just 6 times per hour. ad plays after you play 2-3 songs each time. it's always say there's no internet connection meanwhile there is. it even make an artist mix shuffled like what- isn't mix aren't supossed to be shuffled? . this app is literally paytoplay at this point,0
AMAZING,1
My experience is awesome. Easy to use and understand. Great tunes!,1
"This is a wonderful app, but I will put five stars when we have access to the podcast library in Venezuela",1
Albums released here aren't in the correct order of release year; make sure to check a reliable source for release year and track listings. Many tracks are added to albums that aren't actually found on the album but are digital additions.,0
"Honestly Spotify was just fine but now we have to pay to listen to songs of our choice. It just ruined the whole mood now I can't even continue to bear with this because these songs that are chosen, I haven't even heard ðŸ˜¶",0
I took a 3 month trial subscription but I can't seem to be able to use the app at all.. I have gone back to my older app for music after trying to run the app million times. My only concern now is that it says it will charge me after my trial ends and I can't find how to end my subscription. Very unresponsive team haven't had any reply from them on my last review..,0
"this app is currently useless without premium, they removed the feature where u can revview songs when making playlist, now u're forced to put it in your playlist before u can listen to it. very geniusðŸ™„",0
so fine top version of the best of luck with your own home and Garden Inn at the end of this tag only shows image of the best of all time . it is a great day of school and college and the other side of my own personal injury or death and baggage claims to have a great deal of time and money to buy a new phone and email address to receive. This is my word predictor talking .and is the future of uncategorized communication!Tap on a clip to paste it in the text box.,0
The best streaming service imo,1
These are very quick but advertisements come a lot more,0
Too many ads and some covers are not there,0
Since the recent update it's so buggy and annoying. If I stop the music then I have to completely close the whole app to be able to play something again. The mini notification box showing what is playing seems to have lost all function aswell. I use Spotify constantly and even have a premium subscription but I really wish I didn't download the latest update as the app was perfect before and now it's more hassle than it's worth.,0
Hey spotify! How come money by lisa is place with a different song? Fix it ASAP!. zero rate.until you fix it,0
It's not working at all,0
"One of my favorite apps. Music choices are endless, it sounds good, the ads aren't that long, etc. I would definetly recommend this app for studying, roadtrips, homework, and lots more. :)",1
Cannot use microphone to find songs constant loading not easy to find just albums when looking up artists it always gives you a playlist of greatest hits when you just want an album.,1
"Worst app, why are you always doing so much ads, it's really irritating while listening the songs, and it's too much now, is it not enough to you that one time remind every user for subscription? Please stop promoting so much about your premium plans, it's really disappointing me, PLEASE STOP DOING SO MUCH ADVERTISEMENT. OTHERWISE I WILL UNINSTALL YOUR STUPID APP.",0
"Recent update is not good, have to turn off phone to stop music ,not showing current song ,cannot play next song, to skip forward. Please sort out. I pay monthly, but app has gone terrible wrong.",0
Great except for the app only constantly drags you if you don't have money to pay for it,0
Best music and podcast service there is! I have always supported Spotify over all other music platforms because they are the best. Thank you for also allowing freedom of speech.,1
It's good for listening to music.,1
It is great but too many adds,0
It's a great app and totally makes playlist worth ðŸ‘Œ,1
Amazing phenomenon! being born in the sixtys when you qued on a Saturday for vinyl with your pocket money. A lot has happened in a short while! Great value for money.,1
I like how it learns what you like and doesn't overwhelm you with adds. It doesn't limit you on skipping songs either.,1
Best app just please a little lesser adds and some good songs aren't there which isn't good but overall alright,1
Loving it right now.... Need help with can we download songs to watch offline?,1
"Not user friendly, should let one focus on only music. I don't want podcasts, especially not right wing anti vaxx nutcase podcasts",0
Excellent,1
Poor application experience. Spotify is what will someday be a dark remnant of this bloated infrastructure without Innovation that sprung up in the wake of our collective desire to share and listen to music. Think Ipod. Think myspace. I hate Spotify This review is critical for exactly the right reasons; Spotify lost touch with the individual in 2012 when profits soared. Look elsewhere and consider options to actually own your own copies of music.,0
"""Hey, instead of skipping how about you edit your playlist"" YOU ADDED IT NOT ME. Anyways, this would be a 5 star if it wasn't on mobile. Why can't they just be the same? I understand there are other platforms that can prevent it, but really? It's just annoying that there are only 6 skips an hour, and you add songs to my playlist without my permission. I'm ranting again...",0
This app would be good if not for it taking over any device it is on. I start comp. There's Spotify starting up. I start phone same problem. I know I could change it and problem solved but that is just one example of little annoying little insertions into my daily life. There's also the fact if I start it on android there is no quick way to stop the app. And even when I do stop it there is still the notification to continue listening I want to. That is not helpful it is annoying and needy,0
Very well composed allow at least 10 downloads.,1
"I loved spotify, but the most recent update makes it where I can't pick what song is playing, and it just plays randomly and never plays music on my playlist anymore, if this is the new Spotify, I will be deleting Spotify and use something else, now I also can't see what is even on my playlist anymore, it just has a list and not a playlist",0
Love the app and all the content that comes with it!,1
Amazing no problems at all with spotify,1
Great music and you can't beat the price.,1
"it's a nice app but recently im unable to preview songs when i go to the ""add songs"" section. i can only preview them when they're already in a playlist. also, the 6 skips an hour thing is unnecessary, rlly no need for that lol",0
Best but too ads,0
Pls make group session can joinable from discord.. not link.. like. Idk. But like desktop,0
Donâ€™t download this app this app is trying is best to make it hard to listen songs. Hate suffle ðŸ¤¬ Just try mod apk its great or buy premium donâ€™t be a foolðŸ˜˜,0
Update and always gives me my requested song,1
Can't change video speed. Screen fades then it crashes,0
"Used for years across many devices; only 4* as on current device it sometimes won't let me pause or skip without restarting, however, this may be an issue with the device.",0
"Seek, play,pause,etc. buttons completely missing from the latest update. Very poor update. Please bring back the old interface.",0
It is so much better than SoundCloud. I just wish the 3rd party DJ controller functions were back.,1
LOVE,1
Googd app Advertisments tloud.... Much too loud Speaker volume to 50% but advertisments are 80%-90% or louder Too bad,0
"The app has been fine for me ever since I downloaded it (probably 2 years ago), but since 2 days ago it hasn't been working for me at all. Only opens with the logo showing up in the middle of a black screen, then never responding after. Tried all the things I could in reddit and guides online, same result. Uninstalled multiple times and reinstalled only to be met with the same exact result. Tried deleting cache and data, still the same thing. Hope my app gets fixed :(",0
"Great music, but difficult to access help when trying to change plan.",0
Recent update broke the current playing song bar both in-app & in notifications,0
Not working. Will give more stars when fixed,0
I saw this advert telling I can use it to watch live football game after download I can't see anywhere to watch ball ðŸ€ðŸ€ just music ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ,0
Back-to-back no commercials not YouTube and not nothing better than this,0
It doesn't really play some of the songs I want it to sometimes,0
Really good app to listen online music,1
Too good!! But I got same problem like everyone else that is-adds! Is it really necessary to give adds after 2-3 songs??? It really is the only bad experience but reat is good to go,1
Entertainment app and can listen any language song,1
I pay for Spotify premium and still get ads on podcasts.,0
"Spotify needs to add a way to selectively move more songs at once from one playlist to another. And we need more pins for playlists, 4 aren't enough",0
Very nice sound quality is amazing,1
Only a Nazi would make an app like this. You have no control over song selection. Oh and you can only skip 6 songs an hour. So this is how freedom dies.,0
My Spotify was before working properly but idk wht juz happened it's isn't opening...please do something,0
"I've had to uninstall and reinstall this app twice because there's no support team, just a troubleshooting page, so when the app seriously messes up there's literally nothing else I can do. I'm about to start looking into other music playing apps because there's no way im paying for a subscription to something this buggy.",0
The advertising is more and more,0
Spotify is labeling songs with nothing bad in them as explicit and leaving several songs with actual explicit lyrics unlabeled. ???,0
"No internet connection. I have paid membership of Spotify but since I am using this app, facing same issue again and again that is when I have internet connection on or connected with wifi and connection is live and running on full speed,Spotify app shows 'no internet connection'. I even contacted with Spotify team and I told about problem they assured me to solve the problem but issue remains unresolved.",0
Since 2/5/22 update no sound on music or audio only podcasts. Joe Rogan video podcast does have sound.Have an invidia shield on a Sony smart TV.,0
Best music quality of all music apps.Even all new and old songs are present on Spotify. And provides you playlists of your own choice.,1
Best song app ever,1
Way more fun to add music and experience different artists when the algorithm matches genres!!! Apple could never lol,1
"Best overall music app, very easy to access everything, and has an impressive collection of artists and songs. Also, being a premium subscriber, the offline mode is definitely worth it, the whole subscription gives you an amazing selection of features barely comparable to any other platform.",1
"Great concept but it will now just stop playing after a few songs, I can't see what song is playing or pause or skip it in the app without doing a hard reset. Please fix these bugs so my favourite app can get back to being useful ðŸ™if it isn't fixed soon, I'll probably switch streaming service ðŸ˜­",0
It assumes I like to listen to the same type of music all of the time,0
"You get access to a lot of music and the general interface is very easy to use use. Main issue is that some songs you might find on YouTube just aren't on Spotify, especially covers of songs. There's also no obvious way to select a not interested option for podcasts and Spotify will constantly spam you with the same ones you do not want.",0
"Was great! But 3-4 ads of 30 seconds each consecutively??? So, uninstalled. Agreed it's free, but can't wait for 2 mins to hear a song. Sorry.",0
Dude is suck update is disappointing why can't play full song not short replay,0
I wish there was a feature to delete songs from a custom created playlist by swiping left or right. It's very inconvenient when u want to delete a couple songs every other day and need to make few steps to make it happen. One swipe would be so much better. But in general i love the app,1
"There's no way a can stop a playing music, I don't know what you did with the player controls, it's so frustrating!!!",0
Would be great but the 5 30 second ads kinda ruin it,0
Spotify is good.,1
Please add download feature for songs. I would give it 5 stars if it had download feature,1
Awesome,1
Skipping with screen locked in Android 12!! This is the 3rd time Spotify has been unable to keep up with Android updates. Please patch! I love this app and I hate when this happens!,1
The dreaded 2 star review! Has been awesome but has the recent update broken UI/song being played. No display of the song I'm playing? Have to close the app !?! (premium a/c),0
I want to replay the songs I want to hear but another song comes up and you can't even go back to the song I hate this app,0
I love spotify with how much songs there have and even new artists i like it where u can listen to a song while doing something on a another appp,1
Changed my music experience... positively,1
Constantly need to restart the app to show the now playing bar at the bottom.,0
Lyrics aren't available for any of the songs (latest updated),0
Videos don't play only audio on podcast when connected to radio....if they drop rogan I'm out....only reason I got spotify was rogan,0
I can do the work but listen to it,1
Downgrade to 2 stars due to the recent bugs. Now playing bar disappears. Music keep stopping from time to time.,0
"Podcast upload time beats I Heart but it keeps turning off seemless play and pausing for every text, when you are working it is the worst",0
"Had some problems with iPhone, back to Android ok",0
Spotify is fantastic. Getting Joe Rogan's podcast was a huge win. Thanks for not censoring him+,1
"The best online Music app ever !! The quality of music, collection of songs, non-premium service quality & value-for-money premium plans... There's no match to Spotify !! Note: This review after 1 year of non-premium usage, 1 month of premium usage of Spotify & using umpteen number of other premium & non-premium online Music apps including prime music for the last 1 year.",0
The fact that the sometimes you can't end group session and needing to reinstall it every time is cancer. Because of that sometimes the reinstalled app can't open. You can't even do a damn group session on the desktop like bro it's 2022 how badly advance do you want it to be.,0
"The app randomly logs me out from time to time, which is very annoying when you're on a long trip without internet. It also sometimes randomly removes downloaded music (sometimes all of it), even though I've got plenty space left. Listening offline doesn't work great in general. Even when you've downloaded something, it'll sometimes say ""no internet connection"" when you click on the album. Not being able to see the length of songs in the queue and the length of the queue in general is annoying.",0
Premium Subscription All Plan Cost to High Compared to Ganna so that's reason I'm Not Use Spotify ðŸ–•,0
"Offers free music of all kinds. Really an awesome app to listen to music anytime, anywhere. I have this music app for three years now and it's one of the best-if not the best!",1
This is the best music app,1
"Suddenly I was logout without my intention or knowing, and all my songs 770+ are gone",0
"Absolutely insulting and awful. You can't even listen to a song from a particular album, it just plays a random song from any old album by the artist. It's terrible. I thought Adele had spoken to Spotify and fixed this, it's a insult to artists and fans and shows no respect at all towards music as a art form. Shame on you Spotify. What a disgrace",0
You deserve a five star ,1
Good sound selection service,1
Earth makes an awesome variety of musical offerings and Spotify does a great job of finding new music to suit my taste and cravings.,1
I like it but Spotify you gotta stop with the ads like I was trying to listen to music and there were add but 3 of them to just listen to one song like stop with the ads there's way to much,0
It is a good app but I can't lisin with it when I don't have my itrnet off...,1
This app na real scam... You learn to walk before you run... Get sense for apps like Bumplay na be everything be money most times on mobile alow us plays songs of our choice even when we never sub haba! I search song finish after playing it i couldnt play it again its unfair na na scam spirit be that... Abeg after this review i dy uninstall this rubbish app from my phone.... If na be say i gat post i fo no give una shipian star like this....,0
"I get 4-5 ads everytime. 1-2 is ok to handle. But in the gap of 15-20 min, handling 4-5 times same thing really sucks... Having said that, the quality of music is wonderful.",1
Songs will stop mid way through randomly.nevet used to have this problem,0
Can you please add a feature where you can move songs aka change the order,1
downloaded playlist won't play off-line in my premium account.,0
It was good a long time ago. Now it plays 5 adds every 2 songs and I'm not over exaggerating. I'd go with SoundCloud or YouTube music instead...,1
I love listening to my favourite songs in spotify,1
"Sound quality is good but not as strong as Tidal, main quality it has going for it is shear name recognition and getting the diamonds in the rough uploaded that might not be on other platforms (artists, wink wink) Has no block features for songs you don't like that keep showing up, and it's prediction algorithm keeps suggesting the same stuff. I find one new song I like maybe once a month if I'm lucky",0
"Love it! It kills Pandora, especially finding songs you might like, always gives me a Playlist I love, and I always find new songs on there i haven't heard anywhere else.. The ads are redundant but when I pay for membership it is well worth it. Spotify gets 5 stars â­â­â­â­â­",1
"I use Spotify A LOT! On my earbuds, in my car, through my TV... I've made playlists so I can hear what I want, and I listen to podcasts. This is a great app! When I'm trying to destress I listen to music and it's easy to find what I want to hear on Spotify.",1
Used this since 2017 and it gets used every single day Live the podcasts and the ability to just go anywhere Premium is deffinetly worth the price based on useage,1
New update makes Android audio work only about half the time. Also most of the time I need to restart the app to get the now playing showing on Android. Extremely frustrating.,0
Always been a good music provider ive had them over 5 years,1
Best of the best of bestest. Don't be cheap and get premium.,1
Great music but theres some bugs,0
Absolutely ultimate music customized just for you. 15 year member,1
Very useful AAP,1
It's great to see my good friend Joshua Eli Smith getting his music out there. He's going to go far. I enjoy hearing new artist that will be on the radio and the awards shows in the future.,1
Clear and good audio to listen and to enjoy ðŸ˜‰,1
"Bad. It was fine a few weeks ago but after the updates I can't choose the song I want to listen and I can't replay the song I want unless I get premium. It also skips many songs then move to another song. For example, the song I'm listening to is ""Double take"" and the next song is ""Wellerman"" then after ""Double takes"" ended it skips Wellerman"". I'm also having a lot of trouble finding the song I want to listen. I want the old Spotify back. I hate it now, it's a complete MESS after the update!",0
Very nice  ,1
Playlists are being rearranged at the speed of light- this is clearly a bug and reinstalling did not work to fix it,0
I hate ðŸ˜¤ it I dont like adss Har 2 gaano ke baad ye chand baliyaaa krte hye ads aa rhe h Plz stops these ads,0
"Visible player keeps vanishing which means you can't pause, forward, rewind, set a timer etc. Sometimes comes back when phone restarted. Used to work fine, horrible lately.",0
I've been using this app for years but recently Somethings up with the app please fix it. Sometimes the music just starts playing but there is no way to stop it. I can't get the album cover of song I'm listening up. There has been other issues are a recent thing. Please fix it,0
I dislike how shuffling the playlist always resumes the last played song that was shuffled instead of shuffling the playlist entirely,0
I've been listening for years and still is the absolute best out there best around and most outstanding of them all hands down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘,1
Very nice  app,1
Love the music options,1
I like it with no commercial,0
Does what it's supposed to. Easy to navigate ... Easy to use.,1
I have had this app for about 8 years now I love it I love I can download my music for when I don't have data I can still listen to my stuff â¤ï¸,1
"the phone app sucks without premium but if you have enough money for it and you love music I'd definitely go for premium. The sound quality is so pleasant, the fact you can save the music is very convenient and the skips are nice to have. Plus the adds were getting unbearable!",1
Great app,1
"Been a subscriber for years, I love it. Appreciate all the specific playlist curating they do for you specifically. I also really appreciate the privating of playlists, not everyone needs to know what songs I cry to on the reg.",1
Great way to get podcasts and music.,1
Cool app,1
Love Spotify!! Enough said...,1
It's Soo smooth and the best of all 82 million songs and 4 billion playlist,1
I didn't used it for months ... And now when I'm opening it it is not displaying any song or anything.... And when I'm searching for any song it's showing i have no internet connection ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸,0
"If you don't pay for premium you get the same 5 ads every 15 minutes, if you do pay for premium you're contributing to Joe Rogan.... lose/ lose",0
Stop with the drive notification. It goes off at complete random.,0
"the ""we added"" feature thing is useless every single time you make a playlist with one song they just add more so you get less ""bored"" or stuff idk bruh this app is good but I wouldn't recommend making your own playlist",0
"After more then a month after spotify upgrades app doesnt work anymore. Total amateur hour, these guys are a disgrace for the it profession and should be fired, beyond ridiculous!!!!",0
"This app has been lagging a lot over the las months. The screen freezes during playback and sometimes it doesn't even show the ""now playing"" screen preview at the bottom. It also has terrible delay when playing on Bluetooth mode. Please fix this!",0
Experience is good but I am not getting any songs lyrics I hope you work on that problem and you will fix that THANK YOU,1
Very nice means for your favourite songs.,1
"It's a great app. My issue is sometimes I'll get 10 or so ads back to back, all ranging from 10-30 seconds. I understand artists need paid. Ads are fine. But 10 ads in a row, multiple times is honestly kinda ridiculous. I did some research that said there's about 2-3 minutes of ads in an hour of music, which is more then reasonable. But I just sat through 5 minutes straight of them. Everything else is great. But the excessive ads might be growing into a deal breaker.",0
"Good, but their is very ads I think if Spotify remove some ads it was extremely good",1
I love this app because there is lot of songs I like.,1
I used to love Spotify soo much back in 2018 but from this past 3 year's I'm having problem whenever I play a song dudee 3/4 ads will play I'm soo sick with this app now cos of ads (: not all peoples can afford subscription so sorry unstalling \:,0
Terrible. They said you can download music but there's no option to do it. I saved songs to my drive and all it copied was text. I'm going to get rid of the app.,0
The music choices are vast and quality is awesome,1
"Had Spotify for years, but now for the last few days, the app is basically useless. Music just cuts out intermittently, or just stops completely. Can't skip songs or pause either. I have to close the app completely to stop music playing. Please sort it out!",0
Very enjoyable! Sorry I did not know about it sooner. It has made a big difference to someone like me who loves music and can readily have my favourite music available. Thanks spotify!,1
Awesome,1
Ive been listening to Spotify for a number of years now and this app never fails me i love finding new artists that are relevant to the ones I currently listen to And I can probably say 90 of my time is listening to music ,1
This app is amazing... Can get any song you can think of... And best experience too.,1
Great sound quality and easy to find music,1
Enjoy the largest collection of music with excellent quality and inbuilt adjustments of the app,1
Do you want to listen to songs then download Spotify are you going to do is put your school email and or your parents email in but if your kid like I am do not do it just put your school email and you can listen to whatever song you want Spotify I love it be sure when you download it to read it five stars ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,1
"Still waiting for an ""add to playlist"" button on the player rather than being hidden in a menu. Difficult to organize songs because of this.",0
"Every single update manages to somehow break something that is essential to the functioning of the app. I have been using Spotify for years, and the app has NEVER not been broken.",1
It just a good app in general but there are too many premium restrictions,0
"Vast selection of music, but supports misleading information.",0
"Very impressive app, but, please help us download some music so we can play it offline.",1
Great customer support. My app wasnt functioning at all after an update & I was very dissapointed. After a couple of emails it was solved. Seems to have been a glitch with my SD card & now its working again & my sanity has returned. After 10 years of using spotify this is the only problem i have had & it has been resolved swiftly. Thank you!,0
"the non-premium experience is horrible to the point of that it should not even exist. If you dont want to spend money on listening to music then literally use any other platform and steer clear from this. You should not support this business practice. If you dont enjoy using the service please uninstall the app, it really goes a long way to hurt the company",0
Good to get your music heard,1
Best music app by far,1
It's great to be able to listen to my favourites.,1
This is really good but i try to listen to rain sounds while i sleep then a few minutes later it turns off,0
"Yk I've got one question. Why is using Spotify on the website more ""free"" than in app- like, you literally need to pay premium in the app for the things you already get in the website??",0
"Not Spotify,it should be named addify. It's really disgusting to watch addvertisement after every 2-3 songs!!",0
I love Spotify and how easy to use it is. And the best part is no commercials. I'm a big fan. Thanks for the great music! ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¼ðŸ˜€,1
"Playlists stop part way through and app shows nothing to play. Hiding any track from a playlist means nothing, will still play it. And that's if by some miracle it links to a speaker and plays for more than 10 seconds at a time. Often go back onto the app to find the now plating section has gone meaning you can't get back to the same track/ place in the track you paused on",0
Superb app very easy to use i really enjoy using thank you Spotify,1
This aap is amazing but I can't see the lyrics of the songs even after becoming a premium member.So please solve this problem.,0
I love Spotify there are no ads if you subscribe which is worth every penny and there are hundreds of thousands of songs and podcasts to listen to and if you have children who like music there is a restricted setting. So 5 stars â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸ and 5 hearts â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤ for you Spotify.,1
I love the app but having a Playlist that is 3 hours long and only having it play the same 10 songs repeatedly is quit annoying.,0
Great app but i'd really like if there was an option to play songs that isn't on your playlist,0
"great application with a lot of different music, everyone will find something for themselves",1
Best AI always comes up with a song I have never heard but like Spotify know me better then I do!!,1
Cannot live without my spotify,0
Can only shuffle on phone,0
"Couldnt get any worse... Its been days the app has been showing No network connection. Only the previously played songs would play again. Cant search for songs nor play different ones. Once You uninstall, then you can no longer log in. Amazing job guys. Keep it up.",0
They beg but good,1
What is wrong with this app whenever I feel like I wanna listen something and I open it won't open...it always a black screen.And sometimes tell me to sign up againðŸ¤¨,0
"Helpful enough for me on enjoying my idols' musics, but there some kind of error I've been getting on lately, the 'no connection available' problem whenever I uses my data is such a problem to me, by the way I'm an android user. I don't know if it's my phone or indeed the spotify itself, but please do fix it asap, it struggles me so much.",0
"Shuffle isn't a true shuffle, it plays what it thinks you want to hear with no option to change it. I use this for a public facility and it plays the same song multiple times in a span of an hour.",0
Worst app .. With 10 minutes music and lots of ads,0
I loved thia app I used it all the time to listen to music but you have to buy preimum to listen better. The thing is you also have to pay I would recommend this but when you listennto songs it gives you so many adds and not even the song you would like to listen,0
"Fix your downloads and make it more user friendly. Give me the ability to remove multiple downloads. When I click download it takes forever to load, the app become glitchy.",0
Amazing so many songs and all from your favdourite artists!,1
"EN: It's a good app; However,audio quality is low for my liking, only 320kbit/s; It would be great if you would partner with Dolby Laboratories, Inc. Or DTS Inc.â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢SPA: Es una buena aplicaciÃ³n; Sin embargo, La calidad de audio es baja para mi gusto, solamente 320kbit/s; serÃ­a Genial si ustedes se asociaciarÃ¡n con Dolby Laboratories, Inc. O DTS Inc.",0
I don't like that we need premium just to listen to the whole song and when I play my song it played random instead please let us play the songs what we want to play without premium let premium allow you to play music offline and have no ads if you did this update it would be better,0
"Going to start actively start going and down voting the pages of the pop up ads. ""Spotiflyer"" app may be the next course.",0
Crashing way too much. Brought it to the support teams attention awhile ago. It's only been getting worse. Still getting worse,0
Loving the endless access to the music the options to enhance it is always a bonus to have access to what can inspire is'nt that what music is for? That's a good thing yeah? It's where we want to go yeah? Loving it.,1
It is honestly one of the best.. The only problem is that it doesn't work with mobile data. It works just fine with wifi. And I've tried everything but still the same...,1
Never any problems,1
Very amazing and wonderful app. Very easy to use. I have never had any issues with it. This is still the best music streaming app.,1
Had all the songs I ask for and also recommended other artists from the genre great app.,1
Very good apps with vast collections of all type of songs and prodcasts. It's unique way of creating with ease of accessing personal album is just superb!,1
It's an amazing app for music lovers like me. ads became less than before UI is also good but music recommendation is not satisfying. That's why I rated only 4 star.,0
Love the different types of music and podcasts.,1
"Lots of music, yes. If you listen to one genre the same songs and or Playlists come up often, lacks that diversity.",0
The app is great but the update is not good when I try to play my fav song a totally different song play that I never heard and I can't restart the song I like I like the app when it dint update,0
"I love this app, all my music in one place. I can make Playlist of my favorites and listen any time.",1
Very good music excellent to listen to . A fantastic variety of music to choose from,1
"I enjoy listening to music I found through shazaam and saving it to my Spotify. Listening to my playlist keeps me sane, and the autoplay similar style really helps keep whatever mood I need/want going. Loving it.",1
It is good i like this app i love listening to music and I loved it,1
A much better sound and the off chance you must have a go ar the equalizer you'll dig other features that include being able to surf the web or do other options I will find better music apps on when I try but this one is easy to find and easy to use and easy to install it's good for CV camp Verde,0
"It could be better, it could be worse. I haven't used premium service; 1. Because I don't want to pay for something I downloaded for free only to use my Bose speaker. 2. I haven't been able to get just what I look for and what i do find has a bunch of other stuff with it that is REALLY random. Maybe I am just too use to YouTube and how it is designed. I hope with updates my mind will change.",0
Favorite music app ..hands down,0
Unlimited access to music is fire as hell. Love it soooo much.,1
Every tym I listen music I feel relaxed..Spotify is really good ðŸ‘,1
"Cant even play the song i wanna play... In a Music Streaming app, I cant play a song i want",0
"I should NOT have to shut off my data and wifi just for my playlist to load up quicker. It's downloaded and saved to my phone, so why does it take forever to load up when connected to internet and mobile data.",0
"Worst application i had never seen... In my 5G mobile.. it can handle like 0% speed. When i pause one song, it will respond after 1 min.. really worst thing.. This application response is very very worst slow performance. Update or remove the aap from all playstores. Tq",0
"Very disappointed with the app. Too many bugs. Using a Galaxy S21 Ultra with up-to-date firmware and Spotify app, have to close the app completely to stop play. Can't go back or move forward on the file being played either. Rubbish.",0
If I act really cute and go  will you bring back the hearts  Pretty please ,1
"I don't like the mobile features, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT SHUFFLE! but the music access is nice. I give it 3 stars",1
"Very nice,mind clearing,very easy to operate, fantastic music and amazing app",1
"For the past few years it was working fine, but eversince the update there's been a problem. And I'm 99.9% sure its because i have an android because it works fine on my laptop and still works for my brother who has an iphone. This shouldn't be the case especially because i pay for premium. I'm contemplating whether i should just deleting the app and moving to a different streaming service ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¾ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¾ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¾",0
Best songs quality and very easy to use . ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,1
"Am really enjoying myself with the app, is really a moving truck",1
Spotify Premium is worth the money,1
"Too many ads. Just ridiculous. One ad= one song, again one ad= one song",0
Thanks for this app we can slecet artist in Spotify and very good quality of sound Thanks,1
The incessant prompt to join another person's session makes me want to drop spotify completely,0
"Love the app, but I have a small question. When I look for widgets, you have two-one green, one red. Doesn't matter which one I choose, I always get the original (green) widget. Any reason for this? Not a problem, just curiosity.",0
"After 2 or 3 songs, it will suddenly stop playing!",0
"4/10/2022 : The latest update has minorly affected the functionality of the app. My Now Playing (NP) sometimes disappears from the UI's bottom, simultaneously disappearing from persistent notifications. App must be restarted (force stop + reopen) to regain those elements. With a premium account it's otherwise fine, though I do frequently feel ashamed for supporting its executives. Despite their bosses, the devs continue to put out a quality app.",0
"It's a 5 star app for me. My biggest issue is since 5/13/2022 I cannot play music, search music nor do I have access to my playlists and albums. If you remove your SD card, Uninstall the app, restart phone and reinstall and reinsert SD card the app will work. For me I cannot download my music to my SD card or attempt too or the issues will come back.",0
It's amazing. One thing is needed that those who haven't get premium they can't download music at least five can download without premium. But over in all i like Spotify.,1
"I really love Spotify a lot. Like most apps though, you have a limit for songs you can skip. I love how small artists can post there music and content, and its really cool when you can send friends your playlist.",1
"I love spotify. Rating one star so they hopefully see errors. Music starting and stopping. Same issue across multiple devices connected to multiple networks in an effort to diagnose. Restart app. Clear cache. Uninstall clear cache. Nothing. Galaxy 21, Galaxy s21 ultra, Galaxy S9. Player drawer disappearing, must force stop app to stop music when music is playing.",0
Best music app and best podcast app too !!,1
The play button is now on the left side of the screen instead of the centre like every other music player in existence and there is no way to change it back.,0
I have liked song that I play then all of the sudden in the middle of my playlist some other music comes up that I don't like at all then you try to skip bit then there is like 10 of those songs.This is not good service Spotify.,0
One of my Favourite App ever coz I used ganaa and Saavn but nothing can give the satisfaction coz the ad experience was very bad Now I used the Spotify and its very good now Thank you Spotify ,1
Good tunes and it free,1
"I just spent a 2-hour drive in silence, because the Spotify app doesn't work at all without an internet connection, even if you're exclusively using offline features (like playing albums already downloaded specifically for offline use).",0
"If other platforms can cut down on vaccine misinformation, I don't see why Spotify can't either.",0
"It would be nice if you could turn off autoplay for podcasts. It keeps adding previously listened to podcasts to the queue. I don't want a queue of podcasts; I just want to listen to the one I selected. I'm constantly removing previously listened to episodes from the queue, and they keep automatically being readded to the queue. Super annoying. Also, it won't bring up downloaded episodes when I'm not connected to wifi.",0
Pretty often it freezes on a single song and I can't skip or choose the previous song.,1
Spotify is a great music app,1
I enjoy the selection of music and podcasts. I do wish how I pick my podcasts download for the day would go in the order like Amazon let me. Otherwise I'm enjoying Spotify!,1
Nice,1
"Always starts with 'no internet connection' after loading, swiping to add to queue feature always disabled for some reason. Why am I paying for this app again???",0
Something going on with the app. Used to work great but now the player display has gone so can't pause and have to restart my phone to stop palying. Would be great if Spotify could rectify.,0
"Been a great experience, highly recommend.",1
"Bad to worse. Playing offline had been hit or miss. Now, downloaded song are just not available offline. So if you live and work inside buildings, you won't have your music. Been a premium customer for years. Dropping it now. There's no point in paying for a useless app.",0
Its a very good music app but the one thing I dont like is how we have to pay for us to pick any song in any order and i dont know if its just me but i cant put any song on loop but its a good app,1
"Fix your app, i have been using spotify since 2014 and now since 2021 i have issues with spotify mobile, the downloads automatically delete themself when you turn off or restart your phone, the recommendations of a playlist are broken since you reach 500 songs in one playlist and now my session get randomly closed when i close the app.",0
It's a good app but could use some improvement.,0
Great services with music all around Good features Try restrictions in data plz Never heard songs with ads after every 2 songs! Change this plz! Earlier it was more songs and less adds This is horrible!,0
i love spotify despite the few issues,1
Perfect app for listening to songs,1
I like how you can play music with your phone off unlike YouTube music you need premium to do it.,1
Cancelling my premium subscription and uninstalling the app because Spotify supports the spread of dangerous misinformation about COVID-19 via Joe Rogan's podcast. They have a lot of power and are using it in a way I cannot enable.,0
Used application for a while now rid of commercials because I didn't like them it is Handy to have because I listen to a bunch of music â˜ºï¸ thank you for the great music,0
"As always great app, what would we do without Spotify.",1
"It was really great, but now it's became a dumpster fire. The internet automatically says there's no connection, no matter what internet I use. (which I know I have internet or I wouldn't be writing this.) All of my downloads keep undownloading themselves, and now with it saying no internet I can't use Spotify anymore. It was great a month or two ago but now it's horrible!!!",0
Been trying to login for ages- installed- uninstalled- restarted- its just driving me mental- i cant even get past the logim page anymore-,0
I tried many times but can't get it,0
Good for school. It gives u premim for a month for free but I don't like how it won't even let skip songs without premium.,1
"The app is wonderful, but recently it's terrible. Since i updated the app it's going very bad, the app stops, doesn't load, sometimes the downloaded songs disappear from my phone and it's too slow to launch the app. All this is due to poor optimization of the app or the Spotify server, I'm not pretty sure about what is the problem, but it's not my phone or internet, and it happens in all my friends's android devices, not iOS nor Windows. Thanks.",0
Its real easy to hear a favourite song i like it,1
Wouldn't hurt to have Shazam like capabilities to listen and save music on the fly.,1
app works much better on iPhone! when you turn the screen off the playback starts stuttering. getting worse with each update.,0
I love this app!!! It is fantastic!ðŸ’¯,1
The ads are irritating and drain my mobile data.,0
Best app subscription for music,0
"Thanks for this app, i was happy to discovered many new underrated good song complete with the lyrics, but sometimes I found the lyrics failed to load or just.. gone. It's always happen to unknown/small artist's song. I wonder if you could fix that?",0
"The BEST music streaming service EVER!!! I use it every single day, and don't know what I'd do without Spotify.",1
The mobile app sucks compared to the desktop app. Both are free but why is the mobile app so much worse with so many more ads?,0
Love this,1
I'm not able to cancel my monthly subscription. No option found on the app. Article provided isn't helpful.,0
"Ads after every song? Not to mention the ads are priority as they don't take time to load off my CELL DATA, yet the song buffers here and there as loading it's data isn't priority over and data. Oh also nice false advertising, ""get 30 minutes and free after listening to these ads"" I measure the time, and it gets shorter each time, first time it was 27 minutes before an ad, then 22, eventually I measured it lower but can't remember. Good job Spotify, you're throwing yourself away.",0
"I got Spotify Premium a few months ago. At the Beginning, everything was fine. A few crashes here and there. Now not even the currently played song is correct - like: how. Moreover buttons partially need minutes to react. Spotify tells me over and over again I got no connection, though everything else Internet related works just fine. The SD Card implementation just works for a part. The app is laggy, crashes and basic functions stop working over time. Please start working on performance & fixes",0
"Spotify has everything I like to listen to and more. Create your own playlists, mix and match music to satisfy your mood. My #1 go to when I hit the highways and just wanna hear it all.",1
Cant skip music after latest update. The new UI is not functional. Do you even test new versions on existing devices? Can't even shuffle or unshuffle the player anymore. The latest update destroyed it.. and no im not using some unsupported android device. Im on the newest Samsung tablet,0
Exellent,1
"Got hit by the reset and delete bug that Spotify refuses to admit exists. Woke up this morning without music because I had to log in to Spotify, breaking my Google assistant morning routine. Would discover shortly after leaving later that day that ALL of my downloaded music for offline listening had been deleted along with all my settings. I have a premium account, a paid account with Spotify and this is what happened. Not the first, won't be the last.",0
"The app keeps stopping playing the track randomly, saying that there's no Internet connection. I did not experience this before the latest update. PLEASE FIX IT NOW!",0
"Why, oh why must Spotify ask me about bloody Bluetooth every freaking time I open the goddamn app? It makes no difference if I answer yes or no.",0
"ThrillingðŸ’¯, but previously played songs on a playlist can't be played back.... I don't know why",0
"Good app with a great algorithm, when it actually works.... I get constant 'No internet connection' messages, whether on WiFi or 4/5g and all other apps work...",1
"Good quality audio files ! To give you all round experience of music , selection of music is quite decent , but some genres needs more content!",0
The app is great but I can't listen to specific songs that I want to hear I always get a different song and it's always shuffled and I'm getting frustrated about the fact that I can't listen to them,0
"LOVE LOVE ACTUALLY AM OBSESSED WITH THIS APP. As a musician myself, I need good music to get me through my day and spotify does exactly that. The only thing that would make this a full five stars is if they could bring the canvas art back. Deeply appreciate the inside look we can get for each song. It used to be there but now it's gone from my android ðŸ’”",0
Lots of ads and can't pick/skip to the song that we want,1
I have started having the same issues as others. Play bar disappears. When I shut off my car it starts playing on my phone. In order to stop it from playing I have to kill the app in settings. Are you working on a fix?,0
Love this app,1
Your App is addictive. It has a unique way of compiling music of same genre by different artist in one place. Great indeed.,1
you money grabbers want me to pay for premium just to stop my Playlist from shuffling? I can even play a specific song without it switching to a different one.,0
"The music quality, the lyrics, and podcasts are the best. I think the paid version is worthed. But I'm not sure why every time you open the app, always says ""there is not connection"", and you have to wait like 1 minute. The others apps I have in my phone works perfect with cellular data.",0
"I enjoy the fact that I can enjoy good music for free,Just a few commercials,It is worth it.I'm an occasional listener.Thanks.",1
I can't imagine my live without Spotify. Great app,0
Wonderful,1
Absolute nightmare for me it plays the wrong music all the time,0
App keeps stopping at random even when using offline and downloading content. Pretty annoyed with that issue. It won't even show what is playing so when i want to pause i leteraly have to shut dowb the app.,0
Crashes all the time!,0
"There are so many relentless ads, too many considering how little they pay their artists. It will say that I have ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" and then play 4 more ads (no exaggeration.) It's tiring and annoying.",0
"Having issues with the media player disappearing every now and again, usually after connecting to a device via Bluetooth. Once disconnected it carries on playback through the phone speaker, but with no media player showing it can't be paused or stopped. Apart from that, happy with the service.",0
I don't get my thirty minutes when they say it And too much ads,0
The best music streaming,1
"Spotify needs to make it easier to delete duplicates in playlists. But love their enhancement option for playlist. Spotify, when are you gonna create a dj mixing capability for playlists? It would be game changing. . . ;)",0
"Zero stability and reliability. Will not show the now playing, music has been stopping randomly and has issues resuming. When you accidentally swipe to the next podcast in queue, you lose the podcast you were listening to.",0
I think its a good app i just wish i could chose the song i play,1
Best app for music lovers but there are many errors in spelling of lyrics,0
Ads on this app have gotten so bad. I get four ads every three songs. You would probably get less ads listening to music on YouTube,0
No issues. Love Spotify,1
Very good for listening to music very easily thank you,1
I literally use it like every second of every day of my life I absolutely love it sm and it's even better with premium ðŸ˜©,1
Best app,1
"spotify was the best music app for me but now it won't let me listen to my playlists in order, shuffles every song, and won't even let me search for just a song, it comes in a playlist. I don't know what's up with Spotify but clearly I can see it doesn't want me to enjoy music",0
HI team spotify!!!!! Whats going on with the update? It is so confusing? Can you stop? We were fine with your previous update!,0
"The app has been full of bugs the last 4months. Continuous unstable connections when reception and data is in abundance, songs freezing, playlists not loading (both downloaded and streaming). Very frustrating when paying for a premium service.",0
"Autoplay is frustrating. I hate when I connect to any of my Bluetooth devices, Spotify immediately starts playing. I'll pick what I want to play on my device, thank you.",0
Too much freaking ads just for music,0
What happened? Since July 4th the app won't work on my phone. It keeps stopping or shutting off completely and it won't play in the background. I used this app for sleeping and can't. There is also no way to skip or relisten to anything. Please fix! We pay premium and don't want to find another app for music and podcasts.,0
Who ever makes the playlists has no taste and uses the same few songs. Shuffle algorithm is nonrandom. The app stops playing and closes frequently,0
The app is good but mine doesn't show lyrics and I have done everything the support center have written but still no lyrics,0
I use Spotify all the time. I pay for the premium version and it's worth every penny.,1
Too many damn ads and useless garbage!,0
"Works better now that I am on Android 11. But since the newest version playing music begins to lag and makes pauses when downloading new music, please fix this",0
"Love this app, never any issues, hooks up to my PS4 perfectly",1
"The update on the 28th broke the app on my phone. Can't follow progress, won't work with Bluetooth and frequently auto stops podcasts or music.",0
I love it  I enjoy the music,1
Love listening to music and Spotify is the best streaming site out their,1
UI is atrocious and the online customer service chat takes forever to get an issue resolved. I seem to have ended up with two accounts and it is impossible to identify which is which for the purpose of password reset. This is because you cannot see which email address is linked to the account in app... Very frustrating UI,0
It's my go-to daily music and podcast listening experience. Just waiting for that HiFi listening to become an option.,0
"A world of amazing music across the decades at my fingertips, only thing that worries me is how little payment the artistes recieve. Guilty conscience is the only thing that looses the app one star from me.",0
"Love it! Few suggestions: Please set the default music playing functions to ""private"" and music share turned off too. Kids these days know what's going on when the music doesn't play out aloud and plays via the Bluetooth and they get the ""public / private "" session. But not everyone does. So please kindly set the default to a form of ""analog""/ non music sharing setting and then those who understand the functions behind these settings can turn them on accordingly. Otherwise, love the app",0
It's a great app I just don't understand how to listen to one song When I touch the song I want to listen to it makes me listen to it like 10 seconds and then it stops,0
Good until recently. This glitch is really ticking me off. I open Spotify and when I exit out it keeps going then when I bring it back up it's on to whatever song and I can't stop it and I have to close Spotify every single time.,1
The latest update mess up Bluetooth connection. Fix it please. Reliability is getting worst.,0
The best,1
"Please remove the ""smart"" shuffle to be honest it's not smart it's dumb when I click the song I want to listen it gives me a song don't want no wonder why people think SoundCloud is better your app will fail if you keep this up",0
I love having a 100 song Playlist and spotify decides (even with playback options turned off) to make me listen to dogshit trash music only in my recommended for 20 songs straight.,0
Sound volume is low as compared other online music app,0
"Good, Superb & Excellent music app",1
Best music app that is free and it has everything I listen too. I can also make as many playlists that I want!,1
Instant ready to play...I love this app,1
"I loved the songs,hoping soon the lyrics were available ,im using premium account.",1
"Great collection, lyrics are increasingly available, good quality",1
"Wonderful music,great app",1
Recommendations are worse than ever. Home screen never shows anything new. And it pushes podcasts so hard. Sick of it. I'm going to quit paying for premium and try Apple Music instead.,0
"Fix your bugs, recent reviews on this app fit perfectly with the issues I encountered so far :/",1
I love Spotify the only problem is that the ads come up ever 3 songs or 2 and it just gets annoying but other wise it really easy to use and you have to have ads so I don't blame them so if you were to ask me if you should get Spotify or a different music app I would say Spotify all the way,0
"Great app ,use it for spa music in my business or fav tunes for pleasure",1
Lyrics of many songs are not available. Overall experience is amazing but i face a simple problem that while listening to song i miss some important notifications. I want to stop playing when notifications arrive or allow notifications bell while listening.,0
"How is there not an option to remove certain tabs like ""shows to try""or ""stay up to date""? The whole point of spotify is finding music that you like. I don't want to be spammed with the newest Trap or Pop or whatever. It is seriously off-putting.",0
"Give me a break here. You're asking for ratings on an App that doesn't even work. ""App doesn't work"" ... that's as good as any rating, right?! It doesn't do anything you want it to, mainly, not playing songs. I was told this was the best app to listen to music. Ha! Must've heard wrong. It's an app that shouldn't be out on the market anymore, much less being charged for it. (Oh, I pressed the one star accidentally ... can't even remove that. Jesus!)",0
"Premium for 2 years , cancel my premium and I received 3 push notifications a day to purchase premium with premium account still active . Constant app issues oh and not paying musicians ya goodbye Spotify",0
Actually this is a good app for everyone but I hope iphone users and android users doesn't have different features. I hope android users can also have the background sound features.,1
In app ads is not cool for a paid app.,0
Can't play offline songs until connecting to the internet?? What's the point of paying premium??,0
Love that I can make my own personal play list!!,1
Quality music I love it,1
"There is only one single reason this gets a 2 instead of a 5, because it annoys me every single day. If I ask my Google home to play music on Spotify and then later on connect earbuds to my phone I don't want Spotify to suddenly switch to playing on my phone so that I can spent 2 minutes trying to recast it",0
It is super irritating that you can only skip 6 songs per hour. I'm thinking I'll switch back to my other steaming app.,0
Overall experience is quite good. Doesn't shows much ads. Song recommendations are good.,1
"I love the app, but I never get the thirty minutes of uninterrupted listen it promises after an ad.",0
It's the best music player I know.,1
"Absolute rubbish. Play bar has disappeared, making everything impossible to use. Spotify is rubbish these days!!",0
Audio bit struck while seek and bass is not good,0
Best music and podcast app out there. Large selection of music and very intuitive interface. ðŸ˜,1
Every time I turn on on Spotify it keeps playing and won't turn off. I went into settings and it still won't stop,1
"The app is great! However, the bugs that we all are experiencing are becoming annoying. My music doesn't appear to be playing or it randomly stops. As a premium user this is really annoying and it makes me want to change platforms. If it isn't resolved i will be taking my money elsewhere",0
"EDIT: most of the below seem fixed as far as I can tell ðŸ˜ Original review: Seems to be getting more and more glitchy, especially when it comes to podcasts... sometimes podcasts will suddenly disappear from my downloads, other times Spotify will randomly decide to remove everything from my queue, and often the play controls randomly disappear and I have to restart the app ðŸ˜•",0
It's not that bad but why can't i just directly play the song i pressed on?,0
"I'm a Full Sail University, student. Spotify supports higher education, probably unknowningly; However, the share tool is very useful. Spotify is also a platform for new artists, not to mention it's profit sharing with with newly popular artists.",1
the amount of crashes + them removing the preview feature when you want to add song to a playlist. It just makes the app worse than it already was.Im using a different app until it gets fixed.,0
"I can not properly copy the links for anything. The App has this problem already 2 months. For sample, I can provide you with the case when this happens. When the copied links are pasted in the telegram, the app doesn't recognize it, and shows message ""unsupported browser"" instead of preview of song, album, or something else.",0
Kabhi kabhi ads ke beech me gaane Sun leta hu :). Useless app. Ads everywhere and that too so long and irritating. Better use cracked version,0
"App has a fault where the play bar vanishes and I have no control to play or stop. Support service have had me on the chat page for 5 hours so far with no progress, this involved me waiting to send a video of the screen without a play button before they would take more action. It still happens and I have so many half finished podcasts I can no longer find",0
"Any music you like is here, Have'nt used the app long enough to learn how to use it 100%. so far, I like it.",1
Worst song app because it's have an add in between of songs so worst,0
Amazing tbh free version still gives you like 90 percent of the functionality and the amount of music is exorbitant,1
"Quit messing with Rogan! The only reason Ive downloaded your buggy af app is for the podcast, btw everytime there's a ad it skips to the next podcast and restarts the last one, really annoying to try to find your place in a 3 hour podcast...",0
The app is superb but the problem is that songs lyrics are in there own language so my problem is I listen to song more than one language so is hard for me to memorize the songs that I love it's will be amazing if there is language option in lyrics thank you,0
Best music predictor. Not a miss in the bunch.,1
"It has a lot of music but there are a lot of small issues. Deluxe versions of albums that I bought on iTunes however long ago aren't available and there's no way for me to add music that I already paid for. The shuffle algorithm is straight up horrible. Also, it'll randomly switch from my liked songs to a song's ""radio"", e.g. a discovery mode. And I don't want that and I'm not sure how or why it happens",0
I like it because I can listen to music,1
This is definitely the best App for listening to all sorts of music... really great stuff!,1
at first I downloaded it and everything was fine but that's because I didn't realize it was just a 12 day free trial and I kept trying to log in using my account or a different account and I even created a new account but it all does the same thing where every time I make a playlist I can't just tap on the song and let it play through it only plays a random clip of it and I don't know why I can't tell if it's because I need to get the premium but trying to listen to music shouldn't be this hard,0
App is awesome I love songs I always listen songs using Spotify Thank you so much for the excellent awesome super and wonderfull songs If there are more new features come on up and do it 5 star Thank you,1
"As of late when I play music or a podcast there is no interface for what is playing. This leads to the fact that there is no way to pause or skip. So if I want to pause, I actually need to close the app now. Hopefully this gets fixed.",0
Their Is so many amazing song an gonras that it so hard to pick 1 but thanks to Spotify I don't have to only pick 1 I can pick 5 and Spotify finds them and gives them to me,1
"After this new update I can't even use the app at all...it shows playlists as empty and will not play anything. I tried to opened my liked list and there was NOTHING in it other than an error message saying an error had occurred and to try again. No matter how much I click it, it will not show my lists. I looked at the help forums and did everything they said to do to fix the issue and none of them fixed the issue. Not happy",0
"Day 1 Pandora user that made the switch late 2021 because of the presence, artist count, album count, etc. 2 stars is generous IMO due to the not-so-seamless integration from GalaxyWatch4 and ZFold3 hardware. Additionally, what makes me really want to drop this to 1-star is the same YouTube TV ad playing 4 times consecutively. Sure I could become a premium user, but I use Spotify for 4 hours a month at best. I won't be moving back to Pandora simply because I'm satisfied ""enough"". Is that enough?",1
Spotify is amazing,1
"I want my playlist, not your random selections",0
"I have with Spotify since 2013.. I make my own playlist....Spotify like it, because they make a pop latlist for me ...said this make for frank Cervantes.",1
"Was awesome at first, but now I have to constantly update and can never listen to downloads for some reason, super irritating.",0
"Doesn't show what's playing almost ever other day, have to either force stop the app or restart my phone to get it working properly again. Very annoying when I pay $10 a month.",0
Spotify is all that and a bag of chips.... Great app!!!,1
I love me some blues  Really like the experience here ,1
So beautiful ,1
"The mini player bar disappears constantly, the only way to bring it back is to clone/open the app. Bluetooth controls won't work with the latest update.",0
"The app has such a variety of music and gives new artist so you dont get bored of your favorite artist, however despite the apps quality the add situation is a little abnocious having to pay a fair price with no adds and offline music is a fair deal still the adds should depend on how many months/years your account was created so the longer you have uour account the less adds.",0
Used to be a 5 star review but no 2 star.. I bought premium because I was leaving for the summer and now offline music DOESNT WORK.. fix this please,0
"3 stars, would be 4 or more if they just implemented Spotify hifi. Is that too much to ask?",0
Great streaming platform,1
It is good but if kindly add lyrics that would be more good.,1
Good,1
"I mostly use this app to make playlists but you removed a super important feature for seemingly no reason. Why cant i preview a song before i add it to a playlist anymore? You can preview in playlists so the feature clearly still works, but you can't listen to a song before you add it? It just makes the ""add songs"" menu useless. I'm extremely disappointed and hope you fix your mistakes. Honestly not sure i want to even use spotify anymore, its so annoying",0
"Same as other folks here - long time premium user, but the app is SO GLITCHY now. This week songs just stop playing and the song bar disappears so I have to restart the app. Also been having problems with it functioning properly with Google maps in drive mode.",0
Too many ads! I understand the ap will have some ads but it's constantly giving me ads. The ap says it will give me 30 minutes of uninterrupted music but then 10 minutes later more ads(I set a timer at night). It feels like it's just a push to get premium.,0
It would be better if spotify provides a feature to hide or delete some of the recently listened podcast or song.,0
Excellent choices so happy with my choices nostalgia finding music I loved back in the 80s and 90s,1
Good app all songs available,1
I listen my music and anyway my music was stopped. Why? I tried to turn on that and you wrote me: This playlist is unavailable. Bruh,0
"I cant pay with my MasterCard, I have used two different cards now. Spotify please help",0
I really enjoy my music. Spotify is the best App.,1
Whenever i try to play a specific song sometimes it will jump to something completly random.,0
"Too many glitches recently, all have been reported in the reviews submitted below, please fix ASAP!!!",0
"I love this premium feature but in our country it takes lot of taxes from tele communication service, so Spotify should use nagad payment method",0
Why is it that I am paying for Spotify Premium yet I have to listen to ads on podcasts?,0
"It's SOOOOO good, just sit back and listen to music while your playing video games or drawing and many more. I'm obsessed with this app. It is so worth downloading!",1
"In podcasts, i would like each podacast to only show me unplayed as default. I know there is an ""New Episodes"". But i want to set this in each podcast. Hide all played episodes. Please add",0
"considering how you're like a multi-billion dollar company, you wouldn't expect this app to be THIS bad. it's really laggy and crashes way too often. sometimes you try to search for a song but can't cause nothing shows up. and the main menu keeps loading for 7 years after opening the app every time. also; bring back the X on the perma noti. why would you even get rid of it? it's so much more troublesome getting rid of it without it.",0
"Playlist problems, I've used this app for years and recently it's taken a serious dive. It will randomly start playing random songs in the middle of a chosen song. I will start playing my Playlist and it will start with my song and as soon as it's over, skip to a random song I've never heard.",0
"By far the best music app, bar none",1
Great source for music. Is a bit pricey tho,1
I encountered the same problem with one of the reviews. I cannot access the app. It only shows the logo and wouldn't respond afterwards.,0
App is good... But there is nothing like 30 minutes uninterrupted listening after an ad. Have to listen to ads between each song. Sometimes youtube seems to be less pushing than spotify to buy premium.,0
"I love it.... I will recommed this app for everyone to useâ™¡ i loved the most is that it shows lyrics in every single song and it it has a really few adds, you all guys know how irritating the adds areðŸ˜¢but you will not face that problem in spotifyðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘I loved your application.",1
"I have no complaints! Big selection! I don't like ads, but they're in every app, so no big deal.",0
"The latest update ruined it. Crashes, controls disappear, won't switch to online after offline, and more.",0
It's a good streaming app u just gatta go to premium for the real fun,1
Android 11 update has broken the app.,0
why can't I play the song I want and I can't skip and rewind please fix I'm disappointed,0
This is a great . I listen to a lot of foreign music ðŸŽµ ican find everything I search for I search for.,1
Used 3.5GB of my mobile data in the foreground while in offline mode and listening to downloaded music only.,0
Taking back two stars because it stopped and won't let me listen to any podcast only music,0
I would like to play the song in full also stop with so much abertizing and please let me play my own song for example I play xxxtenacion and put lii mosey please work on that,0
". i find many artist,s and smooth play...",1
Absolutely one of the BEST platforms to experience your favorite songs! Outstanding method to identify new enjoyable music! Love it!!!,1
Vast collection! All genres !!! Enjoy,1
We can play the songs we like,1
"would give it a 5 but recently i can't preplay small segments of songs when im in the ""add songs"" section in playlists. hope they add it back cause I'm not familiar with all the songs recommended and i want to know how they sound before adding them to my playlist :/",0
"Good selection of music to choose from, and easy to use",1
It's a very good music app but it would be nice if the lyrics came in Tamil,1
This app keeps getting worse and worse. My time with spotify is surely nearing its end.,0
I would give it 5 stars but when I update it I can't really play my music anymore an I can't find my Playlist,0
Love how suggestions of music come up and you get to listen to artists you haven't heard of. Also it reminds you about music you've not listened to in a while.,1
App always crashes and playback often skips or lags,0
This is the best app for music if you have a premium account Crazy number of songs wonderful user interface and what not The premium membership is worth every single penny To access such high quality songs at a really affordable membership price is just ,1
1 Star Because Too Many Adds which is 30 seconds and Sometimes 2Ads that means 1 minute ads. Please Solve this. But Still i Love Listening Music Everyday in Spotify.,1
Just able to here some Playlist of certain artist and Era.,1
Very nice audio experience and plenty of music and podcast to hear,1
"What happened to the Android app. Playback stops in the middle of songs for no apparent reason and the ability to fast fwd thru a podcast or even between tracks of certain playlists like Discover Weekly is gone. I pay $16/month but as of '22 cannot even rewind, FFWD, skip tracks or even pause?",0
Pausing- app is broken and keeps stopping. The pause/play/skip bar is missing. I've uninstall and reinstalled and still no difference. Time to cancel premium,0
"Without advertisements is better I think but,wonderful",1
"Enjoying the lyrics functionality the most, awesome feature ðŸ‘ðŸ‘",1
"Very good music player, perhaps the best, but the fact you NEED premium (10 bucks) to turn off shuffle is unnecessary and greedy",0
Super experience Mainly BTS song ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ I like it so much Spotify ðŸ¤©,1
Best application for listening songs i have ever seen,1
"It's absolutely worth the cost. I'll take it over any free music app, no question. All the music and podcasts available, that I want. Joe Rogan brought me to Spotify!!",1
"I considered getting YouTube premium, I did, it's better. You just got compared to YouTube premium, how's that?",0
"Originally I gave 5 stars, now I can only give 3 stars since you guys seem to have deleted carplay.. I get it, you have Car thing now but I don't think it's right to force us to buy an item we may not want to buy by deleting an option which used to be included in your app, especially not knowing I pay a monthly subscription. I sincerely hope carplay finds its way back.",0
The songs in my playlist would not even play and would only play suggested songs. PLEASE FIX THIS! PUT AN OPTION FOR SUGGESTED SONGS! PLEASEðŸ˜­,0
"The shuffle playlist has to be improved. It keeps playing almost the same song over and over again regardless of the huge amount of music I listed in the same playlist; ultimately the reason why I get bored with my favorite songs too quickly. I hope u fix this, cuz I need a shuffle optionâ€”not selective.",0
"It is what its supposed to be, i love it,i just dont like the fact that once you download an album in one device you cannot download it again in another,ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘so i cant always listen to my favourite albums offline.",0
"The music is great, a good array of podcasts too. My only concern is, the Group Session links don't work? Could you guys please add a fix to this? :D",1
This new update ruined everything. There's no play/pause button anymore.,0
"I was running into an issue where it would play music fine, unless it was a song I had downloaded, then it would play the first 10 seconds and stop, and I could not figure out a way to play the song. I have fixed the issue by undownloading all of my music, but I do not want to risk re downloading it only to run into the issue. One plus 5 phone. I am short on storage, and my friend that had a similar issue is also short on storage so maybe that is the issue. I would still consider that a glitch.",0
Good music selection,1
You can easily reach the type of playlist you want but there is some ad issue. Otherwise it is best app,1
"Freemium app. If you aren't paying money, and an artist you like drops a new single, its not even guaranteed to be one of the songs you hear before you use all your skips, even if you start from the album page that the song is on.",0
"It's a worst application, they show to many advertisements after each song play. Worst experience.",0
Absolutely better than other music players. I just want to suggest about what we have been searched to create a playlist with that.,1
"Very Cheap advertising for premium, not expected from Spotify.., ðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤«ðŸ˜ðŸ™‚",0
"Today I had to listen to 3 long ads (over a minute) every two songs for an entirety of a drive. How desperate and greedy can a corporation get. Oh well, back to mp3s we go!",0
Imagine downloading music and podcasts and not having access to them without an internet connection. Thats how smart the developers of this app are.,1
Suddenly your app keep on crashing. What's happening? I already uninstall and install it seversl times. I also reset my phone however it doesn't change. Still crashing,0
"Everything with the app is ok, except the ad thing. At first they will not show many ads to keep the people believing it's good.but gradually . The most irritating part comes. I have almost studied all the ads audio , because it's repeating forever. It's too much. They are doing this to us to be their premium customer. So we have to pay for it. But what if poor people wants to listen without interruption? At first app was fine but now the most hated app is this,u people better download ytmusic.",0
Continous music. I don't know why I didn't discover this app earlier,0
Problem is am finding it difficult to play music in my play list. And it's impossible to repeat or play a previous song. Is it that I don't know how to use this app or what?,0
Now that spotify has got lyrics for most of it's songs!! It's become way better!! ðŸ’žâœ¨,0
Thpe most perfect Music platform i have seen soo far. Just perfect,1
The computer version is way better,1
Excellent service with all chromecast devices,1
Each time I make a play list it always adds damn song that I don't want to listen to and I can't remove them and that's why i rate it a 1/5,1
Easy to use and navigate.,1
Great lots of music 14-18 has cuss words but overall super good quality not alot of ads only one per 30 mins,1
Good however I can't move the app from my system storage to my sd card...,1
If I could I would give it a zero it will add songs that you didn't put on your Playlist and you can't take it off,0
"I am a trance , edm and bass songs lover. On Spotify i found my favourite songs here",1
Why did you idiots remove the play bar? How am I supposed to pause or skip songs?,0
Stop adding random trash songs in my playlist and play the ones that I added ffs,0
The smart shuffle is frustrating because its adding songs Ive already had on the playlist Ive also noticed some of my songs were swapped around I just found that a BUNCH of songs were removed from my playlist and smart shuffle is just recommending the ones that were already supposed to be on there,1
"Excellent app.,with up to date info.",1
Idk what has happened to this perfect app really disappointing,0
Love how you can build your own play list and play off line wouldn't be without it now,1
"After update software, i can't open spotify via pioneer car head unitðŸ˜‘",0
I will try to play my playlist and it will automatically play random different songs that i never even added.,0
Love Spotify and the rotating music content I find on here. The adds need a little work but overall a great music app.,1
Good selection of all type of music.,1
Nice new songs ,1
It is the worst song app It has more ads then songsðŸ˜‚,0
"After years of using it im very pleased with the functionality of the app. Only complaint is that we can't dismiss suggestions for podcasts, artists etc. From Spotify. My home page is slowly turning into hell as I only see Spotify suggestions for podcasts and I never even listened to them.",0
"Its easily the best streaming platform out of all of them, only issue is of recent it has been crashing more and i have to re-download my library, thats the only reason its not getting 5 stars",0
"High Quality, good playlists, very nice layout, easy to use. Still perfect.",1
Spotify helped me get through 7 days and 6 nights in the hospital. I dont watch much TV. But I could listen to the songs I wanted to hear. Thanks,1
Free Use is therapeutically helping me on the go and at Home. Spotify is a great tool.,1
"App is great for finding podcast or songs, but app likes to stop all the time shows it still playing but no sound and yes I've update the app and restarted my phone but also happens on my kids iPhone and I'm android so it's a spotify thing not phone's.",0
"The app has become increasingly buggy to the point it feels like they need to re-write everything from scratch now. Transport widget keeps disappearing so you can't play/stop/skip, songs crash, skips onto artist radio playlist halfway through an album, keeps dropping sync when using with Alexa so have to close the app and restart to change what is playing. Using a 2 month old Samsung Galaxy and have used spotify on various phones for years.",0
"On the pc worked great,on phone however...Why do I get only 6 skips per hour and why doesnt it put the song I chose and there are 4 ads one after eachother.2 stars",0
I have taken subscription still i get so many ads after every song,0
two stars for now because i'm experiencing a trouble which is i can't pay the premium packs. it's always written 'unable to connect' meanwhile my signal is all okay. pls fix this.,0
"Recently the app has gotten really buggy - random pauses in the middle of a song or podcast, sometimes songs won't start playing, etc. Today's update is even worse and has made it so I can't even open it up. It just sits there and loads endlessly. I usually love Spotify, but the app is currently unusable. I'll update my review once they fix it.",0
"I'm a premium user and I can't stand the mother's day premium subscription gift spam every time I open this app, it is irrational to pay for something like that.",0
I love this app for the songs and content but it is so glitchy! I'm constantly closing and restarting it. Super annoying!,0
I like the quality and it's easy to use but I also don't know if it's normal that you can't go in a radio station like for example when I want to go in Karol G radio station it just shows other stations and won't really let you play or see the songs in that station I just want to know if its normal or not.,0
why is play/pause button on the left side instead of in the middle for android phones?,0
Agree with other recent posts- keeps crashing on me. Please fix this as I love listening to Spotify when it works!! ðŸ™,1
All my songs in one spot love it. New old up and coming brilliant ðŸ‘,1
Best music streaming app hands down,0
The app plays automatically when connected to Bluetooth car even when the app is closed which is extremely annoying and disruptive.,0
EXCELLENT! IF YOU LOVE LISTENING TO MUSIC ðŸŽ¶ â™¥,1
"skips, always. 4 or 5 commercials between tracks. difficult to play albums or sole artists.",0
Nagware app that keeps reminding me to switch to premium and interrupts my listening experience but overall a good app that I like very much,1
Lyrics of some songs still not available...please do this,0
App just crashes when I open it,0
"I seem to be having the same problems as many others on here. Since the latest update, the app has been really glitchy. It will randomly stop playing, randomly start playing, there's no play bar and I have to force stop the app multiple times to get it back, or it will even say it's playing a completely different song to what is actually playing. In the many years since I started using and paying for Spotify, it's never been worse than it is now.",0
"Been subbed for many years, and I'm a top listener (top 2%) and I have only found one song not on Spotify. So yea, great stuff.",1
The app won't let me play my music and keeps playing random songs that I don't want,0
Latest Samsung Galaxy update for s10 5G may have caused bugs. I can no longer see the song that is playing in the app or on the lock screen.,0
The latest update has been horrible. It barely plays one song without stopping. I pay for premium and it's not worth the money.,0
"Great app that definitely outshines it's competitors in variety, quality, and user-friendlyness. It has good 3rd party support from apps like discord, that allow you to display Spotify as your status. Super great music platform and I have used it without any problems!",1
"Spotify keeps me sane during the day, and it allows me to listen to continue to discover new music.",1
"Easy play, and all singers and songs I wanted is here.Thank you",1
"After last Update the music player didn't work well, after this update the app keeps crashing irregulary every few minutes. Really, really anoying and specially for a huge company like Spotify an embarrassing bad software quality for quite a while now.",0
App can play in the background. Lots of music styles. Awesome pre-picked daily music selections. 5 stars,1
"I only have this app to listen to the rogan podcast, CONSTANTLY I'm in the middle of an episode and all of a sudden it stops playing, skips to the next episode and marks the epsiode i was actually listening to as fully played, and i have no idea where i was in the episode when i got kicked out. This has been a problem for several months. It will happen at the same spot, in the same episode evey time, so i have to find that particular spot in the episode and skip past it in order to finish.",0
It would be great if you all let us pick our music and stop adding in what you assume we will like. I am now listening to one of your add ins and it is violin instrumental. I am not in the mood for what your choices are. Beyond that pain Spotify is good. But keep up add ins and Im gone!,0
"It is really the best music app I've ever used, there's not any single issue happening in this, Spotify wrapped was so good, the music quality, the playlist, everything is great... Thank you Spotify for this great experience!",1
Love it I'm a regular I have over 10000 songs 72 playlists,1
Songs stop playing randomly and over the last two days the player bar disappeared so I can't pause / skip / etc. I have to force close the app to make playback stop. Works again after I restarted phone.,0
Very good app. Used Daliy. Enough said,1
This app is really good in time of music so cool let me give 4 ðŸŒŸ,1
Best music app i ever use. Shout out to amazon music for being doo doo making me love Spotify even more.,1
"really? 4 ads for one skip, im listening to more ads then music",0
"Great music, current music and oldies as well. I enjoy it several times a week.",1
"Spotify is a very wonderful app with diffirent music and genres , but the downside of the app is that ads keep interrupting and that you only get 6 skips . I would recommend but if you want to listen offline you must buy premium",0
I've been using Spotify since I first started using a phone. I can bear with the ads and everything but for some reason recently the music would just stop when I went to other apps and I'd have to start the song from the beginning again. It happened a couple times and I thought that it's okay but it's been happening so much recently its really getting on my nerves,0
Nice music app,1
So awesome,1
Unbearable bugs on flagship phone largest player,0
Great exploring different music learning new sounds. It's great thank you,1
Amazing app for listening ðŸŽ§ songs â˜ºï¸,1
It has every song you could possibly want and more.,1
A stupid app I can't even play songs,0
When I want to play a song but have to wait for 3 days of adverts and other songs I don't want to hear... Well that's why I don't use this app at all,0
"I love it but, since I got my new phone I can't get it to boot up",0
Automatic 1 star for not having an ability to edit home tab layout (cannot hide/remove podcasts).,0
Top tunes at the touch of a few buttons.,1
Even with just shuffle you could still make a playlist that plays songs that you like but it will be like the radio and you can't pick which song plays. So make a playlist of all songs you like. Also you can play the music over other games as backgrounds music.,1
"This is the best app to have if you love music, pocascts and other stuff. I have premim and with it I can download all of my playlists, I have unlimited skips, and I don't have to listen to annoying adds. It it awesome.",1
"All of a sudden my podcasts stop working, and won't load. I get a message that says no episodes are available. I I rebooted, etc, it still is not working.ðŸ˜¥ It works on my laptop, just stopped working bon my phone.After update, all my playlist have reset.",0
"Works okay at the moment, but there's a slight issue where the genre slider at the top of the liked songs list cannot slide. :)",0
its an awesome music appwith minimal ads in it,1
"spotify just randomly crashed on me today -_- pls maybe its just the day, its been weird since i woke up but this is annoying. lagging a lot, app keeps closing by itself and doesnt open, and it keeps freezing the screen and idk its just not working :< other than that its normally a decent music app, love that u can make playlists and they have a pretty wide variety of music so its all good when its working i guess :)",0
Not good keeps adding song's I don't want to listen to and it's very annoying.,0
"I can't even play songs in my playlist, it only shows like 5 seconds of the song I wanna play on my playlist",0
The only thing that I would appreciate is if they would had a better software for when you tap the shuffle icon.,0
Love this have been using for 5+ years but could not enjoy without the subscription,1
"Got a free 2 month premium trial from a friend and started getting ads after one month. Also, sound quality is inferior to Pandora.",0
"It's my ""go to"" app for superlative sonics.",1
This is best listing app I ever seen,1
Amazing service,1
I bundle with Hulu and it's super affordable and I just love that it's everything I need music/podcast wise!,1
The overall experience is amazing. The service and quality of sound is great as well but I'd love it if there would be more time stamps for sleep timer like 2 hours or something more than one hour,1
"Absolutely terrible... the ads are so bad, at least make a variety of them... I'm not getting pick n save, old el Paso, premium, anchor, give a variety and make it so these ads get at max 15 ads a year, and that is VERY fair, it has turned into a cash grab and I'm so sick of it... grow some common sense and play a variety of ads, the small companies cant get their day in the sun because you keep playing the exact same ad for legitimately over a year, with 0 changes... FIX IT!",0
,1
can u guys plz add visualizer to the Spotify widget so that it'd look more amazing along with the option to next and previous play and pause button.,1
you are off the air especially when the first-time i tune in your channel. Please check.,0
"Gay asf you can't even listen to music normally without some dumb ads, plus it skips not to the next song but some random song from the middle of your playlist",0
"""Now playing"" bar keeps disappearing every now and then. Has been like this for a year or so.",0
Fantastic best music application,1
"Why can't i shuffle... shuffle should work for playlist, you can remove is from albums.",0
"Been using Spotify since 2014, if you would have asked me up until recently I would have said it's the best. Yet, lately the player hasn't been showing up, or updating the song that's playing. The only way to ""fix"" it is to close the app and open it again, but this is only a temp fix. Was fine when it rarely happened, but I don't recommend this service for new users as it currently is. If things don't change asap I'm just gonna switch services and stop my premium.",0
"Hi, I'm old Spotify user and I genuinely love this app. They provide you best quality addvertisements and they sometimes roast themselves so if you're having a breakdown at 2:34am listening to your fav song, they're just gonna roast themselves and make you laugh. Sometimes it's annoying when songs comes in between when I vibe on adds at my terrace but it's manageable. I thought about purchasing Spotify premium but I bought apple music cause it feels illegal to buy Spotify premium as a brown guy",1
Has all my music but same but I use this app everyday,0
It has to many ads.. but It is a super one app for listening ..,1
Can listen to songs in the background while using other apps,0
"its already been a yr n ur not even updating us, ive red the other reviews n we ALL have the SAME PROBLEMS! its not fair for us because we have to buy premium in order to unshuffle it? horrible service if u ask me. idc bout u updating the spotify, what we said needs to be done. not be ignored",0
Stays the best user friendly music app for me!!!,1
"I have constant issues with Spotify and connections. It take multiple tries to open the app, I've tried updating it, uninstalling and reinstalling it multiple times and still the issues continue. It happens when I'm on high-speed wifi connection, its really frustrating. I pay for a premium account and I've been asking myself, what am I really paying for.",0
Amazing interface for releasing music or podcasts! ðŸ‘,1
"I got this app so I could listen to my favorite music but it wont even play the song I want without playing like 20 suggested songs, and dont even bother trying to remove them from the playlist because it just adds more, I'm uninterested in hearing what you want me to hear so I'm uninstalling this app",0
"Spotify helps me reach out to ebooks, podcasts and all interesting stuff all at once.",1
I love spotify's premium version but these days I can't seem to gat premium I hope you could fix the prepaid option for premium because its having a lot of errors. I am really disappointed and annoyed by it.,0
Love it. But you getting carried away with the Ads,0
"All the music options are great, but the recommended music is awful. Like, not even close to the type of music I enjoy. I wish their predictive algorithm was better.",0
Really happy that I tried this. Such a wonderful selection and variety of music styles. I can listen to my favorites from across six decades!,1
Easy to use  Great music app links to Playstation network,1
After using an old iPod for years this is a very nice step up My wife and I can share playlists too,1
"Spotify has been the best music app have seen in my entire life, kudos to the originator, from the graphics and composure all are top notch ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¾ðŸ¥°",1
The best app ever to listen to music ðŸŽ¶,1
Good adds,1
"Not able to login ,every time says Something went wrong ,try again later",0
"Though song collection is very good but my complaint is that i paid Rs 389/- as 3month subscription to Spotify premium yet my account still displays Spotify free...When you have downloaded songs as premium account holder , you are not able to play them offline...then why should one go for Spotify premium ?",0
"Performance Issues, especially when starting the app or switch between apps.",0
The mobile app just keeps getting worse and worse because they want you to get premium. The ads don't bother me as much but the fact that now it's practically unusable in the mobile app is really annoying (and also doesn't make me want premium any more than before!!) I used to love love Spotify but uggghhhh!! You can hardly do anything in this app anymore.,0
its great to share music and spark creativity. even better you can and have access to podcast that can truly change your life if and when you apply tried and tested principles they teach,1
Takes forever to open. Fix that please,1
Excellent,1
Can't login. App says account is currently set to offline. Login link sent to email is always expired. No trouble logging in with Spotify Lite.,0
Too many ads :/,0
I'm in Spotify premium but why there still ads I'm try to relaxing and suddenly ads appears pls fix this ðŸ¥±,0
Worst app in the world I am already online and this app says you are offline. Not able to use this app. Guide me how to cancel premium subscription.,0
"Despite having spotify premium my home page always has a banner ad for some podcast episode with some celebrity in it yhat I could not care less about at least when there was a ""not interested"" button that didn't work it gave me the illusion of control but now there isn't even that. Thanks for having baked in ads. Also thanks for being to sure to not have any ability at all to say ""I know I don't like this so stop showing it to me"", epsecially in the context of podcasts.",0
I love that I can listen to my downloaded music without using my data.,1
Excellent music app. five star Every song you can find here a-z. EverythingðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œ,1
"It's a good app for streaming music. You can find almost every song that you want to listen. But! If you don't purchase ðŸ‘›ðŸ’¸ its premium membership, then you will have a terrible experience. Between each and every song you will have two advertisement (1 minute total) describing how good the Premium Membership is! And this thing will just ruin your mood. â˜¹ï¸ If you can afford rs.129 monthly for premium membership, then it's okay. It's a 5 star app. ðŸ‘",0
"Great app but a few days ago when i choose a song to play it just played like 10 secs then stopped, it started to get annoying maybe im doing something wrong tho",0
Exceptional,1
Always stopping for no reason lately,0
"Spotify is mint. I love the playlists it creates for me. They're always playing a variety of songs based on my mood which changes genres like Alberta changes it weather. I love this app. Honestly can't say anything bad about it so ya, I'm feeling like it keeps me fresh on what's hot and not overly mainstream. Couple claps for this app.",1
Spotify is okay but I can't loop it or choose my song. YouTube let's me do that. I can do that on my computer Spotify but not mobile. It sucks.,0
"Terrible app. i have used this app for years to come but now I have to pay to listen and choose my songs now because my ""14 day trial"" has ended, this is just a big pay to listen app and it adds stuff fi dont want in my playlist and removed alot of stuff that you could use for free to premium users only. Old spotify was better,SoundCloud and YouTube here I come!",0
"Love it, been using this app for a few years now. I originally started on pandora but spotify has pulled ahead as far as updates and overall function. My favorite part is at the end of every year it gives a summary of all the music/podcasts you listened to. I spent over 137,000 minutes listening ðŸ˜‚",1
"Ok so why I rate this app one, is because when I tried to play my fav song, and then the song started to play other song and I tried to play another song ITS STILL PLAYING OTHER SONG PLS FIX IT",0
Love the music but hate the fact that every time I get in my car it goes on to autoplay and it never used to. Can't even turn it off.,0
Very hot app,1
Wow! nice but I can't download any music,0
Why did they remove the ability to exit the app by right or left swiping the spotify player widget on the phones notification bar? At least add an X button or something so we can easily close out the app. YouTubes notification bar widget has a X button.,0
"I need to restart my phone cause the music won't stop, there's no control bar!!!",0
"Go woke, Go Broke! Spotify is the freedom platform and it's just better than amazon music. Looking at the reviews that are obvious plants from other platforms. I have had no issues and there is far more offered on sporify than amazons music service. Even though i had premium amazon music i kept getting commercials to switch to the family plan. I contacted Amazon and they said that i couldn't turn off the commercial. Every time i logged on just about. Spotify has the added benefit of podcas",1
Spotify Devs WHAT THE HELL .. I'm paying for an app that has disappearing controls and STOPS intermittently since the last update or just pauses. IT'S ANNOYING. FIX IT. I'd like to see some free time come my way for this ridiculousness. Terrible experience.,0
Love it. Great selections very extensive library found a lot of my favorites.,1
I can't listen to my liked songs on my television via PlayStation other than that it's a really good music app.,1
Love this app. By far this is the best music app. I've tryed the other most popular music apps and I keep finding my self back on Spotify,1
Lyrics are not showing in my tablet Samsung galaxy A7 lite (please tell me the solution )it's my kindly request from you ðŸ™,0
Yeah it's fine when it works properly shame that's a rare occasion,1
Too many ads.,0
"Lots of errors after most recent update. Randomly jumps to a different playlist when I lock my phone. Can't always control from lock screen or headphones. Have to completely close app to get music to stop playing. I logged out and reinstalled the app, no changes.",0
"Unusable on Samsung phone (works perfectly fine on any other devices I have). On my Samsung flip 3, the app doesn't even allow you to select a song and play it from your liked playlist, or an artists page. For whatever reason, it seems like you are required to have spotify premium in order to play the songs you actually want to play. Yet this has never been the case for me on anything else I use.",0
New to Spotify n my only regret is being such a late bloomer. Didn't know I was missing out on so my great tunes. But better late than never right!!!,0
Great experience with TREASURE songs â¤ï¸ðŸ’Ž,1
"Respect them for not caving to the cancel mob. If you don't like a channel, just change to something you like. Plenty of options to find something of your liking. If you can't find something you like. Maybe start your own channel. It's that simple!",1
"Ads on Premium Disgusting! They're obviously not part of the podcast I'm listening to because I've listened to it on yt, absolutely filthy work Spotify. I moved from Pandora to Spotify a few years ago because of ads on Premium, guess it's time to start looking again.",0
"Honestly, there are songs that are definitely missing, but it's my Go-To for my music!!",0
"Great if your like me & love podcasts, great choice, wide variety of artists, speakers, radio hosts, those who like to hear the sound of their own voice, lol, that cover a very wide rage of topics, subjects, genres, interests, facts and epiphanies.",1
why do I pay for a subscription when the app constantly glitches... ðŸ™ƒ cancelled,0
Always have given me great Playlist.,1
I used to love Spotify because it doesn't take much data and even play songs when data gets exhausted. But from about one week it has been using a lot of data and becuz of this reason I'm unable to listen songs cuz I'm a student and nowadays online classes are going on so I can't waste my data on listening to songs. So please make sure your app doesn't use much data because it's really disappointing ðŸ˜¢.,0
I think it's a great app but I wish they could add back the function where you can click to listen to a short clip of the song before adding it to your playlist,0
Please fix the problems ðŸ˜­ Im a paying user and the 'now playing' is gone. And every once in a while the music randomly stops.,0
The experience was great but I gave four stars instead of five because there is no ofline option to play music without Internet connection.,0
"WORST MUSIC APP EVER. You can't even play an actual song without ten million ads and premium stuff being shoved in your face. Spotify seriously needs to go out of business or something cause you can't even listen to music. I'm sorry if I'm overreacting but my god JUST LET ME LISTEN TO MUSIC!! WORST ""MUSIC"" APP EVER!!!! I AM PROBABLY DELETING MY SPOTIFY ACCOUNT!!",0
"Great service but no longer plays album fully ,after one song or not even that chosen song plays suggested song and interrupts flow and choice rather than just play after album done, defeats purpose of choosing albun and disruptive with unwanted songs",0
Redecillas aap sirisoly it doesn't work properly even not open porply .ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ when I play song and .I went back to home then suddenly song Stoped this is not happen one but four to five time .ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ If I can't listen the music in background while working in another app so why should I have download this app? I should listen music in other music aap or on YouTube .,0
"I LOVE spotify! I very rarely have any problems but I'm seriously getting annoyed since the last update. The app will open to a black screen with the symbol and stay there. I have tried all the tips on the user community. Including batter optimizing settings, permissions and a clean reinstall and still will not work. Please help! I pay the ridiculous fee for premium family. I don't want to cancel my subscription and move to something else. I will change my review when fixed.",0
I get all the songs I like,1
For a pricey monthly fee the app should work the way it's expected to.. but unfortunately it no longer does... Constantly pausing when you don't want it to no pause button visible when you do want to pause no currently playing information screen So no way to skip forward back etc... And when the currently playing screen is available (often have to uninstall reinstall) still does not rotate to landscape mode ... Been waiting for this basic feature for literally years,0
Haven't experienced issues in the past until the most recent update. Now the playback controls keep disappearing so I need to restart the app everytime it happens. Spotify also cuts out suddenly. I've tried reinstalls and it still doesn't solve the issue. I can see many others are experiencing the same thing so it is a new set of bugs that needs to be fixed. Please sort this out asap Spotify.,0
"Constant issues with podcast playback. App loses track where it left off frequently. Encumbering interface, the watch video for 30min ad free rarely ever works.. Could be much better, but they focus on spewing ads every couple minutes. Horrible horrible app",0
Nice App to enjoy musics of your choice. Keep up the good work. I live everything about the app. I encourage all music lovers to have this app. I love you Spotify â¤â¤â¤,1
Doesn't always work through my car play system. Very frustrating. Especially noticeable in the last couple of weeks,0
Lots of bugs. Jre video is a mess. Needs alot of work. Used to be better.,0
Nice selection of songs and easy to use layout. Recommend,1
"IMMEDIATELY after I decided to get spotify premium the app began frequently crashing or sparratically skip back to the beginning of a song, which coincidentally never happened when I was using free spotify. I was willing to pay for a better experience and got a worse one. Youtube premium far surpasses this product because youtube music and youtube itself share one payment that doesn't make the app unusable.",0
I love spotify.. great music.. good memories.,1
Really enjoy the choices of music,1
Dropping my review based on the latest update. Really loved the app for 2 years now they've removed the preview. I'm paying for premium and it's not premium anymore.,0
FARKIN WOW LOVE THIS APP not a song me or my friends and family have not been able to find over 12 months member and loving it. THANK YOU,1
"I pay for premium don't give me pop-up ads. The new car mode doesn't let you control the music from the car at all, which is incredibly unsafe and asinine. The new lyrics feature is garbage and makes the player lag. I am this close to just trashing Spotify and swapping to another music service. Update: Not even the basic functionality of prev/next song works consistently any more. That's it. I'm done.",0
"Forced ""recommend songs"", music apps really do suck these days.",0
The major problem with spotify mobile is I cannot listen to the songs I want. It always goes to a random playlist that plays everything else other than what I want to.,0
The music is great and I love the made for you playlists. But the app always seems to qlitch lately. Sometimes it won't play through Android auto. It randomly stops playing and im always having to uninstall and reinstall the app,0
"New update completely broke the app - glitches, widget is useless, music doesn't play properly, controls disappear constantly",0
All good To Easy Spotify Rock's,1
Love it to bits get all my favorite music and my old time evergreens,1
I enjoy every music from Spotify,1
Great music of the 70s and 80s,1
Car mode is annoying!! Im sick of having to choose. Stop car mode please.,0
"Ok, the latest update is just horrible, there is a limitation of the number of skips i can do per hour, and i can only play my playlist with shuffle, now my hardwork of making the order of the songs are just ruined, don't download this, plus you need to hear all the other parts of the song just to listen to the chorus, just... Don't download this, you're wasting your time, i don't knwo if they will change this tho",0
"Wouldn't let me select my fav artists, and skip button didn't work either",0
Gud music enjoy it daily keep it up also try too speed up the app as sometimes it gets slow but for the most part gud,1
"It's showing that I'm not connected to internet. Believe me I have tried everything ..even I asked for help in customer care service provider of Spotify, they were giving me the casual ideas which I already knew ,bruhhh I came there cause I have done attempts already and you are a service provider , so dumb !!! Well,I tried to make new account too but same ,it's not working. I'm so done with Spotify.",0
"Too many minor issues for the market leader. Playback stops without reason, especially in Podcasts, playback works fine but controls disappear so app has to be force stopped to get them back. The thing were you pick a song on a play list and then jumps to another random track as you click out of Spotify! None of these are terrible but they collectively damage the user experience and should have been fixed.",0
"Spotify has been GREAT so far, although there is a weird glitch when I switch back from my tabs where the song playing isnt showing, so I have to just close the app entirely. WasnÂ´t super bothersome at first until it kept happening. Will update my review if problem desists.",0
"Sometimes crashes, oftentimes can't seem to get signal although the other apps seem to have no problem at all",1
"Every update continues to add a bug, and not fix the bugs from the previous update. In other words, the app is getting worse and I regret installing each new update. I'm considering looking for a new music service.",0
There music suggestions are so bad even with premium.,0
Love having this app on my phone. This is the best music app I have ever tried. I love how they make you your own music playlist based on what you enjoy listening to. I recommend trying this app out for anyone who loves music!,1
"I love the music experience, i however feel the search option could do with some improvements",1
It would be better when flicking through playlists if you leave one list and then went back to it it took you to the last song you were playing. Same as when you search a song if you could play it from a play list and then continue playing from that play list.,0
Was nice if u reduce the length of the ad,0
Almost everything. Missing some iconic albums though. De la soul is dead to be exact,0
Love spotify. Way better than YouTube.,1
"I accidentally delete the spotify data, yeah that's my fault. But I try to reinstall it and now I just stuck in the logo loading screen",0
"The algorithm is amazing, terrible android app",1
Love my Spotify App!!,1
"Spotify SO FAR, doesn't seem to want to control the narative. 9/10",0
"Well I gave it a four star rating because when I play a song it just keeps on playing the song in my playlist and I can remove the song when I fully exit the app,so it's pretty annoying. Other than that,I really like everything else just besides the annoying part.so it's a pretty good app to me",1
"Latest updates have been causing the app to crash repeatedly, won't display currently playing song (so there are no controls), and songs keep playing even after swiping up to close the app.",0
Always a pleasant experience listening to my favorite tunes and easy to use!,1
Spotify is an amazing app.,1
"If you have a free account don't even bother downloading the app. You can't choose what songs you want to play, you can only shuffle. On top of this, the app forces you to listen to ""suggested songs"" and will not allow you to continue to listen to the music actually in your playlist. A free account works perfectly on the web browser, but the app is actual garbage.",0
It's just so great ðŸ‘ the amount of wonderful types of music ðŸŽ¶ at your fingertips and listening to the immaculate playback each time you go into a different genre without any problems or hassle at all. Spotify is 100% for me!!,1
I love this app I gave four stars because there is no such this as perfect you can always better your best keep striving for perfection and you will keep going God Bless!!!!!,1
"I don't know how, but they got access to my account during an identity theft investigation. VERY SKETCHY! Considering the fact that they do not have my account nor routing number and before I could get access to put money into my NEW account, they took the monthly amount and caused a new issue.",0
My most enjoyed app. No adds and good music as you want am.,1
Another music stream that keeps my mind open to the real issues in the U.S.O.A.,1
So many bugs. I have restart and reinstall a few times.,0
Worst update not working with Google assistant yesterday it was working but now it's not working after reinstalling of Spotify,0
There are too many adds pls reduce the amount of adds in normal subscription also.,0
Got it for Joe Rogan. If they turf him I'm deleting it. The free app sucks. Doesn't play the songs you select most of the time.,0
"i made a 5 hour long playlist, but when i clicked play, it didn't play a single song that i put on that playlist. i wish i could leave a 0 star review. edit: ads are louder than the music. its very startling to have a loud ad blaring in my ear all of a sudden. it was so bad once that i quickly swiped my earbud out of my ear, scratching my face in the process because i was holding a pencil as well. i know it's illegal to play ads louder than the show on tv, so i imagine its similar for music.",0
"Disappointed with platform as far as app goes the ads are exceptionally loud, reminiscent of when FCC intervened with television ads. Also doesn't play the songs selected from groups I follow!",0
super easy to use...great variety of music. I really enjoy it!,1
Khwak Thu Premium,1
Very good app you serach all type of song 1990 to 2222 i love it Thank you so much,1
"I've been a premium subscriber for years. But the app has broken and is unusable. It's been at least 6 months now, and they haven't fixed it. I'll have to cancel now. It's a shame",0
This app is good but I was just listening to ads but then suddenly song started playing. THARE ARE A LOT OF ADS BUT IN THE ADS of this aap you say listen to songs ad freeðŸ¤¥.,0
So it's great but I sort of miss PandÃ·/ra. Spotify is awesome; however it's not life I've ever been to Vietnam. I got phished! Be careful.,1
I gave five stars because this app is amazing......... In it every song was play.......In this app we also have to choose our favourite singer........ This app is good for playing music.......In this app we also have to make our personal song list .......... Thank you.......... So much......... Spotify is best song for playing music............,1
Great venue of music listening ðŸŽ§ Easy to use & navigate.,1
"Ever since the couple of updates, Car Mode has stopped working on my phone. It keeps changing back to the regular player. It's buggy, a song is playing, but on the display it says another song. It freezes while playing.",0
I use it every day. Good listening to music and many genres of music to discover. I love it,1
The lyrics are not visible.,0
"Great idea for music playlists and songs, but I listen to more ads then music. I play 1 song and then get 7 ads back to back that are 30 seconds a piece.",0
"Not sure how you guys manage to have a working, amazing music app, but then manage to completely break it with updates every other year....meanwhile the updates literally add no value to the app...if it ain't broke, don't fix it is a nice concept to revisit. Spotify is amazing, when it works.",0
"I've used spotify for years, and have loved it. However, with the latest update, it no longer works. The music doesn't show up, as if there's nothing on there. I've tried clearing cache, uninstalling, and everything else I can think of. Please fix.",0
I dont like this app coz i am searching a song but when i play the song that time it play another song ðŸ™„,0
"Find loads of new songs, I don't really like how everything is in a playlist tho. I like youtubes play next kinda vibe.",0
Excellent collection super quality easy to use,1
"Joe rogan is the only reason I have Spotify. App pauses randomly, ads always cheat an extra second or two, censorship is no bueno.",0
Great music and podcasts love how they create a playlist based on mood and I love how the don't say no to how many playlists you are able of create,1
"I left Spotify for Tidal a while back, and returned to Spotify a month ago to find it has improved immensely.",1
Can't even subscribe on the app. Very annoying,0
"Useless, absolutely garbage app, seems developers don't care about Android users, tells me I'm not connected even though I have super fast internet, will be switching to youtube music.",0
It's fine except for the fact that I had to watch an ad so I wouldn't get any for 30 mins and after 2 songs I get an ad? Make it make sense please,1
Over 8000+ liked songs here (I have sc not lying here)..soo this is my MAIN music app ðŸ”¥ðŸ¤£ it's soo good no cap,0
I love this app. i can listen to whatever kind of music i want and i love that kind of freedom.,1
Spotify is world's best songs app,1
This app adds songs to my playlist without my permission and we only get 6 skips per hour. And we also need premium to download songs,0
Wow,1
"I love the wide variety of music, the categories, the genres and also my favs are there too. Good app to app listening experience. And one ofy favs from thee rest out there",1
"This app is not user friendly, I've been trying to play just the song I need but other songs I've played before keep playing",0
I love this app cuz I can play the songs that I like but there's one problem the ads is kinda annoying and I can't fine songs cover,0
New update is awful. Cannot see the player anymore and have to physically close the application to stop music. Fix this!,0
"Love that I can download music to my phone for when I'm out of cell service. I also like how my music and podcasts are organized, very easy to use.",1
"There is hardly any music you don't have, and the audio is very clear.",1
"So far I'm not disappointed, in fact, thrilled to find all my music here! ðŸ‘",1
Recently this app isn't working on Airtel network,0
"I get not being able to do some things but some are just ridiculous, heres a list . 1- not being able to choose a song on a playlist 2- not being able to chance the second of the song 3 cant go back to the song before 4 NO QUEUE 5 limited skips 6 CANT REPLAY A SONG??? 6 being stuck with randomizer on 7 WHY DOES IT PLAY RANDOM SONGS BRO THEYRE NOT EVEN ON MY PLAYLIST ???",0
"Good, but on mobile I can only listen to my playlist once and I can't replay my playlist and only lets me listen to recommend.",1
Love it very nice music listening appðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
"Mobile experience is way broken. Switching apps gets rid of the ""currently playing""screen so I have to open and close a few times to get it back. Lately about 30-60 minutes into a podcast it will switch to an ad but glitch partially through the ad, skip to the next episode, mark the last one as finished even if it's only 20% done and then I have to go back and figure out where it cut out... Next episode same thing. Next episode same thing.",0
"This gives me the ability to play any genre of music I choose and I can literally DJ on the go , love it",1
"3 ads per skip is bollocks when the chance of hearing the song you requested is already a 1/5 gamble unless they like what you request. Sepultura, slayer",0
All in all... it's like a one stop music shop! They have EVERYTHING I have ever searched!!,0
"Awesome selection and matching the types of music and artist, definitely my go-to for music. Must have for the music aficionados.",1
Mine is not acting right. I don't have play bar... doesn't connect to my car Bluetooth where I can see what is playing or allow me to skip songs if I want. I can only stop music if I totally turn off phone. Not cool! Please fix!!!,0
Very amazing app there are podcasts also there in app â¤â¤â™¡,1
"Hard to listen to an entire album at one time. It's shuffling between multiple album of the artist. That's what I want. I want to listen to the whole album, not shuffling between 2 or 3 different albums.",1
"Nice music,clear recording good sounds to hear",1
"I really enjoy Spotify, it's the best ever. I plan to update on Spotify this month. I love the oldies music. Thank you for giving all of us such great music to enjoy.",1
Spotify music player good app,1
I have this app for 8 years and counting and I cannot live without it! Spotify accompanies me everywhere I go. Thank you!,1
The spotify has lyrics for almost all the songs except. I love this app. This app also contains various podcast which i love to listen . This app is very nice.,1
Good choice of songs,1
Love it  Just want to give 5 star that all,1
Songs are not downloading to phone memory.,0
I like this. In this u can make playlist listen songs also u can see the lyrics. There are so many songs to hear in one app. I like this the developer did a great job.,1
I wish it was like the ps4 and xbox version like on here you have to shuffle play and if you don't have enough songs in one Playlist it will put songs in they Playlist you don't want its behind a ten dollar a month pay wall ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
I love this music app is sooiiooooo great,1
So far I have only listen to the free subscription. I plan on getting a subscription when thing get better for me. I enjoy the verity that Spotify has and how they make great Playlist out of your choice of artists you chose.,1
App keeps crashing when I press play the play button after the new update. Will change my score once this is fixed. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and it still doesn't fix the issue. Using a Vivo X70 Pro. *Updated review* Issue fixed,0
An extraordinary app if I have to say. But if you haven't subscribed then ads are annoying. But still I love the app. There are a lot of songs I wanted to listen and learn so it's very helpful in many other ways. Thank you.,1
I love it I get to listen to all the podcast that come out with out issues.,1
"It's a really good app , you can listen audios, songs, etc while being on another app at the same time. I had no problem signing in in this device, but then I signed in from another device. I inserted the name, password,email etc and all, but it kept loading forever. The app kept on loading the next day and on and on, it never let me in. It's an annoying glitch and it makes me really disappointed and mad. Fix this glitch soon as possible.",0
"The user interface is terrible and the queue list is the worst thing I've ever seen. I'd download Winamp 1000x before going back to Spotify. What's worst it that it started to play music when the app was closed, and the only way to stop it was to restart my phone.",0
Its a very good song app but it says 30 mins of free listening with no ads but everytine I chose a song and a add plays and it's very revelant,1
"I've been using Spotify for over a decade, would highly recommend. Students get premium for very cheap so make sure if you're a student you take advantage of that!",0
Happy,1
"Littarly love listening to music with my friends here so cool that now there's group sessions and I don't have to be told to skip while listening with them on call lol, great for sitting in the shower while the burning hot water(that's oddly still cold for you) hits your body as you slowly descend to madness thinking abt that embarrassing moment that happened when you where 8.",1
I wish that you could choose whether or not you want spotify to add to your playlists... I personally hate it... I made the playlist with certain songs in it... I don't need more songs added... maybe you could recommend those songs to be added but you just adding them makes my playlists useless and there was no point in me making it if you were just going to change it,0
Really like how I can create a playlist ..,1
"A music app that really struggles to play music. It's never been a great app but recently it has become utter garbage, bugging out and requiring multiple restarts a day, refusing to show downloaded songs when off-line, and a new bug where songs randomly pause for a few seconds then continue, even downloaded ones. Has become such a pain that unless the next update fixes it I will be cancelling my premium account.",0
"Every time I play the sound, for example the song ""tak ingin usai"", when I play the song instead of ""tak ingin usai"" it's another song instead.",0
I mean it's pretty good that's all I have to say lol Although if you already have Amazon prime I suggest you go for prime music Since you know that 1 doesn't have ads that way,1
"Hi spotify, I can't play right song on spptify. When I go to a artist or a playlist I can only preview it.",0
Absolutely my favorite music app,1
"I use this app every day... as of April 9th however, spotify will stop anything I'm listening to. As well as not show anything playing. It'll also restart what I was listening to. Hopefully this can be fixed soon",0
Love Spotify. But version as at 14/04 is problematic. No controls once music starts. Things stop playing by themselves. Also heavier push on ads or sponsored content. Moving in wrong direction.,0
I use Spotify half my day every day at least. I don't think that a day has gone by since 2018 that I haven't used it.,0
It's really hard to find the song you want they are mixed,0
Everything works and sounds great.,1
Best,1
Too manny ads,0
I loaded up Picked up a bunch of Groups Within 5 minutes I was up and running Certainly not like the other app,0
"I listen to music everyday, without fail. Spotify has opened doors to new music and experiences to me. This platform is the only music streaming app you'll need.",1
"In first time, this app is disatified for me. I try to creat account but always reply to me something wrong. Free Log in,Log in with facebook, Log in with google account like that show me but can't sing in. What a uselsss app.",0
I love these app. But can you add feature like listen songs with friends. It will be great if these happen.,1
I'd rate this 5 stars if the driving mode hadn't stopped working. Re-installed and updated to no avail.,0
"Shuffle as default is RIDICULOUS! It does not matter if you touch the big green play button (I know this is a shuffle button, but seriously, shuffle should be user option NOT default) or if you select the first song in your play list. You still need to open the first song and turn shuffle off to play in order. I have invested in PREMIUM service! Extremely frustrating especially in the car!!! Please fix this glitch. This is a big reason for going premium and now it is useless!",0
"(5.23.22)Even after updating yet again it is not loading anything and saying that there is internet issues when im connected to wofi and have data. (4.29.22) It still works on my tablet but not on my phone. (-1 Star) The ad amount fluctuates, which is fine. But the ""30 minutes of ad free listening"" is about 2-3 songs for me then another ad plays. If the app is used consistantly and constantly the ads will become less and less. (-1 Star)",0
"Favorite part of Spotify is being able to follow my friends playlist and being able to make a list with your friends where you can both add music you both like. If you ever throw a party you can have people join by link so that they can add music to the que. Only complaints is that it is best with a subscription, and if you follow a playlist it automatically likes that list which messes up my liked music. Also the AI is dumb as hell, all it does is recommend more songs from artist you like.",0
Nice,1
This is a good app and deserves a 5 star but the 2 ads policy just has me forced to rate a 4,0
Love Spotify. Has everything you would want in a music/podcasts. Easy to use. You really can't go wrong.,1
Smooth experience. Loving it so much,1
"Horrible app. Just a poor version of Pandora. Worst music streaming service by far. No matter what song I choose it doesn't play it, it will play ads for you though instead and something random after that.",0
I love Spotify. It's the best. And I can't live without it. But this recent issue frustrates me a lot. Whenever I play a song from my playlist one song after some other songs starts playing even though shuffle is off. Please look into this and I will come back to give it a 5,1
"Been a user of this app for 4 or 5 years, no problems until latest update, it's logged me out and will not allow me to log back in, can't find which email is linked with my account, no password reset emails received. Been crashing since the update, stop / starting songs, really irritating. I assume my music library has now been lost, hours of my time making playlists wasted. I will be cancelling the direct debit & moving over to amazon music.",0
I enjoy listening to various talented artists. Thank you ðŸ˜Š,1
"Have been facing glitches very recently. The current playing song bar vanishes and the only way to pause or stop music is to kill the app. Also it has not suddenly stopped playing songs intermittently, experience getting from good to bad to worse now.",0
"Great music, available immediately and an amazing choice of artists. Less than 5 stars because there is too many ads. Nevertheless, incredible.",1
"It's ok, my app has recently started playing up. When I leave the app the play list no longer shows up and while the songs are playing it stops and starts. Please fix",0
Song has clear sound to hear and better qlity. But advertisements is length so over tension to hear the song,0
"I haven't been in the business of reviewing apps, but Spotify might be my favorite thing. Only thing I wanna see is a button to shuffle through a folder of playlists like you see on the computer version.",0
Nice app,1
Music is flawless with spotify,1
Songs collection is good really great aap/before i use wynk music/jio savan,1
Outstanding enough for me to move away from Amazon music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ˜Ž,1
"I'll give this a 2 stars for now, I agree with the low rated reviews. I LOVE listening music on Spotify but the problem is it's too restricted! It literally wants u to buy premium,I tried everything but nothing work! I wanted to listen 1 song ONLY but it keeps recommending me other songs that I don't wanna listen to. And I also hate that you can only skip 6 times for an hour!? Fix this problem and hoping there some improvements:/ Y'all really want mobile user's to pay money for some useless prem",0
"I love Spotify, premium is the best, however, I have downloaded playlists that don't keep all the songs in said playlist downloaded. Every time I get a connection of some sort, everything is downloaded again, it makes no sense. Anybody understanding what I'm saying?",0
"im sorry but adding suggested songs right after the playlust and forcing us to listen to them before out actual playlist is stupid. same thing with a verifycation code to report something even if you just didnt like the song, i tried 5 times to report a song cus i didnt like it and it kept telling me that the code it was giving me was incorrect, you should be able to vlock a sound without a verifycation code, you can only skip a song 6 times and you cant go back to listen to song is also stupid.",0
Spotify is the only choice for me it never lets me down and the variety is incredibleðŸ‘,1
Anything is premium ,1
"The ads inside the app seem to impose""so called National language"" even in placed where it's not even a third language. If you can't give your service in regional languages, they why give it? To hear an ad in an unknown language is sh it",0
"Really buggy since last update, the play bar disappears sometimes and I can't pause ny music until force close the app.",0
If you change any settings your going to have to uninstall the app or it will just never work right again,0
"I just want to buy a premium package but it keeps disconnecting me from the website! It happens no matter which package i choose, fix this immediately! Also your ads are trash.",0
"it is easy to get on this app. and alot of music that i like. it works real good, no problems.",1
Too much ads,0
Spotify is the best!,1
"I really like the app, the design is simple and perfect. The Lyrics Funktion is now one of my favorite Features. The Algorithm for made for you is pretty good too. One thing i would add is if you swipe down on a song, i goes back to main page. (Like YouTube when you are on a video.)",1
"I love spotify and I have been using it for years. However, recently there has been a huge increase in glitches and music just wont play smoothly. I have made sure that there is no updates necessary, I really do hope that Spotify manage to sort this out otherwise I will have to rethink my spotify subscription.",1
I enjoy all the podcasts,1
insane,1
"Everytime I first open the app within a 30 minutes window and I play a song, the controller at the bottom doesn't show up. Forces me to close the app and reopen it every single time to troubleshoot. Please fix it.",0
"This app sucks DO NOT DOWNLOAD, ALSO they have this thing where if u like a song and put it in liked songs it will play other songs and u can't do anything about it because it hides the songs in ur playlist.",0
"So the app just recently updated, but now I'm unable to put a song on repeat or shuffle when I play an Playlist mix. I'm only able to put it on repeat if I actually go to the album",0
"Audio quality occasionally drops, sometimes it just stops. Can't control the audio that's being played.",0
Constant crashes. Buggy trash.,0
"A very good app to listen songs , I loved this app @spotify keep it up and grow more â™¥ï¸ ...",1
"I've been on board 4 about 3-4 years. And I think it's amazing. I've really never had a hard time nor has it been a complicated effort in finding music. Being that I'm a lover of music across all genres, this is great. The ability 2 create playlists and share them is amazing. And now, all of the podcasts!! I am a proud premium user.",1
Not even opening on the Samsung S22 Ultra,0
"Restore All JRE Episodes. I was tempted to join Spotify and did download and use the app lightly these last two months, as I wanted to continue listening to podcasts like Science VS. But this whole Joe Rogan Experience debacle has shown how little they care for the 1st amendment.",0
To many ads...,0
Using Spotify for years but got a new phone now when I click into the app it doesn't show any music or podcasts in ANY playlist. Literally everything won't work ..,0
"I am so fed up with spotify right now. I am unable to play anything, when I tap on music I am presented with a black screen. Everything stored on my sd card is deleted. I can't access anything to play. I spent 2 hours on the customer service 'help' chat on Sunday. I lost the link several times, got a different person every time, was given the same advice every time. Nothing has worked! I am now looking at alternatives to spotify. Please sort this out",0
Good content for podcast.,1
"EDIT: I have songs downloaded and it keeps telling me I need internet connection. I redownload the songs and the same thing happens. I have the membership to download the songs, so why am I paying it when I still need connection to listen to the songs. Enjoying all my favorite music. Quick to put new music. Love it",0
"App crashes every all the time. And ad plays, it crashes. You switch to another app and comeback to spotify, app crashes. Always have to restart the app.",0
Good audio quality. Too many ads. I watched a video to get 30 minutes and free and it gave me ads literally a minute later.,0
Very good app for music lover. I haven't seen any major bugs in this app. Excellent podcast and music available.,1
This app is good but the but the fact that Spotify adds songs to my playlist automatically is annoying because there is no point using it if I can't listen to my playlist without rubbish songs getting added to my playlist at least make an option to not automatically add songs then this would be much better,0
Not come up with a song that Spotify don't have. A decent music app,0
"More true to the old peer 2 peer networks. Keep it . Btw, there is no need to be. "" Tied in with everyone!!!!l later.....",1
very good review from me cause you can connect to any device. And you can pick artists to favourite and you cane click on a artist then it will show you a playlist full of there songs.,1
"Original artists, not too much frustrating adverts during music downloads. Enjoy immensely.",1
"the best music library streaming app ever. please DO NOT break it here we are, 2022. it's broken. the lyric engine/algorithm worked, now it's a laugh. lyrics incomplete and wrong...",0
Lots of add interrupting between each song,0
Spotify is amazing it is my top used app on my phone. I always have songs playing. I wish there weren't as many as bc I would like to be able to cry without hearing about the new samsung watch. Thank you.,1
I can't pause the music because now I can't even see the pause or skip buttons. You should work on that.,0
A very nice app. I am going to give four stars because one problem is there in this app that we can't download any song but the app is out standing.,0
Love Spotify but the play bar disappears randomly and doesn't even show up in my task window. Have to force close the app to make the music stop.,0
"I've used spotify for years, it works without issue, and there's loads of brilliant user submitted playlists to choose from. There is ads every so often but you can go ad free, if you prefer. Unlike youtube you can close the screen with your music or podcast playing in the background, which is why its my music app of choice.",0
"Too many issues going on with the app lately that make it horrible to use. Tracks and podcasts will stop playing randomly and will often restart. Extremely annoying having to find the place you were at in a long podcast. The ""fix"" to the issue is to Uninstall and reinstall, but that only works for so long. I have done it myself 5 times now. Giving it a month to be fixed before I end my subscription.",0
Spotify keeps crashing plz fix it otherwise it is a really good app I would recommend it,1
Everything is fine but Equilizer option should near player options but it is in the settings. We need to follow very long path just to enable equilizer. I think that is only wrost part of this app.,0
"Love everything about it! Been on for about 6 years now. No issues till I got my new phone, sure it get corrected! No ads ever!",0
"Very poor excuse of a streaming service. Only recommend if you enjoy endless playback errors, interruptions, and crashes. When reaching out for help the tech team at Spotify will ask you to uninstall and recode their app for them because they can't make a product that works. 0/10 would not recommend.",0
Good way to open yourself up to new artists and fresh sound circulation,1
"(app works great. This rating isn't about the app) 1 star because you keep putting Joe Rogan in my face. Why can't I say ""don't show me this ever again""? If you're going to be so aggressive about podcasts, make it so people who just want to listen to music can do that. I have a podcast reader already.",0
So many ads are there And many other reasons also .,0
Spotify is a best high quality music source,1
I paid for Spotify mini premium but apparently it doesn't work,0
Annoying on laptop it keeps popping up. Brilliant on my phone.,1
I haven't listen or able to listen a single song from this app. Dnt know what the hell with this app. Every time shows the playlist is empty,0
"Leaving reviews on Play is completely useless, but please fix this app. It keeps crashing.",0
"There's a few flaws, but I use this app consistently everyday.",1
I've been a premium user for over 2 years but one thing that really annoys me is that it keeps removing my downloads!!! This is the 6th time it's happening and that really really annoys me. What's the point of being a premium user when I can't even listen to music in offline mode because all my downloads keep on being removed? Spotify fix this!! This app sucks,0
"It's usually a fab app but all of a sudden there seems to be no way to stop music, you can't see thectrack playing either... if you wantbto rewind or fast forward its not possible.... a lil' glitch maybe?",0
This app is good but ads aajata hai bar bar ðŸ¤¨,1
"This is literally the most savage way off forcing people to buy premium. You can not listen to the songs you want (which is literally the whole point of such apps) because it will only shuffle through playlists, giving you 6 free skips until you can't skip songs anymore. On desktop you can do everything you'd expect for FREE! But here they just want to rip you off. Screw this company! Better do something good with your money than spend it on premium for features your media player already has.",0
"If you search a single song, you have to choose a playlist it's put together where the song you want to listen to is 4 songs in. But you can't skip to it because you have limited skips, which was clearly designed with this ""play a bunch of unrelated music first"" to force you into premium. 4 ads that are 15-30 seconds each to listen to 1-2 songs then ads again, even when it tells you get 30 minutes of free listening, it plays ads next song again. So much more that won't fit. Spotify sucks.",0
"I just want to know how 3.5 gigs of cache builds up on an app in a few weeks, when I regularly clear each apps cache through my phones settings. Also start paying musicians more you Cnt",0
Best music app of all timeeee!!!!,1
I love this app because i made songs and my song writing is Aalayla,1
Xlent but rarely it simple shows no internet connection ðŸ¥±,0
it's very good but it's not letting me play a song when I click it it just makes me listen to another and i can't loop it,1
"Mostly Original soundtracks giving wonderful listening experience. Some tracks aren't original soundtrack. One more, autovolume is missing. Some tracks aren't upto the mark. Equaliser provision is also a better feature.",1
"Pretty good selection of pods, music and comedy",1
"Excellent app (as long as you have premium), the only part I believe I that spotify needs to add, is the ability to remove unwanted podcasts from your home recommended page.",1
Spotify use to be good but now it keeps dropping off on all my devices I'm moving to tidal,0
Best platform for streaming music tbh,1
Suddenly very glitchy playing Podcasts. The controls keep disappearing; only way to pause the podcast is to swipe/shut down the app. App turns off when my screen times out and goes dark. I restarted my phone; didn't help.,0
When I try to play a specific song from an artist it just plays something random from them. I would never pay for this because it doesn't work properly. Better off getting YouTube music instead.,0
"A very ðŸ¥° nice app can give you all music you want ,like a buffet.",1
I used to really enjoy Spotify but it's becoming slowly unusable for people who don't have the spare change for premium. You no longer have the 6 skip option and no display AND it pauses the song for pop up visual ads.... disappointing.,0
Everything is alright but being able to control the app from lock screen has disappeared for galaxy s20 fe. I have tried everything the web said and nothing works please fix this as it used to work for my regular s20.,0
"The genre slider widget on the liked song page doesn't slide at all anymore, hiding half the genres from selection.",0
Hardly ever used it so I won't miss it when I remove an app that promotes false health information,1
The Mini player has disappeared so now I can't cast to my devices or skip songs or pause songs without just closing the entire app,0
Too many ads. I know that this is a service with no obligation to be free or to reduce the amount of ads because of a financial interest but there are too many ads. I listen to two songs and there's around 2 minutes of advertising. It makes it very hard to focus especially when I listen to it while studying. I really don't want to splurge on premiere and therfore I'll be looking for another app.,0
I use it daily and absolutely love it!!,1
"I adore Spotify. I would give it a 5 stars, if it weren't for a couple of issues I have with it. For example, the free version is loaded with too many ads, to a point where you hear them more than the songs you are listening to, as well as you can't pick and choose a single song. But this app is amazing. I bought Premium, and I adore it. You can listen to the same playlist as your friends, combine music tastes- and I especially like making my own playlists that last up to 35 hours of music.",1
"2 stars for the app. Spotify is great, but the Android app is super buggy for me. Every once in a while it will just start randomly pausing, or crashing. Its been on going, usually after updates. Sometimes headphone controls no longer work with the app. Their solution is to uninstall and reinstall. It's incredibly frustrating to have to do this like once a month. Spotify is a great service they just really need to tests their new releases more thoroughly. Spotify connect barely ever works as wel",0
"Without primium you cant do anything at all You can only shuffle play wich is fine if it didnt play random ""reccomended songs"" even though you have 100 more songs on your playlist i even turned off that stupid option and it still plays these random songs that i dont even like I JUST WANT TO LISTEN TO MY LIKED SONGS PLAYLIST AND NOT F##ING EMAGINE F##ING DRAGONS A#S APP I CANT EVEN SKIP THE AWFUL ""RECCOMENDED"" SONGS I DONT LIKE im writing this while one of these songs is f%%ing playing",0
"When you pay for premium service and spend months curating playlists just for them to randomly disappear. Much great, such wow..",1
Too much ads,0
"Some songs aren't on Spotify which sucks! Moreover, we can't skip more than 6 times! There shouldn't have been a limit to skipping songs!ðŸ˜’",0
Since I started SPOTIFY my house is filled with all types of pleasant music from morning 'till night. I'm discovering new genres every day. I'd give ten stars if I could. ðŸ’˜,1
"Breaking up often (typically every each 9-10 seconds) skipping 2-3 seconds. Extremely annoying. Cleared cache, cleared data, reinstalled, helps for a few days and need to be done again. Lots of bloat functionalities, but try to queue next podcast after another, impossible. Home menu living its own odd life, favourites as well. Looking at blog nobody is doing anything for ever green bugs, sad.",0
The Worst app if u don't have premium Spotify :/,0
"Spotify has been malfunctioning since the latest update. Songs just stop and continue playing randomly. When I play a video or another audio, Spotify music used to stop automatically but now it continues playing through what I'm watching. The app drop down in the notifications doesn't respond anymore. Have to open the main app to pause or skip track. Sometimes the currently playing song's pop up control doesn't appear so I have to close the entire app to get the music to stop.",0
"Songs keep pausing, missing play menu.... the app is really bad. What the heck happened",0
"I'm sharing a collaborative playlist with my girlfriend. But there is no option to use it only for us two. Consequently random dudes put their stupid songs in the playlist. What the hell is wrong with you, Spotify? Couldn't you see this coming? Give us an option to make collaborative playlists private.",0
"I have recharged for 7 days premium, but I can't able to connect and listen with other premium members,Repeatedly showing only eligible for premium members.",0
"The app is great, nice UI and really good recommendations and mixes. But it's really buggy ( saying it has no internet connection when it has, the ""playing now"" bar disappears really often and sometimes not updating with the current song)",0
Incredible ðŸ˜ƒ is this for music I love ðŸ˜˜ it all time in this app,1
I would have given 5 but unfortunately when you search by artists you only can see 10 of their most searched songs and if you want to explore an artist you have to by album only which is annoying but can search by song as well.,0
A wonderful music experience,1
I've had this app for a long time and I've never had any problems with it,1
"30 mins 1-2 ads (pc), 10 mins 3 ads (android/ios)",0
Great! I just got premium and its so much more helpful so if you're thinking of getting premium; absolutely do! Thanks for working so hard on this app! ðŸ’—ðŸ’•,1
Why did you change it I can't even listen to mi music I liked,0
"why is a song that usually has lyrics, suddenly there are no lyrics?",0
"Love this app. Great library, great sound, very nice and intuitive interface. Tried Tidal and it didn't compare with the User interface. A seamless experience.... Just waiting for the HiFi edition now! ðŸ˜Š",1
"The control panel(where I can see which song us playing or I can pause/play a song) doesn't appear , app is not functional at all like this",0
It's a really nice app for any song i love it there is alot of songs same like YouTube . I like it,1
"Please fix the video feed and sleep timer on the podcasts, as well as the crashing problem. The support functions in the app are unhelpful",0
Terrible app. If you are not constantly using data the app functions like garbage. It's constantly removing downloaded music so when I go to listen off grid it's just not there. Definitely not going to pay for this anymore. Spotify needs to step it up.,0
It could be much better. Will randomly stop playing. Occasionally still recieve ads although I pay for premium. I'm not even mad just disappointed at the wasted potential. Get it together spotify.,0
"Since latest update the app is literally useless unless you pay premium. You cant even listen to the song you search for, instead its shuffled into a playlist of random similar songs and you just have to wait to find it in the selection as skipping songs is now a premium only feature.",0
"love this app, its so useful for when wanting to listen to music, the only problem is the ads and skips but overall, very good app",1
Easy to use and good range of music,1
"Recently introduced bug where sometimes the app won't realise it's playing and won't show the play controls, meaning you cant pause or skip",0
This app consumes high internet but it provides high quality audion and it is too good all the features are okay . It provides no ads between song and lyrics r also god lvl..........,1
I don't want to listen to all out 2010 I want it removed from my playlists,0
"Great at fulfilling its purpose, however as far as updates go the app is literally going two updates forward, one update back. Which is incredibly annoying.",0
"This app literally knows what i want , Even if I forget the songs, This app literally knows the relevancy ,Just don't know the problem, It has very low volume, When compared with YT music, Even the audio quality of YT music is better , May be because of volume may be.",0
So much ad ! After 2 song 2 minute of ad,0
"Amazing user interface, I'm able to listen to my favorite music and podcasts. Awesome app",1
songs are hidden but only in certain playlists and not in others?? I can't unhide them? what is going on. im a premium member and I know that shouldn't be an issue. updated and reinstalled and still not working,0
The new update is incredibly nice and sound quality is good! Spotify Premium is truly worth it. I absolutely recommend Spotify more than other music streaming services. Thank you Spotify! ðŸ˜Š,1
You need to work hard on bug fixes The app tends to lag most of the time Sometimes I've to restart my phone to play music I can't afford premium so what so many ads but I'm still using this app,0
Sometimes if you don't have wifi then you can't here music,0
"I highly recommend Spotify for those that love listening to their favorite music, as well as making their own playlists.",1
My repeat rewind hasn't updated since last may? Idk man just weird At this point i've sunk so much time and money into my spotify that i'll prob never actually leave thoðŸ˜” hope yall fix the duplicates issue before i die and maybe look into the joe rogan antivax podcast episode that sent my coworker down a conspiracy theory rabbit hole,0
"This app is so good and cool i am very interested to this app i loved it so much iam listening every day and night Spotify i am full supporting this app i suggested to try this app and do fun with Spotify and I just say try Spotify try it now and and are you a army , a blink so this app is very good for you armies and blinks and today is very special day for armies this is a army day love you armies love you blinks and i am so happy to this app spotify try Spotif love you Spotify ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜",1
This is nice for hearing songs,1
"The songs, sound quality and the UI are all great....but the ads, the ads were the issue because of which I shifted from gaana....but it started here as well....better than gaana yeah but still to many ads...and just a suggestion, u should add an option to update blends instantly....if the ads are reduced this is the greatest songs app",1
Everything I need in a music app.,0
"Spotify app on Android sometimes the music player control in the app randomly disapear, and if the music was playing then you can't pause it unless you restart the app. It's getting annoying, pls looks into fixing in next update",0
This is trash. I can't even listen to my favorite song it just play a different song.,0
"easy to use, great suggestions and personal playlists",1
Better than jio music. Lesser ads but yes they do promote themselves. And the AI is good of this app.,1
Omg I love this app is much,1
Um can u pls actually play my playlist and not other songs?I can listen to my playlist I've bin skipping songs and it still won't play my playlist. I can't do anything with this app pls come do something about it it's really annoying to play my songs.,0
An exceptional excellent app which has potential to create great history in different applications of musical industry. By improving one of the quality is uninterruptible adds service provision. Thanks. Best of luck for future goals and variable characteristics that would be brought to enhance its genuine authenticity.,1
Nice to lisen any any language one app that is Spotify I will recommended every one,1
Some of my favorite songs are no longer available.,0
Stopped. Not opening. It's so frustrating.,1
Love it. I listen to all my all time favs..,1
Complete trash of an app focused on harvesting data rather than maintaining a functional UI,0
It's the perfect app for listening to music,1
The mobile app plays random stuff when you shuffle an album. It's a totally unrelated genre sometimes,0
There are bugs in this app for the last week. You need to fix them. Paying for premium isn't worth it when the functionality isn't working. Not being able to see what you have queued up is ridiculous. It's sitting in the background playing but not always. Fix it. It's been a week.,0
Not sure I'm really ok with artists not being paid appropriately to access their work. It is very handy though to download playlists to use in the car.,1
One of the most favourite application but now it's the most worst app and I hate it. Always keep saying no internet connection blah blah. No songs play. Why? Very disappointing. Never expect this from this app. It's quite famous and I think popularity makes people blind.,0
NICEE,1
Fantastic app for listening music with network.,1
I love it. All the bands I love in one place. Endless possibilities,1
I enjoyed this very much this is the one of the best things that you can give to the people is what you have to hit let us hear I think it's a wonderful beautiful thing to do for the people will do for me and the people this is an excellent experience this is an excellent thing to do for all of us I recommend this to everyone you guys do good work keep up with the work this is a beautiful experience to listen to what you have to offer us in music and anything God bles and in good health.V.J.D.,1
Completely unusable app. Literally crashes when you attempt to launch it. Don't know why I pay for their service.,0
"Nice quality and quantity, but could have more pocket friendly.",0
Excellent Ai is 10 out of 10,1
I like the way it broadens my horizons with similar music. I I found Spotify through Last FM. Last FM kept dumping me into Spotify. What the heck is scrabbling?! Where is the tutorial. Learning curve wasn't as bad as I thought.,0
"Hi, I just start using it and till now it is great, thanks",1
Love Love love â¤ enjoying ðŸ˜‰ having lyrics amazing how different my versions are from time to time l think I have a awesome play list now fantastic Spotify ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜„ ðŸ‘Œ,1
Alexa listen to all types of music I like and very good app to use for working out.,1
Very good at finding and playing great music.,1
Used to be 5 stars .. now I'm gonna cancel my membership. No play bar shows up when I'm listening to music so literally can't even pause the song I'm on or use the shuffle feature. Now plays one song before bugging out.. Bummer because I used to love spotify,0
Really wonderfull app for listening music.,1
Great just can you put more base to the songs,1
"Recent bugs , including interfearing with the wireless charging on my ford sync 3 , wireless charging works perfectly when using the radio or Sirius satellite, but when I switch to Spotify / Android Auto it will charge for a few minutes and then stop charging and my phone gets hot and the wireless charger pad gets hot",0
Excellent music appication in this world,1
Excellent music streaming platform. Especially with the premium features.,1
Man Spotify's the ðŸ. Great to know that it has put COVID warning in the appropriate episodes of Joe Rogan Podcast. ( ÍÂ° ÍœÊ–Í¡Â°)á•¤,1
Awful music app. Censored and missing tracks. Leave your political ideas out of me trying to enjoy music.,0
I love this app.....we get every new song on the time in Spotify..I enjoy this app a lot..âœŒï¸,1
"This app is great for streaming music, but it's gotten this habit of just closing randomly, even in the mode of a song. I thought this would go away after a month but no, plz fix this",0
Worste app.... There is a long waiting process to login....worst app,0
This app is good I mean it has a lot of songs and is nice and the ads aren't very long really.,1
Where is my enhanced feature gone it was such a good feature,1
Bought premium on the student plan super help and affordable. And them obviously the music range is crazy good since everyone releases songs on here. If you're on the fence about buying the premium version...IT IS WORTH IT.,1
I love Spotify great music and podcast.,1
"Please include the ""Add to Queue"" function to the ""What's New"" section.",0
"Clear, simple, intuitive app.",1
"A good app with one annoying element - on an album, individual track versions are frequently different to the original album. Suspect this is to save storage space by keeping only one version of each song. This doesn't acknowledge though the work that typically goes into crafting an album and it contents by the artists.",0
"Deleted my old review and am replacing it with this one. Anyway. Want a consistent music app that works reliably? Look elsewhere. UI can't stay consistent and performance is always hit or miss. Don't know who, or what, group of people are running the show over at Spotify, but jesus christ, they need to go. Only reason I still use the app is because it has just about any genre and band I could ask for. If it weren't for that, I would have ditched it long ago.",0
I'll give you 5 stars again once you turn your commercials down you have blown two of my speakers because of it fix thus plz,0
Music is great but been having alot of problems with the player itself. Seeming to get stuck and turn off music randomly needing to close the app and open it again to fix. Happens constantly,0
It pops up randomly every time. And also doesn't connect to my cars display like it use to. It also doesn't show the navigation to skip or pause or play a song...,0
"2/15/22 For premium, it's better than other services-- however my issue is that the alphabetical section option isn't permanent as it is a hassle to scroll through my very long playlists when they're not in order when I set the organization to alphabetical, it gets annoying to reorganize them constantly. 5/3/22 Also, the app crashes a lot to the point where I can't play one song without the app crashing & I cannot play or pause music, it doesn't work . I pay for premium, fix this please.",0
Wonderful,1
When I entered my Spotify my account all missed up and no longer showing or allowing me to access the Playlists I made or any artists and my favorite music's. Poor service ðŸ˜¡,0
"Awesome, love this music app",1
Beautiful lullabye songs for babies and should add some more,1
"They make you jump through hoops to cancel!! You can subscribe to Premium on the app, but you can't unsubscribe from it. To unsubscribe, you have to log onto their site, except they won't accept your password (I know it's right, I wrote it down), then they won't send you password reset emails after MANY requests. If you value peace of mind, use a different app",0
"Would give no star's if I could, so many recommendations of podcasts and rubbish. So hard to navigate and no new music options (eventually found it hidden) ...If you like music then try something else (I signed up to 3 month trial but couldnt even last 3 weeks on Spotify)",0
"Infact this is the best streaming app so far, I love everything about this app. Am just in love with this app. But is it possible to buy songs and albums from Spotify I don't mind paying huge amount of money. I just love this app and everything about them, it so wonderful and a very loving app to have on your cell phones. Love you SPOTIFY.",1
"Really good, especially when using premium. Only complaint is that some songs cannot be found and it's understood that; that is the artist's choice.",1
I had it for two days ..... The app froze twice .... And in the last day it just ate my battery even when the app was closed .... Whent from 100 % to 5 % in 3 hours with no screen time... I only use the app for like 30mins ..... Uninstalled it and the phone is back to normal,0
"This app is great for listening to music don't get me wrong, but it's annoying to put up with ads",0
Consistent errors with content and playlists not available coupled with disastrous customer support.,0
"Currently virtually unusable... can't search for anything (endless loading, no results). Super slow and laggy, yet it's fully updated and I've tried restarting my phone. Update: And now I can't even go away from the app and come back with the app working. I literally have to restart my phone every time I leave the app and then want to go back to it. This is ridiculous! I pay for premium and this is not even close to reasonable.",0
Very easy to find any song you like no matter how old it is,0
This is the best app by far i learned more of woodworking through this app than i wouldve anywhere else I redid all my kitchen cabinets thanks to spotify,1
Honestly so much better then youtube music and that's enough for me,1
Every month there are more and more ads. Used to not be unnoticeable but now is annoying.,0
It's amazing but took me a second to learn how to use most features,0
"The app is good, but the ads are a real pain. I understand you have to run adds, but you should at least consider my preferences when running ads. I listen to quiet, calming music during my work, and the ads are often for songs that I would never, ever listen to, and they tend to be quite disruptive. I can't work with that. Unfortunately it didn't work for me.",0
"Just switched to napster and I already like it better - and I know they pay the artists more too! Spotify is missing some basic features (custom audio leveling, etc...) and beside that, I cannot support someone who pays Joe Rogan millions - yuck! Wish I'd left long ago!",0
3 min ad for non premium user. Youtube music is better,0
I mean sum times it won't let me play songs off my playlist but it good,1
"Excellent service even very old songs,highly recommended",1
I like Spotify and all but fix your shuffle program. If I have 100 songs on a play list and hit shuffle. I don't want it to shuffle just 30 of those songs I want it to shuffle all of them. Getting irritating hearing the same songs being shuffled all day,0
"can always find what im wanting to listen to, makes road trips a little easier when im travelling in remote areas",1
nakaka tanggal ng stress,1
"Keeps putting songs I've hidden in my suggested songs when I listen to my liked songs play list. I don't like these songs, they're completely different from what I listen to and just don't understand why it keeps putting them on, literally only when I've run out of skips, and I'm not going to get premium because the artists don't get paid nearly enough for their music to be on this app.",0
"It's unfortunate theyre so popular because my grandma (who had trouble printing thing from her computer) could make a better working, more reliable and coherent app then these absolute braindead people who work for spotify.... absolutely embarrassly broken app.",0
I downloaded Spotify for The Joe Rogan Experience but the music is great too! Thank you Spotify for sticking by Mr Rogan and his fantastic show!,1
user friendly,1
I like the app I've had it for over 5 years but lately there have been 10-15 adds at once when it used to be 1-3 adds I am getting tired of this please devs do something about this,0
"Cant pick what you want, Forces songs you dont want on playlists, Etc... It's very bad",0
"This was an amazing app. It's still great for standard stuff but the thing I love most only works part of the time. And that is frustrating. Trying to get a group session started is almost impossible and tonight it is, it will not load no matter how many times we uninstall and reinstall. The group session bugs need to be fixed.",0
"My kinda music anywhere I go! Not just any ol music but my customized list with suggestions based on my fav musicians, takes this to next level! This app is so very cool!",1
This app was doing great but suddenly all my liked songs disappeared and the next day I had no account on Spotify. After re-download and paying for premium for my phone it even asks for other devices having the same acc. I'm not gonna paying so much for just freaking adds.,0
It always shows no internet connection available even if I am connected on Wi-Fi,0
I wish the option to hold a song to preview it was available.,0
This app is a complete rip off now they play 3 ads per song worse than a fucÃ·ing radio. Do not waste your time downloading this,0
NICE,1
A platform that profits from peddling non-science and anti-fact podcasts. Avoid.,0
Just the best music streaming platform out there.,1
What music App! Can't live without it anymore ðŸ˜€,0
Spotify just got rid of one of its best features - the ability to preview songs you're looking up/adding to a playlist. ðŸ˜•,0
"I've found music that I haven't heard since I was in high school, really good for helping with music your not sure what the name is. Just a really Good place to Listen to your Tunes!âœŒðŸ’“",1
"There's a lot of ads now, even if it says ' Enjoy the next 30 minutes of uninterupted listening ' almost two 3-4 minute songs later and there's ads. I also hate the fact that I can loop on my laptop yet not on my phone and that on mobe it automaticly adds songs if it's a short playlist.",0
One of the top music apps What I liked most is the subscription very affordable considering the quality of the music,1
This app is good I play all song without ads but i buy the premium membership,1
"I love Spotify but I noticed a bug: when I lock my phone, the podcast player will appear on the lockscreen with the correct podcast episode and info, but the photo is from the last podcast I watched. It's a little confusing at times. Seems like a simple code fix.",0
"Working very poorly lately, very buggy, especially with Android auto",0
"App breaking bug forces a 1 start review. App auto starts by itself at random, and no way to disable according to a developer post from oct2021,horrendous design, the programmers should be ashamed of themselves.",0
"Too many add for a free account even! Other musical apps which offer free listening and streaming does not have so many adds. You should have not kept the option of a free app if you wont even let people' listen to 2 songs at a stretch. Also the prices are too high for prem accounts. Nobody's gonna buy when there are better options like wynk, amazon music",0
I took the premium but still I can't download and the episode can't be downloaded but it says u can but it's all fake ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜¡ðŸ’©ðŸ’©,0
Best app for anything audio.,1
It's a amazing website that you can listen to music on and the ads aren't as bothersome,1
The app isn't that bad however to access to cancel a subscription is a process when on a Android device.,0
"Love it!!Go Spotify,not canceling my subscription",1
Lots of adds. Ruins all the mood of listening music.,0
My Constant Music App I use this every day for my Taxi job all the time.,0
"Add an equalizer please. Trash interface. Add to playlist should be a two tap operation! It takes 3 taps and one scroll currently and all them are extremely slow to open. And why does the layout keep changing based on where I start playing? The like button is sometimes on the right otherwise on bottom left, very annoying. Good collection of songs otherwise a very sub-par app.",0
Very good experience with every podcast that I come across with! The podcasts that I have on my Spotify can also be seen on my blog.,1
IT Does but play all songs! Only a PC with a web browser will!!! The SPOTIFY APP FOR ANDROID SUCKS!!,0
Just in the process of cancelling subscription. I'm not giving money to something that hosts conspiracy anti-vax stuff. Spotify has completely lost their way. Don't worry about losing playlists as there are programmes out there which let you transfer them (tune my music is easy to use). Come on don't sign up to this lot!! Loads of other apps have the same catalogue.,0
The app sometimes plays the wrong songs when I try to listen to my Playlists and it goes on for a while...,0
"I m listening songs on Spotify since last 2 years and i love it. It has a songs from millions of catagory, albums,artist and many more but my request is plz bring that song also which is not popular more.bring that artist also",1
This app is awesome I just loved it â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸ and we can listen any languages music ðŸŽµðŸŽµ,1
"Edit 04/2022: the app is crashing every 15min, stopping the songs suddenly, not displaying the music player anymore... Maybe you should fix your app for good before giving millions to FC Barcelona... I love Spotify but for a few weeks now it has some bugs and the shuffling is pretty bad, I often get 2 times the same song within 2 hours of listening a playlist with 800 songs... Please fix that it was fine before and it's quite annoying now",0
I am giving it a 1 star Bec when the free month ends it becomes the worst app ever it doesn't let me choose to play a song it makes me play it for a very short time and it is too expensive,0
"I have been using Spotify for a while now, but today suddenly, it stopped connecting to my Internet, all my other apps are working except Spotify. Pls fix this and you get 5 stars.",0
keeps cutting out -takes sweet-a**time loading,0
Needs landscape view back. Its doesnt work in some screens.,0
you can find most of anything you're looking for I like it,1
Hi I am not sure how to do somethings but I really like the app it's a good little appðŸ‘ðŸ˜€ that is the inspection I have had befor at lest l hope that's the case this time of course ðŸ‘â¤ï¸,1
I love this app this app have all songs and also my favourite songs really i love this app and mere ghar pe meri puri family ke phone me spotify download hey and ye app mujhe bahut pasand he,1
"why bother? too many ads, most good versions of songs are unavailable, or even just im general i cant find the good stuff here. feels like a cheap knockoff version of another app that actually does its job well",0
love all the music but too much adds without premium,0
Latest release have been a disaster. Please revert to previous release while you fix all the issues.,0
"I have a great experience using your app, clear sound remembers to download and keeps downloaded sounds. Great one",1
"just downloaded the app. it's not playing the song I want. I make a playlist and it's playing a ""suggested song"" and won't let me skip.",1
"The current UI needs work. There's certain elements that work better even in the Lite version, such as album sorting. Create an option to stop being forced upon random podcasts - maybe a seperate tab. Thanks for adding lyrics +1*. Downloaded playlists and albums get deleted often. Maybe add some optional listening stats. It's a good app, there has been some improvements over the past few months but these frustrations are off-putting.",0
It's great I personally love Spotify.,1
"Spotify with permium is something everyone needs even if they dont listen to music daily, even without premium spotify is one of if not the best place to get your music",1
I love this app but I have one problem that seems to happen more often than not where the app completey stops working like won't play songs but will load the menu and say it's playing but isn't playing anything and won't load my liked songs. It's extremely frustrating,0
"I can't turn the ads off even though I pay for their service (""sponsored suggestions"" are just ads by another name, and they put sponsored music in your Discover Weekly playlist) and the app won't stop heckling me to give it bluetooth permissions every time I open the app, even though my headphones work completely fine without Spotify having Bluetooth permissions.",1
Very good for listening songs and i love to play background music .ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž,1
I like it because I get to listen to music while my phone is off. But who's idea was it to add like 10 advertisements in a rowm,0
No longer working with Android Auto,0
"Great app. Was hesitant at first, but the JRE brought me here. Please continue to be against censorship and continue the great work.",1
"The app now is really money-driven, I've been using the app for years but it recently got so much worse. Now I can't even listen to snippet of a song before adding it to my playlist, the adds sucks and just simply annoying. They can't add anymore features so now they restrict us from enjoying the basic features like skipping songs.",0
Spotify is one of the good app for listening music.. But suggestion of the next song is not based on my previous/similar intrest.. Hence you have to work on the Artificial Intelligence & Machine learning so that similar songs can be suggested to the music lovers.. Just check on the YouTube how they are suggesting the similar songs..,0
"Spotify seems to think they are the gate keepers of what we can listen to. I only joined Spotify to listen to Joe Rogan but I'm close to uninstalling it. Restore Joe Rogan's content & stop acting like you can control what we listen to. If you want this review to change, restore Rogan's content.",0
Only downloaded it to listen to the Fair Enough podcast and can't even listen to a whole episode because Spotify crashes 7 seconds in and won't launch again for hours. Wish they'd fix this.,0
"I love spotify! You can listen to millions of fantastic music, sing along and more! The only thing I do not like about it is because when I tap on a song to play, theres about 4 or 5 ads and they are always about 30 seconds, spotify, I really like your app but may you take away some ads??",1
"Latest update broke it entirely. Plays on phone. Plays on computer. Even let's Google connect to it. But decided to no longer connect to my car. Now I have to go to the generic Bluetooth audio setting and it sounds worse, and has less controls",0
Having issues with downloads. Seems like the downloading is lagging and not downloading at all. Read 0 out of 32 downloading but won't progress to completing the downloads. Considering deleting and reinstalling app.,0
"its a really good app, but its just that when i try to find a song it only is as a playtist and i skip songs from that playtist till i get 3 ads and realizing that the song isnt even in the playtist, and the playtist i created it automatically adds random songs",0
Spotify is not the app is literally like when you click to play your playlist it's not like how it used to be now just generates on some random song and it's not fun I can't start from the beginning and it limits how many songs you can swipe you can only do six per hour why Spotify tell me cuz this is not making sense like I downloaded this app to listen to music but now I can't and I don't like the app anymore that's why I give the one star cuz of this Spotify needs to update their pictures,0
good app for ads,1
"Many years already, also they helped me out with a hack that subscribed to premium when I lived in a country with no spotify.",0
Nah you guys are bad I went to play some of my liked songs and it gave me something else songs I don't even know. I just wanna listen to my favorite song.,0
"Really very super application for hearing songs, love it so muchðŸ˜ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜",1
Cool,1
"Over the last few years, the app just seems to get more buggy as more features were added. If you use Android Auto, look for a better, less buggy service. Audio catalog is still great.",1
"I'm about to unsubscribe and go back to the app I used to use. As frustrating as that one was, Spotify is somehow worse. It has been doing more and more strange and nonsensical things that I think are related to ""Spotify Connect"". I use Spotify on several different devices, but not at the same time, yet the device I'm currently using at any given time just doesn't seem to know what's going on. Please give us the option to disable Spotify Connect on our account. I don't care about it at all.",0
"Pay for nothing but bugs and a service that won't work. Unless I hit shuffle play I cannot click on songs in my library and then actually play, insteadThe app just freezes.",0
It has a lot of songs it is really forth being downloaded,1
The bar to skip or pause music keeps disappearing,0
"I have the premium version, I like it but when I'm conecting my JBL speaker the sound is interrupted and it's not great sounding",0
"Great app, the free version is great. I do have premuim, but with the free version you can still do lots of things. Premuim lets you download and have no ads, (top two things of premuim.) But, you still don't need premuim, I got it as a gift. Spotify overall: 5 stars for me!",1
Best app ever to post your podcast and find new content.,1
Cannot update my premium. It always try to connect evn tho there is nothing wrong with the network.,1
"Genuinely love this app. Want to give it 5 stars. But it's just that the auto play isn't as good as YouTube music. It repeats the song if I search for something and play it. Apart from that, even algorithm for playlist creation is awesome.",0
Slow to the point of being unusable. No other music app causes my phone to lag like this. Thats not even starting on the occasional ads that display on startup with a paid account.,0
"You can find any music, very good quality!! Love it",1
"PLEASE remove the ""we added these songs to your playlist"" feature, it's absolutely annoying. I want to play some songs on my playlist then suddenly a song im unfamilliar with comes in, like I only wanted to listen to songs in my playlist, not some random sings that I have never even heard of.",0
"Two major things. The premium app is supposed allow for music offline via downloaded music. Yet the app is almost unusable when offline as things still seem to require the internet to function. Also, the play completely disappears now. Why?",0
Too much of ads,0
I really like this app but when i have shuffle on that means i want it to shuffle all the songs not listen to 10 out of 967 songs over and over again. Please fix this.,0
"App Constantly stops playing the music for no reason meaning I have to open the phone up which miraculously starts the music playing again, I pay for a premium account and to be honest I am very disappointed in the service I get.",0
Very good! I like to get to know new artists an music styles and the proposed themes help a lot!,1
"Pretty good, the premium features are awesome, but the regular version can be kind of annoying. It's good though.",0
"Its better than wynk or gaana , it has the best playlist",1
Why i cn Not open my acc in spotify i cnnot log in plss fix this,0
Uninstalling.. App Does what it wants plays their own playlists instead of mine frequently. Barely pays artists yet pays Podcasters who use racial slurs 100mil plus. There are better free platforms out there. That dont exploit like this. Power to the artists.,0
The app isn't working at the moment properly,0
"Whatever they have done to this app is terrible. I can no longer control the songs from my car without using my phone. When I get out of the car, the music continues to just play from my phone. I don't know what you've done, but it's not good. It used to be easily one of the best user friendly apps.",0
I really like this app but I have one problem....when I make my own playlist that doesn't have a lot of song only 6-7 like that this app will add another song that I don't like and I doesn't even know those song...I hope you can stop that...,0
it is good but Soo much ads,1
"I love spotify, it's just lately there have been bugs that has made it almost impossible to enjoy the app. if I wanted a specific category, for an example, metal. if I wanted to listen to only that genre, it will skip my request and play pop, or something that I didn't even have on my Playlist. Also, I would have to add a suggestion. you should add a feature to organize your music either by genre or custom. it would make it a lot easier to manage and find what you're looking for.",0
Best app for music listening,1
"App had always been great until the last few weeks where music keeps randomly stopping and I can no longer see player controls, both on the app or lockscreen so can no longer skip songs/see what I'm listening to. Have tried reinstalling the app and can't find anywhere to file a report either.",0
This app is very amazingðŸ¤©. Whenever I am bored I listen songs from this app. I just love this app,1
"Litterally horrible. If you're broke, or just don't want to pay for premium, it plays either twelve ads in a row on some days, and three ads after every song on other days. Not to mention how if you have a large playlist it'll only rotate around the same ten songs over and over again. Would never recommend",0
I love how it personalized a Playlist for me.,1
"No need to carry cassettes, CD's or pendrive Simply on the Spotify app & lisent to your favourite music, Fantastic.",0
Overall the app is good but the ads sucks. Seriously too many ads after every 2 to 3 song. Please fix it. And please add some stories podcasts like pocket fm most of the people really like stories audio so please add some in spotify just like pocket fm plz requesting to you.,0
Love it so easy to do and you can hide songs that you don't like.love it,1
Removal of functions including repeating albums and playlists especially after paying for a subscription has only made the service worst.,0
"The app wouldn't play the songs in MY playlist it would add songs and it's annoying, don't recommend tbh.",0
Constantly pauses playback...trash. its 2022 streaming is nothing new there is zero reason for any bs,0
Im paying for Spotify premium but it is not delivered! No live customer support!! They also delete my downloads and then I have to download them all again!! Very disappointed. Going with YouTube music now. Spotify doesn't care about its customers...,0
"EDIT: Lowering the score. Apparently Spotify allows added local ads on Podcasts even on PREMIUM. I'm paying extra NOT to listen to the ads! I listen to podcasts to learn something, not to have a local supermarket ad playing. With this higher-pitch ad'sy voice. Makes me want to puke, honestly! They admitted it on Spotify community forum and explained it in a corpo-bullsh... way. Disgusting. I've been a Premium user for few years, veeeery tempted just to move on another paid platform, no ads",0
I love using spotify one day YouTube wasn't working so my friends said try spotify so I did and I thank them a lot!,1
It's a great app if I must say easy to use and very specific,1
highly recommend this app for music lovers â¤â¤â¤ In the total Play Store...i Love Spotify in All â¤ðŸ‘ðŸ»,1
"The basic control bar from the app has dissapeared. Using Samsung Galaxy 10. I uninstalled reinstalled, restarted my phone. Still happening. You would think by 2022 Spotify would have at least the control bar functional. Its even cutting out completely for no reason. PLEASE FIX",0
"Without premium this app is worthless, you get restricted to 6 skips an hour and can't eaven select the songs you want to listen to. Plus you get ads about premium every five seconds and they automatically add songs to your playlist that you can't get rid of. Restricted functions unless you buy premium, premium would be 4 stars as well because yt music does the same for free.",0
Please stop recommending podcasts; I don't listen to them and Joe Rogan is a complete tool.,0
I love Spotify - I say it again - I love Spotify - if I could sing it I would sing - I LOVE SPOTIFY!,1
"I get you guys are desperate for premium subscribers or whatever, but what's with ALL the ads? Other than that, I guess Spotify is aight,,",0
Nice app,1
good app for listening to music but thats only if u buy premium. without premium they add songs to ur playlists and they dont even let u play songs unless its in a playlist which is completely unnecessary.,0
"Shuffle play is the worst shuffle play I've ever seen..... I have about 1200 liked songs but it plays only few of them and I can hear twice a song in an half of hour. Please fix this, it's really annoying.",0
"Great content, vast selection, something for everyone. If you don't like something find another channel.",1
"Ads are part of the experience. Using the ""free"" subscription, so ads are understandable. I am tired of hearing the same three ads on every break. Would probably help if they were relevant to my location too. Spotify itself? Good service, better than radio, and listening to ads is the price we pay",0
Beautiful interface superior sound quality Absolutely love it,1
Got to fix ur premium cause i can't listen to music offline,0
Still garbage. If I wasn't so deep into creating my library using Spotify I would use a different app. Constantly have to redownload everything for absolutely no discernable reason. App closed and reopened? Guess you're downloading your entire library for the third time this week.,0
"It was great when I first got it, now it won't download podcasts and it constantly causes bluetooth to crash",0
"Amazing. I love it so much, it's very good quality. It has all the songs I like. Don't really have that much to say except for it's a really amazing app.",1
U can find any song here. Playlists are beautifully framed,1
I love this app I would recommend this 10 out of 10 to anybody. I don't even have premium and I don't get ads that much and Spotify is just really good.,1
Sometimes it is amazing but I can't see the songs on a playlist by another artist or It randomizes the music to some dumb song completely unrelated to the music I'm listening to and sometimes I just want to delete the app.,0
It is a good app .But i cant see the lyrics coming.that is my only complain..,1
"Nice sound, nice app",1
I really like Spotify. Easy to use. Can find most artists.,1
"Ok, app Is fine, whatever, but whenever I open an MP3 it always opens with Spotify. I looked at every help forum I could find, but the only way I found to stop it from opening my MP3s is to uninstall the app. I don't want to.",0
"EDITING THIS ON 01/27/22 TO SAY THIS GARBAGE APP REALLY CHOSE JOE ROGAN OVER NEIL YOUNG?!?!?! GET BENT SPOTIFY. Worst app on the market. Doesn't matter if you pay for premium. The app will close randomly. It will end your podcast in the middle of listening and say the whole thing is played, not saving your spot. If the podcast has ads the whole app will close instead of playing the ads. This app needs an entire overhaul by someone who actually knows how to build a proper player app.",0
Awesome app. Just reduce the number of adsðŸ˜„,0
"May switch to another service, have used spotify for years and it has been mostly a good streaming service. Until now, errors like: songs randomly not playing while on wifi or in good service, songs missing from my liked songs, at times you occasionally go to like a song and the heart doesn't light up so you're not sure if it's liked or not, additionally the sorting of Playlist is and always has been clunky. Right now it's streaming from phone to TV and playing but won't play on phone itself",0
Best music app ever made.,1
Very happy with the selection of music everything you could ever want in a music app â˜ºï¸,1
You know,1
"sometimes it's take time for loading , By the way it's Nice app ðŸ‘ðŸ»",1
Not got an issue really got everything im looking for only down side would be the price for multiple accounts,0
I want to play only a single song but I guess I have to pay for that,0
the play bar at the bottom of the app keeps disappearing. can't see what's playing or pause/ play/skip without closing the app completely over and over until it works again.,0
"I love Spotify because my musical taste is rather eclectic and I can find it all on Spotify, from Gregorian chant to folk to modern pop music. I am truly amazed! I also lsten to several podcasts and I can listen to them on Spotify too. My kids talked me into it and I am so glad that I have the app!",1
Why is Spotify stopping and starting all the time now can't skip songs its so buggy not sure why I am paying for this buggy app I can't get more than 20 sec with out it bugging out and stopping to play the song I am playing,0
"While I hear the premium version is good, the free version is really buggy for music. Specifically regarding the ads they use to support it. I've been using this on and off for years and I always have to stop after a few weeks, because of a bug that causes an advertisement to play on loop until the next update(which only stops the problem for roughly 2 weeks before it starts again). I've also reduced its score because of how poorly it compensates creators",0
"Great music selection and excellent algorithms to suggest music you might like. Lately has been very buggy though, unfortunately. Several issues relating to the play queue, liking / unliking songs, and especially syncing with my google home devices, and other devices like my Bluetooth headset. Please fix these, they are really frustrating!",0
I really like Spotify but the only reason i gave it a 1 star is bc of all the ads i got 16 ads after i finished listening 1 song,0
"worst app in existence, would give -100000000000000 stars if i could, every employee please kys",0
"Spotify has a lot more to it than just listening, I rather enjoyed the many options I had, the playlist was user friendly, I'd recommend Spotify for your go to music station.",1
"Love it, though I wish the ads weren't so long, I'm too lazy to buy something to remove them, and they aren't that bad.",1
Spotify is the bomb digady. I love it.,1
Why don't you just play ads instead of songs?,0
Music quality great love to listen every day,1
Fun and fast both nastalgic and Inlightning with recommendations.,1
"This music company js absolutely disgusting. Not only can't you play the song you want if you don't have premium, but it also has ads. Absolutely horrible and definetly not worth it without premium.",0
Hey The app is pretty good but there are no lyrics coming on my account please check this issue,0
"I love Spotify but omg you should let us see what profiles follow our playlists! I beg of you it would be so cool ðŸ˜­ I'd rate it 5 stars then, other than that Spotify is great",1
After discovering Spotify several years ago I wouldn't recommend any other music app or website to use ever again. It's affordable usually non-issue and has everything ever made it seems. Love all the costuming options available to personalize ever little bit of your account to fit your personal taste,1
Its very easy to use and love the end of the year thing,1
Amazing app to play music,1
"Everything is so good on premium. Sometimes it just doesn't want to play the song already playing after reopening the app, not a big issue at all. Premium was a good idea to get.",0
I love Spotify BUT the player controls that allow me to fast forward and rewind fails frequently.,0
"Drain my cellphone battery fast, playing music all of the sudden with out knowing, that's totally very annoying especially in the middle of the sleeping time at night.",0
Am going the app the only thing I have problem with they're don't help option,0
Best music app ever! You'll find all the music you want here! ðŸ¤©,1
It helps me focus,1
Not able to pause or play after a certain time,0
"I liked this app but I gave 4 stars because I am just getting started,I am really appreciated that Spotify has very less ad the best thing the sounds are very clear...and actually I am a music lover I love to sing and listen song ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ so that so also a reason I loved this app and it has all the songs like Hindi, English,Korean ,etc...... tried many apps and this app is the best among thoseðŸ˜ðŸ˜",1
So many add makes disturbence while listening..,1
"""Enjoy the next 30 minutes of ad-free listening."" Time to next ad: 15.5 minutes. This is a small issue, but it errodes my trust in your brand and contributes to my hesitation about getting a premium subscription.",0
"Constantly stopped playing randomly or plays but shows on the app that it isn't playing causing me not to ve able to pause or fast fwd, etc...",0
I like it how this loading screen simulator sometimes plays music. Pretty cool feature. Especially like how realistic it is with how slow it's loading in its servers and always has to check if you're a filthy thief or not. It gets especially like this when you pay a monthly subscription for it.,1
It's a great listening app plays songs according to your likes and they give you a 30 min add free music intro. So you can enjoy as a first time listener.,1
the app updates keeps on crashing...,0
Its so good and cool...But I want to listen to it for free without using the internet.,1
"Love it. Best app for discovering music, making Playlists and listening to the podcasts I enjoy. Enjoying my premium account, never going back. Definitely worth the money.",1
Great,1
"Only platform I would wanna subscribe to if it was just a little bit less, monthly.",0
"So far it's very good. Of course the ads on Spotify lite are most annoying. Really? I completely understand the need for commercial endorsements however you might consider your placement practices. I could offer advice given my lengthy experience in tracking media, not as a professional but as an erstwhile private citizen. You are an excellent service,but the one issue is considerable.",1
Interesting streaming app.. quality Audio n less data spent while streaming..fell in love with since d inception of me downloading d app to my phone.excellent performance.love it.ðŸ’“ðŸ˜ðŸŒ¹ðŸ’“,1
"Excellent platform if you want to educate yourself and learn , even about what the tech dynasty and their tyrants spend incredible time hiding from the public.",1
"Great app, makes life happier.",1
"Started good but ads took over, that & is inconsistent. Sometimes will go back, most times will not. And you try to play an artist & may get a couple from them, then it go's to other artists, who are not very similar...",0
Great way to listen to music but I clearly turned of auto play ( playing songs that aren't in my playlist after it's done) and yet it still plays song that I CLEARY do not have on my playlist. This frustrates me because I can not reset my playlist so I have to play a different playlist then play that playlist so I can go back to MY songs,0
"We have had spotify for 2 years now, and at first, it was great, but lately, I'm having to restart my phone, so this ap will play music. Like twice daily, I'm doing this; it doesn't matter if it is a podcast or music the same result. It's frustrating enough to consider going to Amazon....... Unless it's fixed, that's the way we will be taking. I",0
Amazing... I love the audio quality and the songs mostly all songs I found here.... But there is so much adds too but it's ok it's a good experience ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€,1
Just better with premium. (Less annoying),1
It's a great app but it doesn't work without WiFi or it doesn't work fast but it'll get 5 stars â­â­â­â­â­ but I think it needs to work without WiFi bc I do like apps that work without WiFi/Games without WiFi anyways that's my report if it doesn't update I'm deleting it I really I'm not trying to be mean to the person who made it but this really is needing to be updated for real (â–€Ì¿Ä¹Ì¯â–€Ì¿ Ì¿)á¶ áµ’Ê³ Ê³áµ‰áµƒË¡ kk byee,0
"I'm a man of few words. I think Spotify for me personally meets ALL of my expectations, you should give it a try.",1
"SPOTIFY just Stopped working suddenly, please respond Asap, thanks.tell",0
The greatest music App Ever created wow!,1
"Much easier for me to deal with some of the other streaming services; however, I do like the ease of accessing the songs I'm looking for and setting up Playlists.",1
For me this is the best music and podcast Player out there I enjoy every bit of this app nice one Spotify,1
Better the any other music platform such as SoundCloud pandora and sometimes YouTube,0
Very buggy lately. Not playing liked songs and not connecting properly to amazon echo alexa. It used to seamlessly before. Not worth the premium subscription so I'll cancel and go elsewhere. Not even worth using as a free version at the moment.,0
"This app crashes several times a day and when an ad plays during a podcast it resets it back to the beginning.. honestly not sure what's happened to the developers of this app, have they been replaced by toddler's? Update after a year: still very very bad, none of the the problems stated here have been resolved.",0
Love that I can download the music I love!So easy to use!!!,1
"Best app experience, the UI is very simple & easy to use. The app runs smooth at all times & up to this far I haven't experienced any glitches.",0
"Really only good if you have money Listen, it's a good app when you actually have money. I'll give it that. But when you're unable to pay for a subscription things can get absolutely terrible. I'd be fine with like maybe an ad or two but no, free removes basically everything good about the app. It's terrible, like literally your strategy is making people so mad with the fre version they buy what the actual app should be without money. I'm legitimately considering changing music apps cuz of this",0
It's was good to listen music...and adds coming on every 30 minutes..now a days I got an update on last month and it's too forcing to buy premium every 2 songs minimum 3 adds coming.. it's not far..... it's too irritating....,0
"It's unfortunate that i used to love Spotify until the latest shuffle update which I find it unreasonable. I cannot even play the songs I want, I think it's unthinkable.",0
Spotify is working flawlessly now Its a great app to listen to music and its environment is also far better than others Like it literally have apps for every ui like windows macos linux I have already used youtube music hungama gaana apple music But I have to say user experience in Spotify is far better than these platform One thing where Spotify lags is the user recommendation Youtube music is best for the user recommendation But music quality wise apple music is best,1
"Everytime I update my payment there is this message: ""oops something went wrong"" error.. I can't update my premium because of this... pls fix it",0
i cant play any song that i want you better fix it to have 5 stars from me,0
Such a best music experience but there are lots of ads,0
Unable to dismiss the advertisements .. fix it,1
"the UI of this app (at least on the phone, which is where I use it the most) is very unintuitive. Where is the ability to select multiple songs in a playlist to perform bulk operations on them (remove, add to other playlist, like, etc.)? This alone would go a long way to make the app more user friendly. As it is right now, it's just a pain to use whenever I need to make bigger changes to my playlists.",0
"I still dont have the update where I can see the songs lyrics, what do I do?",0
Alright. The app is 5 stars but my account got hacked and I had premium for over 6 months now and spend my monthly pocket money on it. I had logins from Ukraine and USA while I am in Poland. I have updated my password do a stronger one and logged out of all devices. Please update security measures as I use the app everyday without complain. The three devices I had it on was a huwawei p 30 pro and lite and an asus rtx 2060 super laptop. PLEASE HELP :(,0
Love this app but when I click on a song it takes me too a completely different one so I can't listen to the sound I want to,0
Very good.My child plays calm music everybody.It even makes me calm.I love it.ðŸ˜ðŸ˜€ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜ª,1
Great platform to enjoy music and podcasts.,1
"Spotify unreliable on SGN9. Music randomly stopping since update 5/4/22, and Play / Pause / Skip bar at bottom of app screen keeps disappearing so I cannot do any of those things. I've tried wiping cache and restarting phone but still it happens. Guess I'll have to try one of the other apps...",0
"Everytime I'm listening to a podcast and turn the screen the off, my media will stop playing almost 100% of the time, even if the timer is on and set to a later time. Sometimes the player stays stuck on a past episode, or it reads a timestamp that I've already passed long ago, making me lose my place. If Spotify wants to seriously contend with other podcast platforms it needs to address these chronic issues",0
This app is Love Every Single Song is there I had 4 playlists with more than 500 songs ðŸ¥°,1
"Phenomenal selection of music, excellent quality and a user friendly gui makes this a great app. Thank you the Developers.",1
Yet again!!! Constantly drops out. Can't get more than half way through podcast. Can't use the dashboard because it's stuck an episode from 2 hrs ago. So frustrating!!!!,0
Wow,1
"I've started experiencing a problem where if I'm connected to wifi Spotify won't let me search for a song, but on internet it works fine. Initially I thought it was a problem with my wifi, but all other apps work fine",1
Best music app. Also looks great on foldable devices.,1
I have a Samsung s10+ and Spotify previously worked fine. But recently the playbar has disappeared and songs are glitching or stop completely! Would not recommend.,0
I enjoy my Spotify app because I can play it through my car and avoid all the useless talking and listen to gospel music as much as I want. I recommend Spotify because of its wide range of music and it has all of my favorite musicians singing my favorite songs.,1
I like it a lot but you can not put the music you want and uneoro show some pictures gore.. But I'm not in a way to stop using,1
Absolutely horrible every update it's even harder to get the song you want to play I installed it just so I don't have to install songs and I don't want to pay just to listen to the song that I want to :(,0
"Here's a problem. On the homepage it gives you various categories, & then lists 8 or so albums you might enjoy based on your listening habits. A good percentage of the time, the categories refresh & the list that I was looking at disappears. Sometimes it will return later in the day. Sometimes not at all. Now I've started screencapping the line I'm interested in because it happens so often. It's usually only the list I'm interested in and clicking on that disappears. Android Pixel 4a 5G",0
"Love the app, lowkey the premium version makes it so much better.",1
"The best music app. Easy to use, excellent selection of music. Useful online or offline. Much better than Apple music (which I uninstalled)",1
Please add year filters. So when we browsing genre or artist we can choose year of production as well as stand alone year filter without genre/artist. I don't know why no one has done this yet.,0
"Any classical, pop, kpop, jazz, Cantonese, HK pop music, anything, I can listen to. I really enjoyed it. Especially when I am working out in the gym.",1
"It's A Good App To Listen To Music, It's A Pretty Good App, But There Is One Big Problem. The App Doesn't Function The Same As The PC One, Infact The Mobile Version Is A Significant Downgrade From The PC Version. You Cannot Pick Your Specific Songs From Your Own Playlists Unless You Have Premium, You Only Got Shuffle Play, So If You Fix This Issue, I'll Give It A 4-5 Star Rating. Thank You.",0
I enjoy the variety of music Spotify offers .. although I am not that versed on music Spotify always seems to have a sound that I really enjoy. I would recommend this tool to others.,1
"There are UI bugs in latest version, it hangs and I can't see my current media playing section at all in app. It behaves weirdly witj Bluetooth as well, it is not reliable like before while driving. Please fix I use Spotify for quality and this is unexpected.",0
Good app great for podcasts and motivation,1
The best app so far for music lovers. Virtually all genres of music with a lot of features to make listening a pleasure.,1
My play button and previous/next buttons are all messed up after One of the recent updates. The pause/play button is all the way to the right with the back/next buttons pushed all the way to the left. Ugly and a little unsettling.,0
"I love the app, it has the music I like",1
"Spotify has been constantly crashing and buggy lately. Losing sound until I restart, skipping like a trackman when my phone has the screen off. Poor connectivity to my google home devices. Will stop paying for my membership if not fixed soon.",0
"WHERE IS MY ENCHANCED PLAYLIST BUTTON??? a month ago i cannot find my now playing button , i love spotify but now it is very buggy , too bad i might move to deezer soon",0

Never thought I'd enjoy music streaming services until now. YouTube and Spotify are my apps of choice for audio whatwith the downfall Google Play Music.,0
"I love this app a lot!!! All you have to do is look up the song and there is no adds, and it comes in clearly! I use it all the time. Love it. ðŸ˜ðŸ˜",1
Happy about the library but need individual download option. Please add the option to download a particular/individual song song together with bulk download. Album download can also have particular single track download. Won't it be great?,0
Really amazing nothing wrong except having to pay for premium to play certain songs if it were free I would use it way more often,1
Really helpful in organising my playlist. Recommendations need to be improved as alot of the songs added are either already in my playlist or keep being repetitive. There are so much more songs spotify has not recommended to me. The shuffle option also seems to just choose a select number of songs to play on my playlist.,0
Best use while riding on bike,1
This app made me so mad. One day I opened the app to listen to some nice music and then I was logged out. I was like weird. So then I try logging back in and then my login dosent even work. I had the email and password correct and it just was not working. So then I thought maybe the servers are down. So I waited till tommorow and the next day and tried logging back in multiple times and it still didn't work. I had to create a whole new account and even lost my premium. Good job spotify.,0
This app is really good but sometimes there are not lyrics :(,0
Everything Is Ok. Except Those Ads Even Though Premium has various perks discounts and stuff you can atleast moderate the traffic a bit. Best of luck for future <3,1
"This app is exceptional, a Playlist was created for me and it was perfect ðŸ¥º, like tailor made. Began to wonder how they knew all my favorite songs. Bravo",1
"Extremely frustrating app. Lots of content, but half the time it won't let me play the music I have downloaded onto my phone, forcing me to stream instead, leaving me with 30gb of unusable data on my phone and SOL whenever I don't have cell service.",0
I was actually starting to like it until recently when it changed to either pay for no ads or listen to one song then three ads.,0
when i try to put the songs that are on my playlist it puts on random songs that are not on my playlist,0
Very good.Good songs.,1
This app is great until it starts constantly skipping songs on it's own every 15-30 seconds. Then it is wildly frustrating.,0
"At first, I really liked this app because it let me hear the songs I loved after clicking on them, but a few month later, I realized I could do that but it was much more harder for me to get the song going. I went in the app and I tried to pick a song I liked in my playlist, liked songs l, but when I clicked on the song it didn't play all of it, it only played a few seconds of the song to show what it sounded like. I searched it and played it but instead it played a different song!",0
"Really glitchy ,it used to work but now the song I'm playing doesn't come up as playing and it used to stop playing music when I went onto another app (tiktok) now it doesn't",0
My experience with Spotify is pretty good. Everything is neat and clean. Ads are a bit annoying but other than that everything's fine.,1
"Excellent app. Better than pandora by a million times. Absolutely paying for it, it's worth it.",1
"Spotify is a pretty great music streaming app, however in more recent months Spotify is very clear in their favor for money and profit then they are in stopping COVID-19 misinformation from podcasts on their platform. It's a shame that Spotify cares more about their capital than about public health and safety. Not to mention, Spotify also completely rips off artists and gives them barely any compensation for the streams on their art/IP.",0
Very buggy. Tech support doesn't help.,0
I am happy by listening songs with spotify,1
"Love Spotify, and the student discount for premium.",1
Has all my favorite songs and artists,1
Too much ads,0
Song recommendations can be better. Many songs overlap in different playlists,0
This is a very good music streaming service with or without premium.,1
crashes also not working ok on android auto,0
The app works well when it works but still has bugs where you can't play saved songs on your device when it. Everything they suggest to fix it is just a temp fix and it goes back years.,0
App crashing not even playing single song,0
Bro give me back the thing to hear a song before I put it in my playlist ðŸ˜­,0
I give it 4.5 stars It should let u rewind song and pick what u want to hear by choice . Not follow the order,0
"Nothing you can do will get Spotify to stop eating your data plan. Updated: Spotify decided to log my account out. Then refused to log back in b/c I was in ""offline mode"" when I logged out. Reloading app & 12 Gb of data for a known bug.",0
New update has caused issues. My music stops playing randomly.,0
"It keeps popping ""Your offline"" even tho my internet access is strong",1
"I'm in love with app!!!Iâ£ï¸The sound quality it has is super good!!!ðŸ”¥The only fault I would like to pinpoint is ,it has tons of ads popping while listening to the music which is preety irritating!!! Fixing that makes it so much better!!!!",0
Evrything is good but lyrics are not showing up on myspotify. Like in my friends phone the lyric feature works properly but its not like this for me,0
Excellent experience very good music app ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
Very poor .. this app often does not open,0
"The app itself is not outwardly terrible, except every single time I use it is the most infuriating experience possible. Namely that I cannot play. The. Literal. Song. I. Searched. I understand premium doesn't do this but it is BEYOND frustrating when Spotify on the browser lets you play the song you picked. I have tried Spotify so many times but it is just so hostile compared to YouTube music. Because at least there i can play the song I've looked up. Here's hoping alexa can do YTMusic",0
It plays songs that I don't want!!! It doesn't even deserve a star!! Fix it!!,0
Definitely the greatest collect of music and awesome podcasts especially Joe Rogan,1
Great music none stop,1
"I like the old generation music and enjoy listening to eightees, ninetees music.",1
Love this music app !,1
I used this app i like it at the first Time with no ADS no nofications to join the prumiem but After this app with ADS nofications evrywhere to join prumiem the app will lag you cant get inside the musicðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘,0
Got the new update and now the app is trash. Never works right. Just freezes up and it's a waste of money. Would like a refund for my subscription,0
It will not let me play my play list with out shuffling or adding song that are not in my play list so fix this please i have not had this promblem befor but other than that it is a good streaming platform,1
"I download a couple of playlists for traveling, and I prefer to keep those on my SD card to free up internal storage. When I try to change the Storage location, Spotify crashes. I cannot open it, and I have to uninstall and reinstall it. This has happened a couple of times. Very frustrating.",0
"The only problem that i want to suit is the ADDS, There is always adds every next music lol please reduce it tho for free user. It is okay if the adds only appear every 2 to 3 time in a playlist.",0
"This App has practically all the songs that I grew ip with. From Freestyle to House & Rap, Reggae music. SPOTIFY RULES!!!!",1
"What is wrong with you guy why are you trying to force us to buy premium. Can't skip for 1 hour after 6 time said to buy premium, ad popup between song. you decrease these things little bit I will delete the review then.",0
"Listen to music on this app almost all day, every day. Super affordable and has a very wide variety of music available.",1
I think you also know the reason,1
1 start for,1
"I can't wait to rail about how you try to get people in accidents by fkn up the voice and getting it wrong as MUCH AS POSSIBLE to involve multiple clicks,searches,inquiries,etc...and if I get hurt. Hit you up on the fr fr.",0
I listen to spotify everyday I'm really upset about this Neil Young Issue. Do what it takes to get Neil Young back. I Have been a Neil Young fan forever. Now I have to go to Pandora to listen to him.,0
Great stuff! Playlists made by the app are very good. Wide selection.,1
Hate the ads,0
Absolutely massive choice of music and great quality sound ........ Real shame they stopped car view as I love to listen to music while I drive. You can pay for a friend device but as your already paying the subscription then I think it's poor .,0
"You're free. When I use, I use spotify.",0
"Shuffle function still isn't great. I'm left with listening to 100-200 of the same songs, from a playlist that contains close to 2000.",0
"Skips through podcast episodes after ads is most annoying, other issues make it very hard to enjoy my favorite podcast but its only place i can listen",0
Crashes all the time.,0
This app constantly freezes and cuts off while you listen. Spotify has done nothing to address this problem despite the fact that it is a common issue for many users.,0
This is the best music app I've used apple music and Tully by all means Spotify is the best I hope all their podcasts can post videos soon!,1
Excellent app. Great choice of music and advertisements bearable.,1
It weird glitch we're it won't let me pick my song that I want And it just weird so plz fix it and I will give it a five and it will be good. Goodbye,0
Spotify is really good And with it lyrics when playing music,1
It's always a full filling experience listening to favorites and checking out the newest and greatest!!,1
Best ever !! Keep up the Great Work ! I'm soon to switch over to the PREMIUM system w/SPOTIFY!!!,1
"Wide selection of music, but too many ads. Also, the space it takes up is way higher than 28 MB. It will randomly jump up to a GB or higher after a while.",0
songs keep stopping on there own and I can't see what's currently playing ðŸ˜¤,0
"Pretty cool,but sometimes i ain't able to listen to all the songs",1
Very addective and super play list,1
"New update sucks, can't connect to headunits anymore. Only reason I spent money for premium",0
I prefer the old UI. But I dont see myself replacing Spotify.,0
Great app does what it is meant to. Took a star off because they need to make a way to pick up where you left off on multiple podcasts as I often start one then forget what podcast I was listening to then start another.,0
Love this music app,1
Good and nice music ,1
"The app is really incredible and allows you to pick from so many different genres.It also allows you to watch episodes and make your own playlists and has specific topics for you to listen from. The only cons are: *You can't even listen to ""a"" song without upgrading to premium if there is no internet connection. *Even though it says once in 30 minutes there is an ad,it appears once in 10-15 minutes. This app is helpful and motivational....",1
This app is so cool i enjoyed lots of music with great experience ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°â˜ºï¸,1
Bloody app keeps on cutting of whilst listening to a song. I updated it with the hope that it's just a bug. Still gives me the same problem. My subscription is going to waste.,0
Spotify is a blissful spot for soul mending Music. I really feel it.,1
Every songs N music available .just love it,1
"Truly amazing app..has become part of my day to dÃ y life activities,,,,,",1
Ads are really annoying. They are destroying the mood Plz change your name to addify It suits better,0
"Awesome, 8 years with this app!",1
sitijamilah,1
They shuffle songs that can be offensive in wording without your consent. Other things are good but that is a conflict of interest. Sorry not sorry Spotify.,0
"Okay, honestly the app is great. BUT I HATE HOW FREQUENTLY THEY GIVE AN ADVERTISEMENT IN BETWEEN THE SONGS. You can't listen to 3 back to back songs without getting atleast 2 ads in between them. Please fix this ðŸ˜©",0
Great music ads are repetitive but my choice not too pay,0
Cancelled my subscription with this antivax service. There are plenty of other music streaming services.,0
"LOTS of choices and easy to decipher type, decade, artist.",1
So much better than the previous music apps I've used. Offer more free music and other options that I've always wished for in a music app. Thank you!,1
Don't like Spotify adding random tracks to my lists,0
Absolute Love LOVE  Spotify got all the music i would ever need Always updated with the latest releases Great playlists and variety For every occasion Love the vast amount of songs available and the mood playlists it creates Music LifeSmilesUnity Highly Recommended ,1
Nice app,1
"Okay, this might be strange... I'm not asking you to remove ads in the free version but please atleast make them better, like I found some cool songs through them, but listening to a romantic song ad (for the 40th time) right after a scary song doesn't work, please create a system to suggest better ads according to the song genre. Also ADD MORE SONGS PLEASE! Thanks.",1
Wonderful! I don't know what I did before Spotify. Found so much new music!,1
"Keeps pausing when I'm not touching my phone, even if I'm playing on a speaker or TV ðŸ˜«",0
The amount of bugs and glitches is scandalous for a paid app....close to unsubscribing at this stage...,0
"Ridiculous amount of bugs for a premium paid app. Can't pause songs anymore or see what is playing have to go into settings and force quit the app every time, when playing through Bluetooth and change songs it starts playing from the phone and have to reconnect the device, downloaded songs won't play without an Internet connection so what's the point downloading them. The worst app I pay for by far!",0
"Good application, great music choice.",1
Lovely choices on music,1
"The most counter intuitive music player ux I have ever used. I can't figure out how to replay a song, how to go back to a song I just listened to. Its like the player just decides what you should listen to and plays it. It's annoying as hell. Takes me out of the zone.",0
Horrible. I always have recommended section and it is so annoying. I would never download this app ever again.,0
This app was amazing before but its now removing features that were once free and then adding it to premium the sound quality is garbage pls learn something from YouTube music its amazing and has an amazing music catalogue and yt premium is more worth it than your garbage Spotify premium,1
Very good music app,1
Enjoy it,1
"I'd give 5 stars but the ""play"" button & track keeps disappearing so I can't pause or change the song. I have to restart my phone. Otherwise, I love Spotify! I also wish the musicians got better compensation ðŸ™‚",0
Great clarity of sound and love access to all playlists without wifi on the app on all devices,1
Great app awesome music selection and quality.,1
"Keeps crashing, when you close it down it continues playing, while on Bluetooth phone calls it forces music to play so cannot be handsfree while driving. When it runs good it is fine. Those moments are few and far between",1
i really like spotify but there is a huge problem with the connection. when there clearly shows I am connected to WiFi it tells me some bs that it isn't and doesn't download the music that it can with WiFi on. until you fix the problem it will forever stay a three star,0
This app is a nice app for music and podcast and there are my favourite artist,1
"Amazing music library, mediocre and slightly buggy app. Missing the old UI (the one before they unified it with iPhone).",0
Paid for the mini which was premium and now they updated it to 30 songs limited to download. And the way to save the song you want to download is so sketchy. Plus the downloaded playlist doesnt load without internet. What???,0
This app is worth its keep. Have enjoyed it so far. Hope they can improve on the sound output.,1
App is good but had lot of trouble logging in once logged out,0
Songs say Lyrics but NO LYRICS has ever shown. Trash. Won't keep paying if it continues like this.,0
"Used to work perfectly now glitches, turns its self off and play panel disappears.",0
Since one and half hour i cant open app. it's not opening. why?,0
"I love this app so much that I dnt think I can ever be fedup of it. Nicest songs, best mixing from mixtapes.",1
I love this app and love listening to music on it just I have one current problem with it when I try add a song to one of my playlists It won't give the option to preview a bit of the song before adding it.,0
"Play bar keeps disappearing, android app is broken, hope they fix it or I'll cancel my subscription",0
"Gone down hill incredibly quickly, more ads than I've seen before , even when compared to YouTube. Sometimes the currently playing bar doesn't even show when you start a song/playlist and you have to close- open the app a few times to fix it.",0
"Frankly, its a fine app. A great app even. But if they only allow premium users to listen to songs in a certain order, then its horrible. Actually uninstalling simply becuase of that scummy and idiotic feature. I would be less insulted if it was just a paywall that didnt let you use spotify without paying a flat fee or subscription.",0
"Even though i have premium and playlists downloaded i still can't listen to them offline, only a select few. This app used to be so good but know it just gets worse with every update.",0
Great music app!,1
It was good but there's too many ads and there's a glitch where it won't say anythings playing even though I uave music on,0
"I love this app. I love how it recommends music/ podcasts to you based on what you listen to. This app is the most used out of all my apps on my phone, and the premium version is even better ðŸ˜! No adds,and you get to chose the songs you listen to on your or anyone's Playlist. I kinda for got the restðŸ˜… but overall it's and amazing app and if you download, I hope you will enjoy itðŸ˜- anonymousðŸ¤â¤ï¸â€ðŸ”¥ðŸ’Ÿ",1
Love it has just about everything you could want to listen to I have yet to come across anything I can't find or listen too.,1
30 minutes of no ads of you watch this 2:30 later ads,0
"The latest version is a whack,you can't choose a specific liked song to play ðŸ¤¦ I regret updating the app,fix this,and the user interface is annoying. Rating 5stars when fixed",0
Please add more songs of USTAD NUSRAT FATEH ALI KHAN I have seen that there are so many songs which are available on YOUtube but not on Spotify,0
"I love this app but I would really appreciate two things: 1. Ads: Sometimes ad starts very frequently ruining the mood and sometimes loosing temper. If possible you can fix that so that ads dont play before 30 mins. 2. Lyrics Language: Basically, I want to say that there should be an option where we can switch between the Original lyrics and Englsih lyrics of the song. Something like this: Original Lyrics: ""æ•™ãˆã¦ æ•™ãˆã¦ã‚ˆãã®ä»•çµ„ã¿ã‚’"" Engliah Lyrics: ""oshiete oshiete yo sono shikumi wo""",0
Blast music,1
Why can't I use my google play balance for premium?? I just wasted 50 dollars on a google play gift card and i can't figure out how to use my google play balance for spotify. If there is a way please tell me !!! Other than this it is fine.,0
I love Spotify because it's free and you don't have to pay for private music,1
I dig Spotify I just wish we had more options for showing credits and a few more insights on the business end and that we have more protection from the so called promoters who manipulate numbers with impunity..that's what it looks like anyway,0
I'm not gonna lie the app is nice but the fact that you can u can't choose if you want to shuffle or not,0
"So I've been using Spotify for years. Been paying for it for years.... Suddenly this past week it has been closing or crashing when I am listening to the songs, trying to add one to a playlist, or just switching songs... This is very recent. I don't know what's going on but I hope it gets fixed because I love this app..",0
The app is not so easy to set up play lists as the website on my PC.,0
"Doesn't work with Android OS 11, has 'something went wrong, try again'. Nothing plays and is now unusable. Please fix.",0
Recent glitched have made using the app impossible. I pay for premium and the app has been awful and unusable for the past couple of weeks. Please fix!,0
"Was working fine with no problems until last update, connects to Bluetooth through my car and it shows that the song is playing but no sound. I've done all the troubleshooting as this problem has seemed to occur in past updates but no luck. Pretty much only listen to Spotify in the car so definitely not worth my monthly premium subscription. Disappointing.",0
I hate how it adds more songs to a single song and you just wanted to listen to that one song and it adds songs to your playlists too.Also why can't you remove songs?,1
I can find any music that I want to listen too.... Love this apps,1
I love this I can listen to my favorite except barely now a new update or somthing made this shuffle button haunt me it wont let me just click to play button on there it will shuffle it to a random song not even on my playlist idk how to even turn it off and now I cant even lisend to the full songs on my playlist :( plz fix thiz,0
Spotify is amazingðŸ¤© because i can get any song i want and there is a daily mix they make for me everyday that i can listen to,1
"This is getting absolutely ridiculous!!! 6+ ads all at once?! This shouldn't be like a TV commercial break! I think Spotify needs to get their act together. Just because some folk don't pay for subscriptions they shouldn't have to put up with several ads all the once every several minutes! When I first got Spotify it was 1 ad every 30 minutes, now it got out of control! Disappointed.",0
I love music acctually and the quality of this app is great!,1
Terrible. Seems I can only shuffle songs at random and not listen to the playlists I want. I believe this change is new and it was a bad one. If there is some way to turn this off I still think my review would be low because it is not very intuitive.,0
"Keeps transferring the music from my nest speakers to my phone without me doing anything, really irritating! Fix it please!",0
Great selection. Worth subscribing. Whole family enjoys having their favs playlists.,1
"Spotify is honestly not only my personal favorite, but the best music app out there. The premium they offer is so cheap, and beyond worth it!!",1
Love Spotify. Try it and tell me you don't like it!,0
Wow,1
They somehow manage to make the app worse and worse with each update. Going on day 9 of the play bar being broken,0
"It got even worse somehow. Now the app closes or crashes every 5 minutes, like clockwork, so I can't listen to ANYTHING",0
I love just having music that I like. I can find music even if I don't know the name of the song or the artist. I can choose my playlists according to my moods. I love that I can follow small artists as well.,1
"So many problems. Songs and podcasts start stalling and choking when the screen is off all of a sudden a day ago. Pay/pause/skip bar at the bottom in the app keeps disapearing so I have to close out the app to turn sound off. Also for around a year there is no small Spotify window with the play/pause button on my lock screen. When playing Patreon in my car via Bluetooth, Spotify will randomly override it and turn itself on instead. Version is up to date, tried uninstalling and re-installing .",0
This is one of the top 3 best music apps!!! Just wish there were less ads.,1
Nice,1
Too much ad,0
A lot of advertisment and not working my listed liked songs sometimes....,0
Too much advertisement,0
App consistently closes by itself just after opening it nearly every time for the last week. Please update,0
You get all the songs thats you want to play,1
Fix your buggy UI before I transfer to yourube music.,0
Very nice app to listen to k-pop and pop music but when I want to report they send the verification code I entered it but it shows not valid please fix this problem,0
Music playback bar is gone since last update. Can't pause or see what I am currently playing. How did this pass UAT?,0
"It's been an awesome experience,driving and listening to my favourite songs on my playlist.",1
Why did you guys remove the song preview when making a playlist?,0
"I love the app...when it actually works. The app unexpectedly unlinks from my speakers, randomly pauses, sometimes doesn't remember the last podcast it was playing and countless other random problems with it not working the way it should. Spotify needs to spend more money to fix these issues other than buying the latest podcast exclusive.",0
"Ads are killing it , literally after every song comes 2 ads",0
Would definitely recommend Spotify to a friend.,1
Apps used to be great but lately it keeps playing music without the play bar so i cannot see what I'm listening to or pause or skip the song. Please fix this Spotify.,0
The best music streaming app if you have premium,1
If you wanna screw over small artists out of any compensation for their work than this is the app for you. If you want to support the autonomous war industry than this is the app for you. But for me. Thats a deal breaker. Won't give them a penny or a minute of my time.,0
"A recent Spotify Convert, I am enjoying it so far and wothno major glitches, I would definitely recommend...",1
Thanks for adding swipe to add to queue to Android! Now app is perfect in every way!,1
Super ,1
The app is not working properly . Dwonloaded songs were shown in llibarary but not play and now dwonloaded songs column is not shown on my library . me also buy the premium for dwonload song Worst app I have ever used,0
"The app is just so cool,smooth and user friendly..thank you for the Premium experience..",1
I just love this app I can listen to whatever I want non stop,1
After years of having a free account I have decided to get a premium subscription and I will never go back. I use this app for hours each day and it works well. Only issueI have is some of my liked songs will be unliked or become duplicated in my liked songs playlist.,0
Free listening with high quality sound. Really good,1
Great all the music you want at uou finger tips plus it never drops out and quality is great works with all my devices,1
"Such an a amazing app for any day of week, make me feel like in a movie",1
"This is a great app but it has to many ads ,I know it has a premium option but the ads should be a little less and it should let us download song without premium",0
Unprecedented,1
"Good choices, can't connect to Alexa",0
I really love to hear music on spotify ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜,1
With the free version was as good as the paid one! Lost all of my saved music!,0
I've used Spotify for a long time and it's never failed to remain consistent. It's also been extremely quick to notify me when my favorite artists and bands have new music releasing.,1
The app is pretty good. The only big issue I have is that everytime I play a specific song it plays something else instead. I hope this issue is fixed soon.,0
"Going on 7 year premium user, I can't skip a song without it crashing. I drive an 18 wheeler, I will not drive without music. Get it fixed, or me and my family will drop Spotify. I gave you 4 updates to fix this issue, I'm about to lose my cool and change platforms.",0
"All ops are great except one. Whenever I try to search for an artist, it will disappear apparently and saying (Something wrong).",1
It's good! But please add a option where you can speed up the songs? I have seen so manyyy AMAZING songs on tiktok that are sped up and on Spotify they are so slow.. PLEASEE!,0
"Anyone who has loading issues after the update, read on! Take out your SD card, restart your phone, and launch spotify. It worked for me after doing this, even after reinserting the SD card afterwards.",0
The new update is very buggy. Music randomly stops. Or plays without saying it is. Have to restart it constantly,0
"I can find all of my music over 35 years, plus all the big bands, blues and classical I wish! Ride with it and never have too be bothered by pesky commercials or those talking heads messing with my vibes!",1
Great library selection.,1
It is working just as great but it stops giving the notification window sometimes ... Please fix this otherwise this app is just midblowing,0
"6 year subscriber here. This has been my favorite music app until the last update. Now it's very slow, glitchy, and lags a lot. And they had the nerve to raise the price? If not fixed soon I will be switching to Tidal. Doing it again 4/16/21",0
"Every update is quite buggy, sometimes the music player won't show at the bottom and takes a while to load and play the song",0
You deserve a 0 star but cant give it to you,1
I dont mean to be rude but spotify need to get their act together. The problem with Spotify is that it loves to undownload tracks whenever i go for a walk while its in offline mode and its inexcusable and really frustrating. Spotify team please fix this problem,0
Was the best music app but since last 2 updates it has made it to ware i can remote acces it wit my galaxy watch keeps telling me its not supported but it will let play music on watch if it's not supported then y can i play it on watch,1
"Spotify is great but the android application is horrible, many bugs. No need to describe, the user experience is very bad. . Spotify please improve.",0
Amazing but it doesn't have all the songs I want for example snail by awholenation or turn it loud the radio about hazbin hotel but other than that I am more than pleased with this app and it's music/podcast playing abilities love Kieran proctor or Jurassic64 age 14,1
Soy msico y musicoholica adicta a la msica y cada sonido se ha hecho parte de mi vida de alguna u otra forma En Spotify he podido encontrar no slo esos sonidos nuevos que me impactan hoy sino aquellos con los que relaciono cada etapa de mi vida ya mis seres ms amados Definitivamente recomiendo Spotify,1
It does not play the song I want. When i search the song with title it plays another song. It is annoying. What has happened?,0
I love this app as I love listening to music.,1
"Been using Spotify premium for years and generally like it, but recently it's been a bit glitchy including the app opening of its own accord and playing music (like when I'm on phone calls or using other apps), as well as songs skipping",0
"These are issues that has gotten worse over the last few months. App continuously runs in background even when closed, and will randomly start playing. Or, app will refuse to close. App will ""forget"" what I have been listening to when I pause and switch to another app.",0
Great music wish they wouldn't add music I didn't pick tho,0
"Right on, Neil Young. Spotify and Joe Rogan can get F'd. The Android app is terrible too. Cancelled service and uninstalled your app.",0
"I have been using Spotify for a few years now and have been pleased with the overall user experience and interface. I love that not only can find a variety of podcasts and music, Spotify recommends similar podcast topics and songs based on what I listen to, which only makes driving even more enjoyable. I also appreciate that I can be listening to something on my phone and then switch on my laptop / Smart TV and continue listening there. Great Job, Spotify! ðŸ’š",1
"This app is amazing!!!ðŸ˜ I love spotifiy so much, you can listen to music even when your not on spotifiy, like it will keep playing the song. This app is really good but I don't like the adds, the adds say ""listen to add free music for the nest 30 mins"" but right after that song there is another add. And the adds are very long, but overall the that this app is amazing.",1
Ankushpal,1
Works fine. Though sometimes looses connection with the web browser instance,1
Is my favourite app best app in a world ðŸŒŽ because my favourite song unfortunately 90 song found in this app,1
I cant play my favourite music cuz im free listener before 2 days ago I could to play my favourite music but now I can't I think because im in free mode,0
"Honestly, its one of the best apps I use right now! The song recommendations are really good. Though ads can be a bit annoying on free plans, I would still use it. P.S The premium is totally worth it.",1
Easy to use with some devices,1
"Randomly logged me out while I was listening to music, now it won't let me log back in. Keeps saying there is an error and won't send an email to recover. Update - came back on the next day. Since the update its now not letting me pause the music on the app it doesn't show that bottom bar anymore. So now to get the music to stop playing I have to close the app which is annoying.",0
Super sound quality,1
The best music streaming app right now. Great syncing between devices. I did have problems with frequent crashes on Android and Windows,1
"2 years of use so far. This is my favorite app to play music. Easy to use. I've found lots of music that I've never heard before; both old and new. My play lists just get longer and longer. I don't recall searching for any song I wanted and not finding it. I did notice lately, music sometimes pauses. Also, control bar goes away when I leave my car and come back. Music plays but I have no control. App restart required to get it back. Please fix it. Lost 1 star because of this.",0
"What the hell.. this update done rekt the whole app. Just randomly stops playing. Doesn't show what song is playing, plays in background when not open... Go back go back!",0
Keeps giving annoying ads in spanish! Just because my last name is Spanish doesn't mean I want ads or recommendations in spanish!,0
This app is excellent ðŸ‘Œ.But in some songs they didn't mention the lyrics but yeah it is good.,1
Amazing music service!,1
"Loved it. Got all my fave songs. To all those who are listening to an app where you have to pay for the songs you listen to, i reccomend Spotify. Check it out . :)",1
I love this app. Great variety of music.,1
Cannot listen to the album or playlist you want without this stupid app adding in suggested songs you don't want. Susggested songs are not even in the same genre that you are listening to... Useless! Stupid! And terrible!!,0
Great,1
Must ,1
"All the music I want at the press of a button or two. It's brilliant, thanks.",1
"Currently Spotify is glitches all the time, can't scroll through the audio time to forward through a podcast. Randomly sound stops or doesn't play.",0
awesome music app gets better each time ...listen to Ci$co for great music,1
YouTube music has better songs and the radio station you choose stays in the right lane.,0
My fav app. Awesome experience. Loved it. â¤. Try it. I can listen to all my fav artistsðŸ–¤,1
"Awful. Like just trying to listen to music. I got this and it was ad free let me skip it was great, now all I listen to are ads that can't be skipped, like what the hell. And I can only have 6 skips an hour like really? I highly don't recommend unless your willing to waste 10 dollars a month, which isn't terrible but like just no.",0
"Still starts randomly while the play/pause abilty is gone. Streams as it should, still very buggy. Despite the app being closed, and phone reboot it will still remain open in background and auto connect via Bluetooth. Once this bug is addressed it will be a much better experience.",0
Absolutely the best!! But if you cancel Joe Rogan.. I know at least 45 people will cancel their service including myself..,0
Gave 3 stars for the quality content provided but deducted 2 stars for the ads they give after every 2-3 songs.,0
"Cannot dismiss playback notification! Ever since a recent update, I haven't been able to dismissed the playback notification when music is paused. I don't use the new android 11 playback persistent notification so it must be a bug in the app, because my phone hasn't gotten any updates before that",0
I use this for all of my podcasts and media. Love this app. I even use it for my music when wifi is available.,0
"The app is great, I know - but the fact that u can't even play the complete song when you search it up without Spotify Premium just makes it basically unusable. You can only play playlist, that's all. Spotify pls fix this.",0
First time I have used another app besides ITunes. To make Playlist was a bit of an adventure. Could just be me getting used to it. Excellent music. I do like how Spotify tracks the genre's I like and suggests new music.,1
Last update was not great ...we cannot get music at correct album,0
"Continually downloads already downloaded music.. I spend more time out of service range than I do in service so downloadable music is what I pay for.. no good if I can't listen offline. Then after being offline, app asks for re login but won't allow because it's set to offline.. deleted app in hope to reset... Now can not download app to phone again after 2 days trying.. Was similar on iOS but the Android version is way worse. Now I'm paying a premium for something I can't even add to my phone",0
"Spotify has definitely busted something in the latest update or two. Constantly freezing on the logo when opening the app, currently playing menu only appears 50% of the time, songs skipping without any input. Two months ago I had none of these issues.",0
"overall pretty nice app. sometimes have issues with app loading, but i just exit the app and restart it and never really have any issues passt that.",0
I loved the app and i wouldn't take the premium subscription. Because I like the ad in the app Exspectaly the girl in the ad She talks to me and i like hear that ad,1
"the new update just doesn't work that great... it seems to conflict with a bunch of things and doesn't function well. like, I can't even see what I'm playing. boo",0
"Spotify has always been the streaming app, and the web player/PC versions of it are great, but the user interface on mobile is continually getting worse and the add load/frequency/timing is atrocious. Today I got 10 ads after hearing 2 songs. That's not an exaggeration. Maybe the code just bugged out, but why is that an acceptable number of adds as you typically cram in 3-5? Please make this app more user friendly.",0
This app is very bad because it did not give me the songs that I want and it gives me clips for songs and not full songs for example I was looking for a song and i was not answered I really do not like this app and it does not depend on it at all and there are applications much better than it but I do not want to say its names ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,0
It keeps forcing me out of the app. My apps updated and Ive been clearing the cache repeatedly.,0
"Its saying i have no connection when im on wifi, then it wont load my playlist i have just updated the app and the issue still remains",0
It's not letting me listen to music please tell me I don't have to get the premium just to listen to music,0
"Every artist page is on shuffle automatically and I have to turn it off every time I go to a new artist. Along with other things I cant turn off, I might be looking for a new music streaming service.",0
The best,1
Doesn't show lyrics and im even a premium. And the songs don't load unless I have an internet connection. Not really worth the money for a premium does it,0
Love the music and seeing the lyrics. Been singing along with wrong lyrics in some songs for years!,1
Ads! There is no skip option now! Why!! Inorder to buy premium ri8.ðŸ™‚ Frustrating! ðŸ™ŒðŸ» It was better before.,0
There was like 1 billion ads and I didn't even get the songs I wanted,0
No ability to connect any Alexa device.,0
Just like the music selections available & what I can make my favorites.,1
My experiences with spotify have been fantastic. Everything's easy to find and I like the fact that you can go off of other people's playlist to get your own music playlist Thank you very much for your services spotify is an amazing app.,1
Awsome selection of talk and music..more podcasts than i ever thought,1
Excellent user experience! Great selection of music!,1
Spotify is the best app to listen songs without any subscription but Spotify need to make a good playlist of top 50 English songs like Amazon music ?!,1
"My go to music app, first started using it years ago because no connection was needed to hear my playlists and I have never strayed.",1
"I used to like spotify before, but now I don't. You can't even play your chosen song. All you have is a playlist chosing random songs for you. I think Soundcloud is doing better than you.",0
I see a lot of people using this app to listening to music so I think I will give it a try,1
Ok app with free and amazing app with premium. Few bugs with Spotify Connect but overall it's the best system for speakers that support it.,1
New Updates ,1
I absolutely detest having ads at the beginning of Meditative music and Soundscapes. Its absurd! Some things should be off limits. Period.,0
"Sometimes it says I'm not connected to the internet, when I have good internet",0
"If I tell it to play the music out of my watch, it instead just goes to the Bluetooth screen and won't let me play it. Fix this bug or this app is unusable",0
Great app but ever since the update I'm not able to listen on music with my Bluetooth headset. It keeps playing the music on my phone's speaker which is kind of annoying as i majorly use the app at the gym,0
"Five star rating once I have received an update that you guys will release lossless option for songs. Every one is doing it, why can't you. I love Spotify and it's algorithm but I use apple music for spatial and Dolby atmos content. Please Spotify release the atmos and spatial option ðŸ˜Œ",0
I wish there was a way to play which song you want to listen to instead of having to wait through them all. I had the premium but I didn't use enough so I went back to free and i wish I could choose the particular song I'm wanting to hear. That's what I'd change.,0
Its really good would want to listen to it more,1
I really love this music app...alot,1
You can't preview a sample of the song when making a playlist anymore. That was how I found new songs I liked based on the playlist I made.,0
Spotify is the best music and podcast application but it's gonna be better if we can share music in IG stories and there is music coming out as well.,1
Love this app! Always listening to my music everyday on Spotify,1
"Ads are ridiculously overdone in the app. Ads play indiscriminately in many scenarios: after every song, switching to another station, pausing and resuming a song, rejecting a song etc. It seems like there are 3-5 ads being played per song. Very poor experience. Ads should play once at maximum per hour. Deezer has been better in that respect (so far). Atleast play different ads rather than all being about signing up for Spotify Premium.",0
Since the new update my touch screen in my truck doesn't recognize Spotify. That was 90 percent of my use for it. I don't think I need to keep the premium subscription anymore.,0
"It's nice to listen to music in the background of my games. My only complaint is that whenever I search up a song, it always ends up as an album and I have a harder time finding the song. Other than that, the app is amazing!",1
Best app for listening songs and the feature of listening amazing podcasts is cool but some issues are there like sometimes the songs are not opening it keeps on loading so i request to fix 'coz it has been going through from a long time,0
"its a good app, good music, but the new update is horrible. Why do i have to shuffle my liked songs just to listen to music? why cant i tap on the song to listen to the full song and not a sample of the song? it doesn't really make sense but it does what its supposed to do which is play music. Also the ads make me feel like i have malware on my phone with it popping up randomly.",0
After listening to some HI-FI streaming services I will be canceling Spotify Premium soon. The sound quality is night and day. I almost feel cheated I didn't know about HI-FI. Get it together Spotify and I might be back....we'll see.,0
Premium user. Now I can't play song previews or even listen to the songs when adding new songs to my playlists. Spotify sucks now!!! try another platform first.,0
"Very interesting app , I love it",1
"I few songs I couldn't get on there because they were remixes, but otherwise it's great! Not a single ad with premium eitherðŸ˜Œ it also continues to play the songs when my screen goes off and my notifications don't interrupt!ðŸ‘",0
Best music app there is. Legit not one song I haven't been disappointed knd.,1
The volume of music when using earphones is low but when the ads pop it will blow my ears and it has 2-3 ads in a row what waste of time I could just open my youtube app.,0
"My wife and I will be leaving Spotify (both accounts). Spotify is a great streaming service, however we do not solicit any product that bows the ""woke crowd""....ie the Rogan episode.",1
Everything is good but you really need to work on your algorithm for next songs to be played.,0
"App crashes a lot recently, I pay but still have to listen to adds",0
I loved this station station since I first had it,1
The new update sucks I have been using this app for 5 month's and it's ruined when you guys added the new update when I tap shuffle on my playlists song it only plays a new different song and it's irritating me plus there has been a lot of adds in this app even tho I bought premium it still have a lot of ads I'm uninstalling this app if you guys don't fix the problem in Spotify.,0
cant forward lyrics,1
Spotify is spot on for music lovers. The collection is thoughtful and the interface is friendly. An app that makes your feet tap.,1
How to create,1
This is the very good ,1
I hate the the fact that it just randomly adds songs and I don't even like them.,0
it's funny how a Melody can bring back a memory- clint black. God is a DJ and life is a dance floor-pink,1
I enjoy the choice of the music I like. I created several playlists.,1
"You search for a song and instead of playing that exact song, they play some wierd song you never even searched for",0
"I paid premium , i cant listen songs . Songs arent loading.",0
"songs don't load in my likes, i have been a premium member for years now",0
The playback buttons are missing in both the app and notifications. There's no way how to stop a song from playing other than quitting the app completely. A bad taste podcast I don't listen to keeps appearing and displacing stuff I listen to in my Good Morning tab. It's is a buggy app with terrible customer service. It takes over an hour of chatting to conclude they have no clue how to help you. They disconnect you without saying goodbye or asking if there's anything else they could help with.,0
"App works fine. My issue is content/censorship. If you'll bow down to a bunch of Hollywood types over their dislike of one guy, you'll do it to others. It starts with one and snowballs. What if these people said they don't like rock music. That you need to remove all rock music. Would you cave on that? It's a choice to listen to either thing. You don't like it don't listen. It's simple. Tell those people to start acting like the adults they're supposed to be.",1
Latest Android update is shocking - play controls both in-app and lock screen have disappeared and just stops playing every few songs,0
It's the best to find the songs you want to listen to,1
"My music is recently turning off, either while I'm playing a game or my phone times ouy. Never happened before, my cellphone provider said its the app itself but i don't know how to fix it , it's frustrating while trying to listen to music",0
Fix the App it gets worse with every Update randomly pauses etc.,0
Very nice app I can literally tell that it far better than the music apps and they provide new songs daily which is so nice of the app Iam addicted to the app,1
"Pretty much useless unless you buy premium. I like the UI for it better than other music apps but that's about it. Edited to one star. Not only is the free version butt, they continue providing a platform to Joe Rogan and his anti-science guests.",0
Good quality music can search any song ðŸ‘,1
"I remember when I first started with spotify it's use to be good, then the price went up and my playlists went down simple mean other things will follow, I will watch and see",0
"Like it, is good shows lyrics, but kina bad that u can't individually download songs",0
Wont let me play my songs and keeps playing other songs.,1
"Pathetic aap literally we already paying for recharge and then we have pay for premium if not the aap will continue annoy you to get premium ldk why is it so, the playlist keep changing adding third class quality songs worst experience at all there should be minus star facility so I can give -10star for this aap",0
Great app Awesome content and updated features All previous bugs fixed,1
I used to like it a lot when I put my own songs now they add songs I can't even stand I have not chosen the artist I don't know why they wanted to choose the songs I choose to hear I prefer to choose my own I know what they like far better than they ever will!!!!! I spend more time deleting songs and listening to any!!!ðŸ˜¡,0
Stop telling me to join some rando's session everytime i listen to Spotify at work. In fact give me option to disable that feature all together,0
"Not interested in a company that likes to dictate what I can or can't listen to. I deleted this today because I'm sick of the ridiculous politics with this company. There are much easier ways to listen to podcast and music and make playlists. Since that's true, I doubt I will be using Spotify again ðŸ¤·. I had thought about deleting months ago,but with the stupidity they are pulling and all the politics involved lately I'm happy to say goodbye.",0
URGENT FIX PLEASE UNABLE TO HAVE CONTROL OV PLAYING STOP OR SKIPPING MUSIC NOW THE PLAY BAR HAS A MIND OV ITS OWN NOW HOPE IT CAN B FIX SOON SPOTIFY HAS BEEN AWSOME FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS TILL NOW,0
The app is good and stuff but you can't play the music you want. I KEEP PRESSING THE SAME MUSIC BUT CHANGES INTO A DIFFRENT ONE so please fix your app.,0
"Its the best "" i love it "" [ nacho libre voice ]",1
the choice to make it so only rich people who have premium be able to choose to play songs they want and forcing people who don't have premium just to shuffle till you get the correct song like if the ads weren't enough,0
GOOD,1
Awesome app for music experience.... strongly recommend,1
"Keeps crashing! I absolutely love spotify, I'm a premium user, but the crashesssss!!! Keeps either stopping music randomly (more frequently in this week), more often than not these days the play, etc buttons just aren't available which is extremely annoying, particularly if you want to take off shuffle mode ðŸ™„ Minus regular bugs, it's a great app.",0
It was a good playing app .. now after updates it's so annoying,1
Nice,1
"I stream at least 12 hours of music everyday, all day and never hear a commercial or see an ad. Premium is the best bang for the buck. I recommend Spotify to everyone I know.",1
"When I open the app and click the play button for Playing a song, the app has crashed. Annoying...",0
"Too many ads, and the cost of premium is too steep for an app that keeps glitching on me.",0
Normally I love Spotify but after the recent update it keeps stopping itself and its incredibly annoying when I'm trying to listen to music or podcasts,0
Great app but advert after almost every song unless you sign up for premium which unfortunately I am not in a position to pay for that ATM due to financial issues ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜–ðŸ‘Ž,0
"After I read other ppl review, I also encounter the same issue.. I can't open in my phone, clear cache, uninstall n reinstall, off n turn on, log in n log out.. all the possible steps to recover back the Spotify.. but it still fail to play the song after 2 seconds I play the song..",0
Spotify free added a new feature that makes it impossible to enjoy your liked songs playlist without adding back to back random songs that aren't even in the same genre of music you typically listen to. Overall just a begging for you to spend money on premium as if they don't have millions already. So stupid.,0
Stop putting songs in my playlist,0
"I love this app, and plan on going premium. It has any music I can think of and tons of groups I've never listened to before....thanks Spotify",1
I had originally given this Spotify app a 5â­ rating but I didn't realize that it now skips or jumps as I walk with my earbuds on. Thought it was the new phone but I tried it with the old phone that never did this ever. Guess what it is doing the same thing on the iPhone? Looking for a better update from Spotify to correct this issue. As I've read in other newer ratings. And this isn't just happening to just me! Come on Spotify this is a Pay service and we didn't pay for garbage servics.,0
I have used this app for years and now I can't change songs without it crashing,0
-1 star due to excessive number of ads,0
Recently tried logging back into my account on my phone but was unable to. They would not send me an email or instructions on how to reset my password. There are also way to many adds. The app plays multiple adds in a row and rarely ever gives you an option to get 30 minutes of add-free music. Went ahead and deleted the app and got Pandora.,0
Fantastic app bc it so cool an easy to use,1
This application is one of the best music streaming apps but somethings i don't like are there are many feature left for premium only and many ads and small amounts of skips. Otherwise the app is great.,1
Amazing music app with a massive flaw The 10 dollars for premium is worth it since you can download music for offline and stream without ads But it's impossible to customize the home screen. I'm stuck with podcasts that I never listen to taking up screen space instead of music,0
"I don't like the new update, I was using spotify cause it was legal to listening music without using youtube, but since the newest update, I can't choose songs it was random and I need to listen till the end, I could skip but there was a limit to do that. Please bring back the old spotify",0
"This app is a joke. Started to get anoying by the 7 to 10 ads in a row. I don't recommend this app, wish there was a 1 star option. I'm staying with SoundCloud",0
Music keeps stopping all of the time. It's happening on my Sonos in my car on my Bose headphones while I'm biking. I would hate to do it but if this continues will need to figure out something else to use,0
good,1
Perfect app for music lovers,1
I love listening to music but the new update is bad when I try to pick a song it plays the song short when Im trying to listing to that song,0
Great app the only problem is that when I'm listening to my liked songs i get some random songs saying that it's in my playlist when Its not even liked please get that fixed it's very anoyinng...,0
Spotify give me previews back I swear to God I literally can't preview songs anymore and I am going insane I am kept up every night now because of this I have not once smilled since It stopped letting me preview songs fix your app or I will get violent.,0
"It's one of a kind among others. It's probably the best out there but the payment system, at least in Nigeria is fraught with lots of difficulties. I've been trying to pay for the premium package since last December to no avail.",0
"Best music experience ever all genres, nothing you can't find here.",1
It's perfect for playing music and shuffle for when you dont know what song to start with,1
Its a good app but i jus dont like the ads but otherwise thats it,0
Good but there should be less ads but good,1
"I need an option to add ""liked songs"" to other playlists (all at once)",0
I am unable to listen to songs without Internet (even tho I have premium). My Spotify glitches when I want to do group sessions. When I want to rewind or fast forward a track it just continues the play through as usual. The only benefit is I can listen to songs in any order but of I'm giving up Â£6 a month (thats WITH student discount) and I'm not getting the quality of service I asked for then I'll probably switch to amazon music instead.,0
I love this app I use it for gaming sleeping and at school but I don't know why the songs don't play in order for some reason it used to and now it won't that kinda makes me mad cause I want to listen to my songs in order either way great app,1
"I'm having trouble with the Shuffle Feature of Spotify across platforms. Ive already tried the suggestions and procedures stated in the Help. However, the problem persists. I dont usually use the 1 star review when having specific and punctual issues with an app, but I've used all other options and need customized support. It is really frustrating.",0
Really great app easy to use and also very fast,1
idk like this app is super make my mood up !!! thankyou sm Spotify.,1
Nice song playlists,1
Works well. 30 minutes free of no ads by listening to only 2. All my favorite songs are on here!,1
the recent update was so problematic and laggy. it won't let me use the premium features bc it keep crashing whenever i'm about to buy my premium plan. said there was no network so i have to uninstalled and re-installed it again. pls help me to fix it. thanks.,0
"Having problems to hear the preview of songs, I can preview the songs in my playlist l but not when I want to add songs",0
"Well.. I would make a playlist with only my songs but however there are other songs but I wanted to listen to MY SONG so.. it didn't work out. However this is a nice app if you want to try listen to different kinds of music That review was more then a year ago, it's my favorite app now! Thank you!",1
Works great in android car play,1
Crashes when I try to play any podcast but plays music tracks just fine. Very weird. Just started happening today 6/10/22,1
Handy in the car or in the shower for whatever music I'm feeling or cool podcast I want to discover. Can't imagine having to make do without it.,0
"I'm new to cellphone use. Grandson introduced me to spotify. So far,so good. Good selection of music choices.",1
Suddenly if u put songs in shuffle..the first song plays again and again Please do check this,1
I like their music variety and what I'm looking for I can find it. Is just great,1
"I love, love, love Spotify! Will always use it over anything else. Subscribed for probably two years now and won't be canceling it anytime soon. However, recently the app doesn't always show what I'm currently listening to and crashes after a couple songs. Generally a close and restart of the app fixes it, but not 100% of the time. Sometimes it takes multiple restarts. It'll this several times a day. I'm up to date on updates, too. This only started about a month ago now, but I'm not sure why.",0
Honestly this app is more than amazing. And I have been loving it a lot since I got premium. One of the best app UI's I have seen. I am waiting for Canvas and Hi-Fi to release in india.,1
can't play songs from my playlist I'm forced to listen suggested songs when I press play my playlist,0
"The software is buggy. Regularly have to restart. Also, when creating playlists, you cannot place the songs in the sequence you want",0
Love the app. I pay for premium. It's been closing down and pausing music randomly. I'll be canceling my premium this week.,0
Ever since the last update my Spotify hasn't been working correctly. It randomly pauses. Sometimes the next/play/pause buttons are gone. It doesn't connect to my pioneer stereo on Spotify anymore. UPDATE YOUR FREAKING APP!,0
"Amazing selection of music, podcasts, and information.",1
"Literal trash. I don't understand why I am paying to be able to download music to play offline FOR THE APP TO NOT PLAY THE PREDOWNLOADED MUSIC WHEN IM OFFLINE. Like come on man, what's the point of this service if I can't even use it on my daily commute? Fix it or youre losing a longterm customer.",0
I'm a Samsung galaxy user and it does not work correctly no more! No menu to pause or skip or play a song and it when listening it will randomly just stop!,0
"Brilliant Spotify , Does Exactly What It Says On The Tin ðŸ’¯ðŸ‘",1
Have had Spotify for years but so many issues with it lately..what is going on? Some numbnut is trying new ideas and they are not working guys....Have to log out because I can't even stop the songs....ðŸ˜«,0
Great music app!!! Got no complaints!!! Recommend to all!!! XDsâœŒï¸âš¡â›ˆï¸,1
Love,1
For the last week i have been unable to acess anything it says all my playlists are zero minutes long and womt connect to internet i have uninstalled and reinstalled dont kmow whats going but getting ready to cancel my subscription.,0
I just like lising to muizic so chose spotify and it was just perfect for lising muizic,1
"Good for playing podcast, BAD for playing music. Literally, why block the ""previous"" button, along with not being able to play a specific song unless i get premium. Also one more thing, ABSOLUTELY STOP ADDING MORE MUSIC TO A PLAYLIST, WHATS ON THERE SHOULD BE THERE.",0
Login is complicated after reinstalling and settings,0
it's very good for me to listen with a lots of vibe songs,1
Spotify is just amazing than any other app.,1
"Spotify used to be a great app. But recently, I cant do a thing on the app. Random songs will play. The music I'm listening too will just stop entirely, and the app constantly crashing.",0
helpful,1
"Wth Spotify now I can't listen to music that really want to now I have to click shuffle wth, it was better from the last version",0
"I wish to not give anystars at all, it's the most annoying app ever it says watch an ad for 30 mins of uninterrupted music and boom after just 2 mins there goes another ad claiming the same thing. I hate it, I switched to another player. Look for another players, trebel and audio Mack much better apps that allow offline downloads for free. This app ain't worth it.",0
Too many bugs/glitches that just doesn't make the experience worthwhile,0
"I'm music lover it gives me milestone enjoyment, stresses that affect in the mind of every one relief by listening the mellow or rock Reggy music. Music play important role in day to day living.",1
The one thing for me that it doesnt include all and some of what I want need and searching for or prefer but Its good and I really enjoy it good job and thank you for your effort and quality Its good to use a good overall all quality or chic app so please focus on this if you may the chicness,1
"Since the last update the app is not holding the track position in my playlists, it keeps reverting to the start of the playlist which is a pain when some playlists are many, many albums long. If you could please sort this out I'd be very grateful. Thanks..",0
"Been acting up recently here and there. Good overall. Will clear the cache and that fixes it, but there seems to be a bit of a bug in the newest version.",0
The join group session is trash. It won't let me connect despite me clicking on the link multiple times.,0
"Language preference is poor. If I have selected the language as Tamil, why Hindi songs and playlists are popping up for me which I don't want to play. If you selected English as language and Spanish songs are getting recommended, how do you feel??",0
Absolutely one of the best music apps.,1
This is a great music app I love it but I wish you could listen to offline music for free,1
"Hello Spotify team, I can't see the songs I have streamed in my history, I've been listening many songs since yesterday but those are not been in my history :( Please fix this problem, I'm not comfortably able to listen to my favs. I hope you will fix this problem soon, this is so suspicious (*_*) Edit : this problem is still not resolved for me, idk what's wrong with this app ðŸ˜•",0
App completely stopped working. Before the app stopping it would frequently delete all my downloaded songs which is perfect to find out when you are out of service,0
Why can't I pause downloads when listening to new music online? Just add the setting to pause background downloads. Why is this so hard to achieve?,0
Good app has a good sound quality but the only problem that I have with the app that I think u should fix is that it selects the music for u I think the user should have the option of which song they want,0
The App Has Become Very Slow And Often Does Not Respond. Please Fix The Error. Thanks.,0
Love this app. It's got lots of various song lists and many different genre's.,1
There was problem i will listing song than we automatically exit,0
"Deleted songs. I pay for premium. I should have close to 3,000 songs but Spotify thinks because I don't listen to 'em I'm a certain time frame that I'll forget about them. I'll have some saved for over a year, won't listen to it and I come back and it's somehow unsaved AGAIN. I pay for premium so I can listen to music when I don't have signal for Internet. It's so dang frustrating!",0
It plays what I want with no issues and minor interruptions!,1
"since 2 week ago, the queue is broken, sometimes Spotify shows that it's not playing any song while it actually is. When that happens I can't control Playback using my headphones media control buttons. Just. Really. Annoying.",0
"Every update with this app has the same stupid bugs. Whether switching to the next song it freezes or loading it, it shows a blank playlist. Could the developers code that if your repeat song button is on when I skip a song let it keep that feature to repeat the song. Instead I have to take out my device from my pocket everytime whether exercising, walking or doing household tasks when connected to my home speakers.",0
Quick and easy I just love the classics,1
"Who thought putting the pause button to the left was a good idea...if it ain't broke don't fix it, these ui designers are just looking for something to do",0
This app sucks I can't listen to a single song I want to hear I'm forced to listen to songs I hate what are useless app.,0
"Great app but......too many ads, I mean, ok if u want us to buy premium but atleast there should not be an ad after every song",0
Ads are annoying and shuffle play is too but it still works regardlessly so it's a good app for music.,1
,1
"Last update now renders my playlist useless, app stops playback all the time and cant start again have to start from the start all the time, happens 2-3 times every 30mins",0
Easy to operate has a great variety of different types of music to listen to. It's a great music app to have.,1
"Terrible glitches on Pixel 6 Pro. Restarting randomly after ads, stopping of playing, inability to skip back/forward",0
Worst app ever It never let me search any song showing no internet connection and at same time it shows me add after every two song hilarious,0
Good but its annoying when you have to pay for 1 monthly premium,0
Quality of song is not too good,0
I love Spotify it's easy to find the music I like,1
"This app is stacked i can't even play the next song,i don't know what i must do. When this happens on first time i desired to delete and download it again, only to find out that am still facing there very samething",0
GIVE THE OPTION TO DISABLE THE VOLUME SYNC WITH SPOTIFY CONNECT FOR CHRIST SAKE!!! I have multiple Connect devices and I don't want them locked together at the same volume. THIS IS A BIG ISSUE THAT IS AN EASY FIX FOR YOU!! Listen to your (paying) users because a quick Google search shows this is a common issue. 5 stars if this petty issue is fixed.,0
Gave Adele a touch too much exposure. Nothing technically wrong with that. Julian Alvarez understands. Almost as good as Beppe Grillo basically.,1
Besides the adds it wasn't horrible... but after Joe Rogan episodes were removed fo no reason.. I can't,0
Great and easy app,1
"Amazing music app,except that playlist isn't playing according to the way the list is.. it always keeps on shuffling the playlist",0
"Every update, app gets worse. Can't even play a full song. App always stops ðŸ‘ŽðŸ»get it together.",0
Spotify will add random songs to your Playlist and not let you remove them without premium,1
"If you are using Spotify free its unbearable, way too many ads. But the premium version is really nice. I can't wait for the wrapped this year :)",1
"I'm back, hope things don't change so much poor people or non tech people can still use and enjoy it. app was working great until one day chromcast web player showed up on it. Now if I try to play it my personal play list just plays aprox 1 min and switches songs or plays an album I never chose and don't care for.",0
... better off listening to Pandora... better yet. Youtube...,0
I love this app,1
like the momment with spotify,1
It is a great app to listen to music just wish there was a button to make it not suffle the songs ;),1
"Spotify, whatever your most recent update achieved, it's not effective. The controls for music/podcast are gone and it keeps pausing on its own. For this amount of $$ a month for a shared account you are certainly on your way to losing subscribers",0
Too much of ads song by ad song by ad ðŸ˜  how to i lesion the songs,0
It won't even play songs on my play list ðŸ˜¤,0
I made account and I forgot my password so I tried to make a new account but it kept saying this account has already been made would you like to log in so i could not ðŸš«ðŸš«ðŸš« make a new account pls fix that,0
Please add option to listen from the beginning when playing podcasts episodes.,1
GOOOOOOOOOOD,1
Dude cool app but there is one problem that the adds are very frequent and annoying they are long beside that the app is pretty good,1
"Absolutely love using Spotify, has music and pod casts to suit any mood. Love visiting old bands and discovering something new.",1
"I love the content, but the app is terrible. It changes podcasts midplay. It super frustrating.",0
Well I would like to say so far so good so much better than Amazon music unlimited and cheaper. At least you're an honest app that gives full new CDs of music that you promise. Much more music and information so far I'm very happy with this will keep you updated thank you much ðŸ†ðŸ†ðŸ†ðŸ†ðŸ†ðŸ˜Ž,1
"Always add tunes I don't like!!! I'd rather use my data on stuff I like, not wasting it on deleting s... .on the verge of uninstalling the app!! I don't have broadband etc so really annoys meðŸ¤¬",1
Listen to it every day almost all night long if I could best music app ever,0
I love the music selection easy to use recommend it to everybody,1
Most recent/ listened to stuff right at the top as you open the app so you can just jump straight it. Simple and brilliant.,1
This is so freaking bad. I have tried to play the songs i want but it puts anyother song. Spotify is so OVERRATED. that was an year ago but now spottify is great. I was just dumb im keeping it because its funny,1
I love it because I can enjoy a variety of music including complete albums.,1
Was a decent app until I purchased premium and decided to cancel it. Since doing so my ads have doubled if not tripled. Also I don't need to be recommend the playlists I've already listened to.What made me leave this review was 5 ads in a row.,0
I can't play 1 single song that I want it always plays a different song. Everytime I play my Playlist I can't choose the song I want to listen to like everyone else. Just fix this I'm literally crying cause I can't play 1 song I want without it playing a different song I honestly don't like Spotify at all anymore,0
Good,1
Too much ads. Using YouTube with ads has become a better experience now.,0
I absolutely love this app. I've chosen who I like and just hit shuffle and let the music just play,1
"App is broken, over the last couple of weeks consistently unable to control playback. Please fix",0
It is amazing but sometimes it glitches and it is amazing if u add still with you by JK (Jungkook),1
Spotify has all music all for free and sound quality is so good i love Spotify,1
I really love it my favorite thing about this app is the lyrics ðŸ˜ it's amazing I love singing along with my favorite songs ðŸŽµ ðŸ’•,1
Where's an update?? It will stop playing sometimes just not play the song I want. It also just decides to not show what is currently playing. It is glitching like crazy.,0
"1 thing That is very frustrating and enough to make cancel spotify and go to different music app, is even with premium I have to constantly try to stop suggested songs! I'm paying for this.I absolutely do not want suggested music,songs, or podcasts and I mean Ever! Yah, this is how frustrated I am! I'm constantly have to Uninstaller it , reset it to my preference, No suggestions pushed on me, and not on any one of my devices Ever.If this doesn't I keep subscription and will delete!",0
"Spotify supports misinformation, and I won't pay for that. Quit paid service and free Spotify is not worth it.",0
Better but I am long travel this app fine,1
"Is this a scam zone or something? I joined the premium (trial period) and it said I won't be charged until 31 March 2021 but that wasn't so, immediately I put my card details, I was debited. During the trial period, we have option of unsubscribing which I did since I wasn't get what I wanted. So why in God's name was I debited in today 18th April after unsubscribing a long time ago? Please I need my money back.",0
"My go to music app, their weekly personalized Playlist Playlist recommendation are always on spott! Many diffrent artist,and many diffrent style- from someone that goes from Death metal to Mozart in seconds- or from Norse music to opera, I've used Spotify for years and I won't stop Now",0
Its a good app but it makes the lyrics on screen go faster than the song,1
"The freedom to have any song, any time, on anything connected to the net. But Buggy (latest update) Devs: latest update seems full of problems. Suspect related to car Bluetooth and Google speaker groups. If any kind of transfer to a different device, my phone loses track and doesnt show what's playing. E.g. disconnect the car and the phone starts playing, but open the app on the phone and it says it's not playing!? Google speaker groups sometimes don't transfer correctly.",0
Worst app ever I use....play ads more than songs.,0
Music is less and advertisement is more. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ–•,0
"The app itself is good. Music selection is good. However, I have a huge problem with a certain heavily promoted podcast that is spewing vaccine misinformation, so I have cancelled my premium subscription and uninstalled the app. I want this stupid pandemic to be over already, and there is no way I'm giving another penny to a company that actively refuses to take down information that is literally leading to people's deaths. Shame on you for putting profits over human lives, Spotify.",0
Each Time I play a certain song and even when I add it to my playlist. This is kind of annoying and I wish it can be fixed if it can.,0
"This app sucks, I get locked out, change my password and it still doesn't work. Total joke. No response. They send me millions of emails but can find my account to fix it. Should change name from Spotify to NOTify.",0
"i like spotify cuz i can listen a music while playing on ps4, but there is problem since yesterday. all device that connected to my account has been logged out by it self, and then i can't log in. please fix this issue so i can listen to musics again.thank you!",0
I love this app I use it everyday and it always works,1
Great app...but many adds & you won't find a few Punjabi songs,0
I love it very much. Depression cured,1
The app won't let you access the music and podcasts you've already downloaded to your phone when there is no service. What's the point of downloading them to your phone if you can't listen to them offline?,0
would do 5 stars but a while after being set into offline mode the app gets wonky with Playlist and options for songs,1
I love Spotify it's an amazing music app and I use it everyday and sure the adds the skip limit to get annoying at times but overall thay didn't bother me but now my issue is that it no longer let's you preview songs before you add it to your playlist and it's getting really irritating that I can't do that anymore but overall it's a really good music app,1
"This app was my fav ,to stream music on but latest updates n their greed is making it shittier n shittier ,u can't even skip songs at ur will now , n lot of chaos dwells in there ,u search 4 a song n get a ambivalent playlist with no song i want old spotify back ,if u keep it like this u gonna loose alot of users spotify n then u gonna lament..",0
Please remove the good morning/afternoon/evening tab if it isn't going to be customizable. It frustrates me to see a podcast of a news on top of that when i barely listened to it in the first place.,0
Wonderful! I've been with Spotify since you had to be invited to join.,1
"I thought it was my phone but it was just this app that cuts out and during the song since the last update ,gonna try another music app",0
"It's fun for a while, then suddenly my music playlist gets shuffled and i can't control what i want to listen to. I hate it, very much... It says free but it forces you to buy premium nevertheless. Nice job at ruining a good run.",1
Nice app but I saved many platlists in my laptop with same account but none of them are listed in my phone with the same account,0
This is insanseeee. Love this no bugs. This is the best feel free to download.ðŸ‘,1
"The premium experience is truly premium. Excellent song suggestions and a vast catalogue. I suppose my only criticism is the inability to download individual songs for offline listening but apart from that, solid app.",1
This is a whole new world for me. I haven't listened to a whole album from an artist since the height of cds & record stores. I love the flow from one artist to the next. Very nice & convenient for music lovers.,1
"Playlist shuffle gets all F'd up when switching from listening from one device to another. Why is it so hard to keep track of what song you have listened to when switching devices? Been reporting this for ages, like i dont know why this is taking so long to sort out. The sign up process is ridiculous. Music service overall is good.",0
"Since the latest update it crashes all the times it shouldn't happen with an app that people pay for The whats playing always disappears and I have to close the app and reopen it causing the what's playing to go all together, this app needs fixing",0
Bruh its so bad like u made ur own playlist the few minutes after some songs some random songs will appear u cant skip. Song are shuffled in playlist theres no loop button and theres no unrandom button,0
"Quality has gone down considerably over the past couple years. No landscape player, frequent crashes, inability to play after using other apps, sound quality considerably lower than competitors. Spotify needs to try harder.",0
"Doesn't have nearly as many features as the home/web player. Please add those, I want to be able to sort through my songs from date added. Please fix some of the design layout issues as well. Also, I'm wondering why I'm not able to download my liked songs or select more than one to add to a playlist?",0
Somehow I lost the enhanced button. Won't come back after logging out clearing data and cache.,0
"Everytime I use spotify with my mobile data, it will work at first but halfway through it will stop. I've turned on and off the mobile data but it still doesn't work. My music jamming is constantly ruined",0
Works for me. Highly recommend if you can stomach the payments.,1
Best app all songs available easily,1
Why is it that I cannot play my downloaded songs/playlist if I am offline? This makes me frustrated. Even I turn on offline mode in my settings. The reason I am into spotify is that I can listen to the songs even I am in offline mode.,0
"Decent for music when you get to actually listen. I should not have to have 9 adds after only one song just because I don't have premium. This used to be my favorite app for any music, now I barely listen anymore and for a music lover, it's heartbreaking.",1
Ads are more I am not interested in this app i am deleting it,0
Been using Spotify for over a year and still great. Thanx,1
This is the best music app I have ever used. Although it had ads but it was not disturbing because after ad it had 30 minutes of uninterrupted music I recommend this app a lot. I can also create my own playlists and it had best playlists of k-pop and pop music which are my top favourite,1
Ugh. My internet is working just fine but the song won't play.,0
Love listening to podcasts on Spotify.,1
Need to skip ads,0
The mobile version of Spotify is currently unusable on my device. There isn't a way to play individual songs from a playlist or an album. The only upside is that podcasts work as expected.,0
Ily Spotify,1
"You have to keep reinstalling the app. At least once a month. It just stops during the song, up to 5 times. Thenrestaets. The only way to stop it is to reinstall.",0
Massive choices of songs and genres!,1
It's a top music streamer pretty obvious it's the best,1
"Hot garbage! Songs can't be played in order of the album, instead that's a premium feature. Yet this is a default feature on say Xbox. Edit: The devs are saying premium shouldn't be premium? X for Doubt",0
Trun Yadav,1
Easy ro use and lots of choices!!,1
Very good.its only that i cant play songs offline,1
"Isn't the premium plan supposed to allow the user to download music for offline listening? Well, when I'm driving thru areas with no reception (I drive through the montains almost every day) I can't access my library of downloaded content because there is no signal ðŸ˜‚, also, sometimes I have to force stop the app and even my phone (s21 ultra) because the app gets so glitchy ðŸ‘Ž.",0
Would be better if it had less pauses in-between songs.,0
"wow, they really took the ""enhance"" button from your liked songs playlist, always the dumbest ideas that make it through updates.",0
"Spotify is a music app that is fairly popular and has a very wide selection of songs, podcasts, and others without very many bugs",1
I usually love and defend Spotify with my life but for the past couple months it's been crashing and not showing the pause or skip button it's weird,0
"The app is good. But there are some inaccessible songs. On my phone and laptop, I don't get ads, but on ipad it's a whole new can of worms. The app is randomly closing today. It shouldn't be so. Also, ads, stop acting like money hungry sharks. You want people to buy premium to be happy, not out out of frustration.",0
All the music we want in one place. Great experience,1
"Amazing app, but please give us the ability to use this app fully in horizontal mode. It's very annoying that whenever I select a song, my screen rotates 90 degrees to vertical mode.",0
"I am a Premium user but cannot play music when offline, though I downloaded the songs. And the app is always crashing. Kindly fix these issues. Thanks.",0
"Absolutely love Spotify, easy to use, great choice of artists and making a playlist is so easy.",1
Best app for listening to music,1
Listening to songs without downloading is a good experience,1
I enjoy listening to podcast on this app,1
Simply superb. Makes the car driving enjoyable,1
"Ever since this newest up date I have not been able to see the bar at the bottom of the app or in the notifications for the current song, please fix this.",0
So delighted about the app and it gives you the chance to listen to almost all the songs in world ðŸŒŽ ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ‘ I will use this app always â¤,1
"Lack of settings in webplayer for Chromebook is a bit of an issue. Also, updates often result in drop out of paired speakers & inability to play through blutooth (car, echo, etc) - when it works it's fine but can be very temperamental",0
"Buggy. Whenever I listen to a podcast, it skips the final segment (after the ad). So annoying!",0
"If it's not one thing it's another with this app istg ðŸ¤¦ Look I know my playlist may contain an excessive amount of songs but why can I not play songs, I select a song my current song stops playing and then nothing plays. Only way to fix it is to reopen the app which is a pain.",0
Can use it in background and easy to use,1
One of the best app you can ever wish to haveðŸ˜­â™¥ï¸I promise you that it provides literally every genre of music,1
"It is the best music app. We can even make our own playlist . it is truley amazing music app.. but it truly have many adds .. It would be good if they just remove adds. After every song there is an add. Just exhausting.. Plz, fix this",0
Awesome reference to my favorite tunes,1
I love the music but not the ads if u are not premium ðŸ¥²,0
Every type of music of every generation is available.,1
I pay for my subscription to listen to every episode of a podcast. I'll find a new platform. As a consumer promising content and then taking it away is unacceptable.,0
"Won't play music isi get a text, it doesn't resume playing Can't pause music without closing player Very buggy right now",0
All around music at it's best quality,1
After using this app I found Playing next track takes long time even on high network area. It can able to share song recommends good songs according to our mood .,1
Completely useless on my phone now. Won't open or play anything.,0
"EDIT: ....why are you the way that you are? Every update you somehow make the UI worse. Not only did you remove the search/filter and then hide it behind a menu (3 dots), now when you use it in your liked songs, you can't filter by that. Hitting shuffle, after you've searched the artist, shuffles all your music, but only displays what you searched. What the actual hell. I'm blown away at how the app worsens with every update, please fix this garbage. I'm already shopping for other platforms.",0
Needs to be cheaper then a lot more People would join up.,0
Love The Dream. First podcast to listen to. It has helped me cope with my nightmare of MLM. I know now I'm not alone.,1
"Constantly have to force stop the app to make it function the way it should. The podcasts playlists aren't well organized. You can filter them by oldest or newest or by ones you haven't played yet. So I'd you start a podcast and switch to music and that podcasts was in the middle of a podcast list over 1000 episodes, you just have to search for your unfinished episode. It's a night are functionally.",0
Very good app. Keep going guy's!!,1
"How awesome would it be, if Spotify Music was free for everyone.......",1
"So many ads and can't even play the song I want, it always start shuffling songs",0
Hella dumb how you only get 6 skips every 6 hours especially the fact that you can't pick which song you want to listen to in a playlist or your own playlist,0
Love Spotify - love Spotify - love Spotify - What more can I say,1
all of a sudden I'm getting endless notifications. I turn off notifications in the app settings and the android settings. but I keep getting notifications. it's super annoying and I'm going to uninstal the app. goodbye spotify. luckily you're not the only podcast app.,0
"pls fix this thing, my playlist should be 7hours but it's shows 4hours only, and the other song's in my playlist are gone... please fix it what's happening",0
"Spotify is a really good app in general but if you don't buy premium you gotta listen to 4 different 30 second ads sometimes if you just skip a song. And I with you could listen to one song without listening to an entire playlist, like I wanted to listen to go by chemical brothers and I had to listen to a bunch of random songs before I heard galvanize.",0
Not sure if it's Spotify or Samsung but a song gets pinned onto my phones notifications daily. When I push settings there's no way to remove it permanently. There's a contact us link leading to samsung. Happens on Samsung S21. Tried to resolve with Samsung employee using remote but they could not help. Dont know how to reach spotify. It's forced its way onto my phone and can't stop it! It's annoying! Wish I could show a screen shot of it! IDK!?,0
The app is superb. Very cool app to play music. The favorite options and lyrics follow up is ðŸ¥‡,1
It's a great app never had any problems top notch.,1
"Very disappointing that since the last Spotify update song playing will not display on car info screen, same issue in my both cars.",0
"Ther control buttons to go back, play/ pause or go to next song are completely gone. Also can't controll Spotify via my car when connected via Bluetooth. It is playing music tho. > Reinstalled it and the music buttons are back at the bottom.",0
Why it doesn't let me replay my favorite song if I don't buy premium. It sucks how I've to always listen musics in shuffle here and I can't even loop my favorite song. The music quality is good but I hope these things get fixed.,1
So much ads. Why should i waste my money on premium. Remove ads otherwise we will all shift go ganna app.,0
Best app... I just loved it... Giving five star....,1
Used to be better. Now I'm getting 2 ads per song back to back alot... Like alot. Also the intuitive selections seems not that intuitive.,0
"Have to constantly uninstall and reinstall the app for the album artwork to show up Probably my sixth time doing it, oh well",1
Il love it,1
"My app does not work on my Mobile data, otherwise the app's amazing.",0
Not what it used to be. Too many suggested podcasts and genres that have literally nothing to do with what I listen to. For a premium account it is ridiculous.,0
It is so wonderful to hear music I love. Oldies I thought lost to me.,1
AWFUL new update. I'm having issues with android auto and also just using it on my phone. I pay for premium but won't continue if it can't be fixed. HATE the new layout. So confusing. Please bring the old one back.,0
This new update is going to make me change to another streaming service. Can't press play or skip any songs. Pauses music for minutes at a time without being able to do anything about it.,0
Downloaded music still can't be played offline as a premium user gg spotify u noobs,0
It's a amazing app but if it has been an option to download songs it's completely fantasy,1
Very good variety. Only complaint is repetition of some songs when there is a comprehensive playlist,1
I love it. At the moment I listen to podcasts while I work and thoroughly enjoy it. Keep up the great work,1
"Usually great, but once in a while my music will just cut out for a second and then carry on. Lately though it's been really glitchy and stopped my music entirely and sometimes won't let me play anything at all?",0
Way too many ads,0
"Love the app, but I'm having a lot of issues with playback. I can't control the playback on my phone or in the car via Androidauto. Hope this gets resolved soon!",0
"It's impossible to click on one particular song. It's also impossible to create a playlist, without Spotify messing it up. I have no clue, why anyone would use the app. Tenecent is also invested in Spotify, and that means, that all collected data, is being passed on to the chinese government. Not just your taste in music, but also EVERYTHING else, you do on your phone. Due to chinese laws, there is no need for you to consent to this. DO NOT USE SPOTIFY!!!",0
i've never had a problem with this app. keep up the good works,1
"They offer a wonderful way to enjoy the music you already want and love while also offering excellent new finds that usually match your interests as you rate various items. The free version uses occasional ads, but if you tend to be a ""set it and forget it"" listener, they only happen now and just then (like every half hour or so). If you're more fidgety, like to hunt around for specific songs and play them immediately, the free version will hit you with s good deal more ads (6 in a row onceðŸ¤¬).",1
"In my experience it is the best app because I think this is the 1st good music app that like give various options of choosing are own singers, we can make playlists, and also like search to different kinds of music",1
good variety just too many ads without premium,1
"The app is pretty good unless you use it on a phone. If you use it on a computer or a tablet you can skip as much as you want, choose your own songs and skip to any part of the song, but on a phone you cannot do any of that, you only have 6 skips per hour.",1
Very good app for using music and to listen,1
Nice app Alot of good music not that much ads Soo yessir,0
After bought premium for students not activated the plan on my account.,0

"New to Spotify, hut enjoying all of its features.",1
"Edit: They finally fixed it, listening to J.R. all-day! Originally, I installed it because of Joe Rogan, but I deleted it because of automatic car play! I've already disabled everything I can think of in the settings yet every time I get into my car it automatically plays.",0
Download playlists that I can't listen to. What's the point in downloading if you can't listen offline?? Paying $11 for this BS is frustrating.,0
The best Music Application.,1
"I find it difficult to find old podcast. I wish I could just type in a name and all interviews, across all podcasts would appear.",0
"Shearing my honest review,I am a story hunter, wherever I get it I just try to grab it as faster as I can,so this app does grt job to me.....I have been looking something like this,...So for me this is best",1
"What is this? I downloaded more than 2K songs with a premium plan. After the plan expired, all the downloads were gone. This is unfair.",0
"Spotify is great! Just have one issue, I don't have the enhance option for any of my playlists on mobile. The only way I can get the enhance option to show on my phone is by also opening up Spotify on my laptop. Please fix this!",0
'library' view is awful. I can't think of why you still haven't changed this. 'Liked songs' folder is fine but still no practical way to view list of artists with liked songs without individually following them all.,0
"Used to love this app l. I got premium this year and had no issues with the app until they removed the song preview feature. I can't tell the difference between songs with the same name now, and making playlists has become much more frustrating without even knowing what the songs I'm adding sound like. No idea why they'd do this, very disappointed. When will this be fixed?",0
took money twice but didnt give premium(chutiya app),0
Its very good its just that you guys removed the feature were we can see the songs and now we can only see the names and I hate how the shuffle button is with like the play button I am not saying it's bad but I would like it to be back it's fine if not since it's not that big of a Problem,1
"Fun fact; when I tap on a song, it's because I want to listen to THAT song. Other fun fact, when I tap on a Playlist, it's because I want to listen to songs from THAT playlist. The fact that I have to pay for very simple functions like that is really dumb. :/ Even Youtube gets that right. Also, the ads are repetitive.",0
Idk why but they made my account an ad-free account. So i dont get ads but i still can't download songs.,0
Best music streamer available.,1
Awfull.. when I try to open any sound file on my device it wil try to open in with Spotify even if I have disabled it in every setting. I can't use the app because of this. Have had to reinstal it every time I want to listen to music....,0
Yall changed my life I dint need to download songs no moreðŸ˜­,0
"1. When I use local files (mp3 songs), it detects my voice recordings as well which was is a new thing to Spotify and it's really annoying because when I try to play a voice recording in my local player it automatically redirects to Spotify. Please fix that! 2. Need another level of audio quality because I don't actually experience a difference between the low and very high qualities of music. It feels the same.",0
Pay spotify yeah you're pretty good but I know but I don't listen to much that because the email email the email that email the email was the hardest thing to make How do you Do this you're so amazingly good it makes I can't I just can't I don't know what to say you're so gorgeous You're waiting for this this is the last thing I said I love you spotify,0
I love this aap,1
Giving 3 stars coz when i updated Spotify it started showing no internet connection i reinstalled it but it couldn't log in at last after 1-2 months it got loged in it still shows no internet connection and my wifi works pretty good so hope it could be fixed rest the app is great thankyou!,1

Pretty bad. Used it forever because it's the only option but an overall bad app. Constantly stops playing for no reason. Uodate: now the app just doesn't allow me to pause about 50% of the time and the control bar is almost always just gone. Man this app is so bad.,0
"I loved Spotify before the most recent update because it would let me repeat the songs in my playlists that I like without having to shuffle and shuffling was only optional,also my music used to play without randomly stopping but now it does that often,I still love Spotify I just think the app was a bit better than before the most recent update,but this is all in my opinion.On the other hand, I like how you can listen to a piece of the song before you like it or put it in one of your playlists.",1
"Love Spotify, use it every day on my morning walks.",1
"I think it's a whole load of BS, that when you pay for premium you still have to listen to the stupid commercials and ads. But if you pay for extra extra special premium you don't have to hear ads anymore that's total BS!",0
Can't live without Spotify. Love everything about it. Does an amazing job at choosing my morning metal for me. \m/,1
It has been great so far. I wish they'd pause the music when a call comes in when my phone is on vibration or silent.,0
Good app...secondly used. No lyrics w songs. And my Playlist won't open up,0
Subscribed because they showed the offer to 6months + 3 months free but subscription ended in 6 months,0
It's great but would prefer not to have a random songs not in my playlist played when listening to my playlist,0
The best music app ever. Full of choises of our favorite stars and i love that,1
All type excellent song,1
Very good music quality,1
Amazing app for music,1
I love spotify from how i can create multiple playlist for every mood and also listen to Playlists that are created by my own favorite artists and the ones created by spotify it is actually fascinating how spotify will go all the way out to find the type of musicgenre you like and start suggesting songs and artists Firtst   artist suggestion Second  spotify Playlist Third  flexibility of the app Fourth   fair subscription fee I will add another star if a new features is added ,1
Superb app for music best songs collection and songs quality,1
"It works for a little then after a while it doesn't. When pressing the play button for a song a whole different song plays something I've never heard before, or pressed on but it shows the song I've requested playing please fix this.",1
Great. Playlist and recommendations are great. Occasional issues here and there but nothing too bad,0
"Too Good. This music app is by far, easy to navigate, has a huge selection of what ever genre you're in the mood for and just all around COOL!",1
would be 5 stars but when I'm playing music when I've listened to every song it plays random songs,0
It's OK if you download only your favourites songs.,1
Way too many ads. Other than that i like but rather use apple music,0
I don't know why my Spotify is Crashing(I'm Having Premium) when Im trying to play a Song....I have Android 12 on my Smartphone V23.... Expect Spotify to Fix this ASAP.,0
This app is good but some of songs are not available on it. I'm listening punjabi songs always on it but some songs are not available.,0
Updated app 05/18/2022 and the player and controls are completely gone. This new version is unusable and extremely buggy as it is an unfinished version released for Android devices. 1/5 stars ðŸ‘Ž I need to revert back to an older version now.,0
Hi I think we need more songs on Spotify I really love the app I enjoy all the music thank you for thank you for Spotify please keep me in touch ðŸŽ¼ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸ‘â­â­â­â­â­â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹.,1
"I would rate it a 5 star if you fix this bug. So lately ever since I wanted to listen to some music, it plays random music I don't want to listen to! It won't let me listen to the songs I select. If this keeps going on, I'm forever giving a 1 star!",0
"Not to be rude or anything but it's annoying like It told me that I'll get 30minutes of uninterrupted listening but 30minutes isn't over yet and now I'm being interrupted I mean I just want to listen to music and yet the ads are interrupting me please fix that. And when I shuffle play my liked songs the ""unliked"" songs start to play and it's getting really annoying ðŸ˜– Also I don't mean to be rude or offend you but please fix my issues I just want to hear music and listen peacefully that's all ^^",0
Awesome and cheap! Use it everyday and I have a premium account! I uses use pandora but they had a limited selection so I decided to try this and it's awesome (please free my family),1
The app keeps on crashing down every time I try playing a song. This is happening from last one week. Reinstalled multiple times but no good happened.,0
I love this app this is useful app and especially this app in song with lyrics my favourite part the lyrics sometime I can't understand songs but with lyrics I easily understood songs i love it ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ˜ºðŸ»ðŸ¨ðŸ‡ðŸ‘ðŸ´ðŸ¥ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—,1
"Only 6 skips per hour, it shuffles every playlist you listen to, as every 1-2 song, expensive subscription, cant listen to something in repeat. This is my experience in the first 20 minutes of spotify. In PC or PS4 all of these are different in a better way (excluding subscription cost). Aren't spotify ashamed?",0
"This application is not good for my ears, in my experience the app has several advertisements about some drag queen. the advertisments that were first issue with me was the cinnamon toast crunch ads that made a loud slurping sound in my ears. Overall the app is nice, but it is not worth using for me given the unacceptable advertising on the platform, especially because they are loud.",0
Great for specific tastes or random recommendations.,1
"Edit 09/06: They fixed it, thanks! Who ever signed off on having the ""go back"" button replaced by the ""like"" button in the notification bar please reverse it. People don't click like on songs nearly as much as they click on previous track.",0
"It used to work perfectly. I really enjoy the Spotify app however the app keeps on crashing, the music will just stop for no reason etc and it keeps on happening eventhough I tried quitting the app.",0
"Changing my review from 2 stars to 1. The music stops repeatedly. Its not my internet, phone, update, etc. Its spotify. Everyone should switch to YouTube music for the same price.",0
Good app. Too many ads.,0
Great choice from all genres EXCELLENT.,1
"Great app, love listening to music I choose.",1
Nice great audio quality mixing matches taste,1
For a music app it sure doesn't hesitate to play video ads. Extremely annoying especially since I have limited data.,0
"Everything is great, Specially the offers like 3 months free or for 116â‚¹ only.. So keep providing them also I like setting my favorite songs from Spotify as my alarms! So pleaseðŸ™ add this Fecture too.. That would make it a perfect app for me for now ðŸ¥‚..",1
"Software is unreliable, unlicensed music, acceptably executed customer service. 50/50 in terms of music discovery. Not worth my money anymore. Best of luck for you.",0
"perfect for anyone who wants to listen to podcasts and music free with ads. my only problem being it will sometimes not let me log in, but this is rare",1
"Interface glitchy, always crashing whilst playing and hides control interface of currently playing audio. Will be cancelling my subscription",0
Keeps crashing every few songs.,0
WHY CAN'T YOU HAVE A PLAN WHERE I COMPLETELY PAY FOR EVERYTHING ON SPOTIFY INSTEAD OF PAYING IT MONLTHLY WHAT IF I FORGET TO PAY IT!ðŸ˜¤,0
I love how I can turn off the screen and still listen. My only complaint is how it will play the next newer podcast file rather than go down the list.. it would be nice if there was an option to autoplay in either direction on the list,0
"Was a good app, but recently It has been stopping my music randomly and the bar at the bottom of the screen has disappeared.",0
There is an unbelievable amount of ads,0
I can listen to all my fav songs And podcasts,1
It is massive and crazy music,1
Good but if it was free it would have been the best which it is but I would like it if it is free,1
"As much as I love this app , when I got premium it was a little better. The one thing I would say was when I forgot my premium payment it wouldn't let me log out. and when I didn't have premium it was ok a few glitches here and there but no too bad for me. But if it was different then It would be better",1
I purchased premium and for some reason the app went offline since then and I'm unable to login or play anything on it. Sad to see such poor performance specially after premium.,0
Only way to play a playlist is on shuffle. Can choose a song. don't get premium. Takes 5 minutes to get the app to work. This has to be a joke. Can't believe I pay for premium when the app is this bad.,0
I love how personalized you can make your playlists and how Spotify personalizes different playlists for you based on songs and artists you like and listen to!,1
"I'm a latecomer to Spotify, but now I wonder why I waited, the curated playlists are great.",1
I hate the app>:( When I first used it it was fun I was gonna rate this 5 star's but now the app sucks The fact that u guys putted A suggestion song's on this app makes it sucks even more And I can't even rEEEEEEE PLAY MY song's that am playing,0
It makes sound sometimes,1
The play/pause menu keeps disappearing. Even when I put my headphones away it keeps playing. It's definitely hurting the experience on the app,0
"Great App, but facing advertisements after every song on both my PC and my phone. Please lower the number of advertisements so that people who haven't brought premium also enjoy uninterrupted music for a limited time. For example: After an advertisement we can listen to uninterrupted music for 30 minutes or less or After ever 5 songs an advertisement will be played and after that we can listen to 5 more songs uninterrupted. Hope you take this in consideration. Thanks",0
No cause sometimes I just want one song but then they some me other song that I don't want I just want that song not these songs,0
More Commercials before 30 min is up ongoing for over a month. No decent annual price since 2017.,0
Use is convenient but still some songs are missing and that made me disappointed.,0
"The playback info disappears and there is no way to know which song is being played,and how to pause or stop the music. I need to either sign off and on to get it back or restart my phone. Even with this,the application ,within few minutes revert back to the same problem.",0
"The interface has some troubles on the pixel 5, the upper menu and the search bar places itself on the upper part of the screen, right behind the front camera hole, which makes its difficult to press some buttons and sometime to read the information.",0
Love it Use it everyday,1
Will not let me listen to my playlist with out adding other songs to my playlist.,0
It log outs automatically and does not login easily it login takes about 1 to 2 days. Please tell me how to fix this problem,0
Amazing app ðŸ˜ðŸ‘ðŸ».... because I love music ðŸŽ¶ðŸ˜Œâ¤ï¸ but there is only one problem in this app that is interrupted ads ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜©,0
very nice i got this app. i can get all my music from it and turn of my phone and liten.,1
"Good sounds, good music! Enjoy!",1
App won't open my liked songs. Wasn't having this problem until about a month ago.,0
I'm a dj and like the music updates and jamming to my Playlist in the car,1
"Since the recent update, I am unable to play podcasts. I uninstall Ed, re-installed, cleared cache, phone data, and reset settings and it still won't play podcasts. What's happening?",0
Thank you for the good music you have.,1
I don't like how it adds songs into my playlist that I didn't add. But other than that it's good.,1
This app is buggy. It loses focus on the podcast I am listening to and I cannot pause or stop it.,0
These app is best,1
After latest update app crashes every time it's opened,0
Good app ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘ for listening ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ‘Œ music hope you all guy's enjoying stay blessed all â¤ â¤,1
"In general the app is ok but some frustrating features: I don't want to see podcasts, ever (seriously, get rid or I'm going to start looking for alternative providers), or Christmas song recommendations permanently top of my home screen in February. Also, just get rid of anti-vax contributors.",0
Very easy to use! Good quality sound! I really Love this app!,1
It amazing if it continues providing free music.At the moment I'm getting old music of my choice. Keep it up.,1
"Please bring back the side scroll bar in ""liked songs"" that allowed us to sort by date !",1
"I really like this app. All the things I liked are already categorized, so it's much easier to search for it.",1
The app was good before premium made you have to pay for half of the features that were free before hand. I can't even go rewind songs without premium,0
Very nice app I love it I give u 5 stars... just the adds are so much .... I love the sound quality and other features too..... ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ,1
Can you reduce the ads please and this app has a problem like when I play a song it's not playing at all it stucks in 00:00 so please look after that other wise this is good app for music,1
really enjoy spoify but cannot always afford it. have cancelled my subscription yet continue to be charged? twice in a row even :/ i've sent multiple complaints and have had to have cash app support help me but i haven't been fully refunded for each time i've been charged after cancellation.,0
Good selection of music easy to navigate,1
"I like how easy to use Spotify is. I've been on the family plan for a while, but when I wasn't, the ads weren't too bad or too frequent. I do prefer being on premium in order to control skips, which song is next, etc (idk what the perks are now, I've had premium for a while). I like the ability to have mixed playlists with my friends",1
It's good...but I can't find my fav song HEHEHE,1
Crashed & support doesn't give a damn. After contacting they gave up because every trouble shoot option they have DOES NO DIFFERENCE.,0
Best music surfing app with best algorithm on it understands music taste very properly,1
Best app to listen songs â£ï¸ . And also loved it's recommendationsðŸ’–.,1
"Almost all the world's music in one place! Just gotta have that wifi connection. However, every song you hit ""like"" on will save the track/s for offline mode just in case. 5 stars, best the ever has been so far if i do say so myself. Music is my passion! Without it, tgere is no B.!",0
"The advertisements state that you get an ad once every half an hour. It's more like every ten minutes. And it won't be one or two ads. It isn't unusual to get three ads in a row. Usually, they last about 30 seconds each. Even more so: it'll play four or five songs in your playlist and then it'll go on to play something entirely different. It won't even fit the genre you were listening to before. Very frustrating.",0
"Since the update Spotify won't play the next episode of a podcast, or the next song in an album or playlist. Instead, a random song plays and even after trying to go back to the playlist or podcast and physically tapping the next in queue, it plays another random song and keeps doing that until the 4th or 5th tap when it FINALLY selects the song...only to play another random song after. This is a ridiculous bug I'm paying for.",0
I cannot play downloaded songs. If I am paying for the ability to download albums locally and play them while disconnected from the internet (i.e. on a plane) why can I not play these downloaded tracks?,0
Best music app ever found. Just hats off to this app. But only one think I didn't find right. That after we add songs to our created playlists it didn't show the total number of songs in it. So please make a option where it shows total songs in the playlist. Otherwise the app is excellent. ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ,1
Amazon music is much better,1
"This app is only play for online, offline is not working",0
I can't access the lyrics to songs even though I am a premium user,0
"I do heavily enjoy Spotify - The fact of free music being available is nice and the ads are do able. I do own Spotify premium as I do like the app and think it deserves that money, And also don't really like ads. But these ones are fine. Recommended, 8.5/10",1
Something went wrong Give another go Fix that. I cant use my 1 week premium.,0
"I love Spotify and can't really complain EXCEPT........they removed song previews when you are choosing songs for a playlist! That's pretty annoying tbh because I can't just judge a song I like based on the title, I want to hear some of it before I add it to a playlist, is that not common sense?",0
"I'm not sure if it's just my app but it's beyond a joke now. My friends say they get 1 or 2 ads in between songs when I get 4+, I've even had 7 ads in a row!! Please fix this, it's incredibly annoying and I don't have the money for premium",0
music keeps cutting out,1
I love this app as it has all my fav songs,1
Maganda,1
New update has ruined the app. I'm having frequent issues with the Now Playing bar disappearing at random so I'm unable to to pause or skip without closing out of the app and restarting it until it inevitably disappears again.,0
It's premium feature is great i love it...and it's cheap,0
I just wish that there were less ads for someone looking for continuous music for stars.,0
"I don't think i need to convince anybody how good this app is really, everyone knows its the best music app lol, the audio is so crisp and such good quality, for listening with headphones or outloud on your phone or with speakers. ðŸ¤Ÿ",1
"i have s little problem on my spotify, tab lyrics doesn't appear when i'm playing every single song. i don't know why but i hope its will be fix as soon as possible.",0
DONT CHANGE! I love it. I especially like that on podcasts I can speed up the audio! ðŸ¤— I love being able to listen to the JRE!,1
"worked well for 1 day after posting a 1 star review. after latest update, back to the same if not worse issues than prior. For how much I am paying per month specifically to be able to use my downloaded content in offline regions, spotify is definately not worth the money at this current time",0
But it not have many songs of farhaan Saeed which I want like Prem gali pi jau etc and many many more so please pay attention on it,1
"The app is very hit or miss, I often have to delete and re-download the app for all the features to work. It used to be better but seems to be getting worse. Not great for a ""premium"" service.",0
"UPDATE: Now I constantly get a popup that says i need to allow Bluetooth on android 12 or something. Doesn't matter if I hit allow or maybe later it b keeps popping up. It keeps switching devices. I like spotify, but until they fix this bug where when I'm listening on my phone it switches to an echo dot at home this review stays 1 star.",0
"Constantly loses track or current podcast episode, randomly switches episodes during a podcast and marks it as played. I thought this was due to my older pixel 3 but the issues carried over to my new pixel 6. Due to these issues and lack of other heavily requested features I could never get behind a premium subscription New issue - Android notifications, like weather updates, causes Spotify to switch to the next song/podcast",0
oh mann....new version of this app is rudeeeeeðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡bring previous version please and cant sign in with mobile number,0
slow.. alm i can see for 2-3 mins is circling icon..,0
"Player sucks, service is ok.",0
"An exhilarating musical experience. Fun to find out new singers and interesting podcast. Got 4 out of five stars, due to lack in the hebrew songs data base, compared to YouTube.",0
It's a great app but when I tried to listen to a song it started playing a different one I tried to delete and install it again but it kept happening please help,1
"I'm not quite sure what happened, but since the last update, the music player stops randomly, the on-screen controls disappear/won't remain. Feeling like this isn't worth $10 a month...",0
Superb! But please make it easier to find USERS we follow,1
"ORIGINAL 2/2022: New design is nice, but as someone with a constantly growing collection of about 2,700 liked songs, I hate how the grabber on the scrollbar was removed. It now takes forever to scroll through that long list just to pick the song I want. If you could bring that back, I'll change this to 5 stars ðŸ˜Š EDIT 11/4/2022: It's back, thanks! ðŸ˜",1
Love Spotify but last few months it's just constant crashing. So annoying.,0
FFS why does it keep auto-stopping when I have my phone connected to a bluetooth speaker? So annoying. Even more annoying is the android bug that skips to a random track when you click the lock button on your phone. Happens literally everytime. Please add support for Android.,0
Absolutely recomend its an amazing app but one problem is the ads its alaway that same stupid add about northern kentucky unitversity damn that stupid place,0
Congratulations you deserve it,1
"I have no other app that crashes as much as Spotify. Ridiculous, with all the money you have. Edit: still crashing like crazy. Now add censorship to the list of reasons I'm finished with this company. Grow some balls, Ek.",0
Downloaded the app on my laptop but it keeps stopping. I did everything even logging out on other devices but still continued to stop worse experience,0
I mean the songs are pretty good but the update is horrible fix it please I can't play my favorite song on my playlist and I can't listen to any songs it just play random songs instead of the one I wanted to play,0
"I have purchased premium subscription to avoid ""ads"" but no use,waste of money,I am frustrated by ads....please don't waste ur money.....developers make improvement...other wise no use",0
Will pause randomly. skip podcasts midway thru when it's trying to play an advertisement. Won't let me play anything at all if I open another app. Very buggy compared to what it was 2 years ago,0
Paying for premium is perfect for me. I listen to music for hours at a time and having a commercial every 3 songs irritates me.,0
The Most advanced music app,1
Love it bI wake up to it and go to sleep with it.,1
"Can we see what songs are up next on shuffle, instead of just one. Apple music has this feature. Obviously this would be for premium users.",0
My only problem is the premium version of Spotify is out of some people's lives and choice,0
best app for music and podcasts,1
"When i search for an artist and get in their profile, only 5 or 6 songs are displaying.",0
Good Stuff for now,1
Do flips have to do it for a few months and I will be happy with totem and reel than the one you gave us to go fishing for the weekend of a year and then I had a few friends and a few other friends that I am not sure of yet to be able and not to,1
It's really good and all but songs sometimes get deleted and that's pretty annoying,0
I love this app cuz it have all of my fav song,1
Beat app ever... Thank you I enjoyed alot...,1
I dont know what's going on but I can't skip or repeat a song. The music thing in the bottom isn't showing,0
The only one thing I don't like about it... Is it doesn't have Smoke and mirrors by Black veil brides. But other than that 5 stars,1
"I love ðŸ’“ this app . It has ads but not that level, that's the reason. And you can choose your favorite artist. You can enjoy different Playlist in just 28 mb. And resso use 68 mb. So I prefer Spotify.",0
Constant Crashes Fix the app,0
Good services but no losless sound quality,0
I cant open my spotify on my phone. But its smooth when I use my laptop. I dont bring my laptop alot so I use my phone more often. Its very slow and laggy. I hope this can be fixed,0
"Very good algorithms to find my preference. Very nice interface. But it keeps stopping when my S8 is lock, even when allowing battery in the background.",0
Lots of ads but other than that it's good,1
Superb App it is very amazing sound quality also superb and no network issue it work in village area also I give 5 star,1
The App is good but I cannot Listen to the BBC news Podcast. Everything Else work ... weird,1
You broke it. This last update causes the app to crash constantly. Unusable.,0
It's really good but I wish u had given proper lyrics too but it's awesome app,1
Good but so much ads,1
Feature are very friendly quality is best,1
Just love Spotify!.....,1
The music keeps stopping and I have to unpause it it also freezes a log so I would like you to fix it please I love this app and I don't want to delete it,1
Really enjoy the ease of use and especially the selection of podcasts.,1
"Spotify is usually 5 stars when it's working correctly. Latley when I open the app and start playing a song, podcast or anything even though I can hear the song/podcast it says 'Nothing Playing' this is annoying since I don't have the option to pause or skip parts of a song or anything. The only way for me to fix it is uninstalling and downloading. I really don't want to stop using spotify so please fix this. Thanks",0
After latest update the music sometimes randomly stops.. then if you're lucky it starts again after 20 minutes.. really annoying whiel you're driving and dangerous because it really makes me want to take my phone out and fix it while driving.. also the app crashes constantly or freezes on a black screen.,0
This is my favourite app. I always use it every day.,1
Overall the app is pretty good except that its a bit confusing on a phone rather than on a laptop. I also don't like how on a phone you can't choose what song you want to play from your playlist and you only get to hear a snippet of the song. Please change this because it comes to a very big disadvantage for people who do not wish to purchase premium.,0
Thank you for updating and fixing the bugs and issue's. This is by far my favorite app to listen to music and podcasts on. Love it.,1
I like it has gud music and looks good,1
"Okay, I get this app needs revenue to keep their app running. BUT THE ADS ARE MORE INSANE THAN THE PAST FEW YEARS. This app lets me listen to 2 or 3 songs, then gives me 5 or 6 ads that are at least 15-30 seconds. This is insanity. And then they just beg you for Spotify premium, which isn't even worth it. All it does is remove the ads and it charges you like 10 dollars a month for it. This app was at it's finest a few years ago but now it's just shreds of a broken memory. 2 stars until fixed.",0
"Trying to use the party mode is near impossible, I had to spend 40 minutes to be able to join my friends session after he sent me a link to join. It's a shame the old option to scan the barcode in the app has been removed as it was the only reliable way to used the group session function. Oh and I'm also sick of how much music gets removed so regularly.",0
Offline not working even if u listen that song b4 u have to on data again,0
STOP WITH THE ADDS AFTER EVERY SONG! Fair enough every 30mins. BUT. EVERY. SONG. Is an overkill. Be a bit considerate for those of of who are clearly trying to budget with not spending $110/year for music.,0
Most retarded UI switch in human history - they changed the arrangements of the Buttons (from skip - play/pause - skip to play/pause - skip - skip) Someone deserves a special place in hell,0
Like the app but it won't let me play songs if I'm at the gym unless it's connected to a WiFi modem,0
"such a good app, but it's been so long I've not heard ""roti dan selai"" adsðŸ˜” please BRING IT BACKKK",0
"Collection not as good as Apple Music -- maybe it's just my strange taste in music. Here is something more objective: The Spotify app does not work well with Car Play / Android Auto in either of my cars, one Ford, one Mazda.",0
Always great .... been with them from the start.,1
The app is so buggy it's ridiculous. The tracks don't appear... Podcasts are hard to find and downloaded songs dont play when I don't have WiFi like they used to. Really disappointing. The older versions were far better which is so surprising.,0
I really really enjoy this app. It's easy to maneuver from the one music preference to the other. It's a music app you will want to keep going back to!!!,1
"Well I do got to say had to change my mind at first I thought this site sucks what not and in the end if you do your due diligence you can get back your accounts they're pretty cool you just got a member save save your Everything download whatnot it's just got to be a better way to download it to your SD card and s*** like that when you have 100,000 songs other than that f****** Spotify Spotify hit him up download it and go you guys rock 100%",0
Brilliant love the podcasts and the access to music,1
One of the est and easy to use apps,1
"I LOVE Spotify, can share tons of accolades, user-friendly features, etc. More importantly I appear to be an eclectic DJ! Can I get my username changed please? I no longer have access to the original email and I would love to edit some things like remove my teenagers' friends from freeloading!",1
Like it a lot no interupsion like it,0
My experience has been great. The algorithm has been good with my taste of music and podcasts. I do not like the black background without the choice to change the color like other platforms. Hence the 4 stars. (Meant to be 3 stars cause the color is a bug to my eyes),0
Music quality is not high otherwise it's nice. One star deducted for low music quality,0
I really like this app but there is a problem with it. It's that it adds random songs to my Playlist and that needs to stop because I don't like the songs that they recommend and just randomly put random songs on my list. It's so annoying that it gets me mad. I really hope that the people of this app fix this. So I can hear the songs only from my Playlist and give a 4 or 5 star rating.,0
The only music app I've ever listened to and this year I've had much complications. Back in January If I private a Playlist and want to make it public again it won't show on my profile. This is still happening so when I want a Playlist to be public I cannot make it private and public again because it won't show on my profile. Now I can't hear a short snip of a song before I add it to a Playlist and its so frustrating to me. Fix it please spotify.,0
Overall its a good app for music its been 2 months and still cant see the lyrics not all songs,1
Great tunes,1
Its so Good,1
Horrible. Always crashes. Takes 2-10 minutes to load even when in offline mode. Have to clear chache daily to get the app working. Shuffle feature will repeat the random engine seed giving the same random order of songs.,0
I love this app sm they have all the songs I ike.I don't know what to say 10/10 Ima get premium soon,1
Great app,1
I can renew my payment on this app with my Nigeria card and it annoying ðŸ˜’,0
"Pity. It's an amazing app if you have a premium account. I enjoyed it a lot. But If you don't, you can't even play a song you want, which is the worst. I mean, I would even accept some advertisement before a song but not being able to play it at all is too much. So it really is pay to listen.",0
The old version is much more better than the newest. I don't know why change it. It looks horrible,1
Spotify is being a complete prick lately! Why!?,0
"Love the create your own playlist option! Wish the ""Hey Spotify"" portion worked a little better",0
I can now mark podcast episodes as played in bulk. Thank you for fulfilling my request.,1
"I'm editing this because I now have premium, but the fact that you need premium to unlock certain features is why I'm still not giving this 4 or 5 stars",0
Worst app. Don't download. It takes your free choices and use it them against you in the long run.,0
The app is good on desktop and console but on mobile it's awful. They remove any option that allows to choose your music meaning even if you pick a song you like the app will still force you to listen to songs you don't want to. Don't download the app is made intentionally worse on mobile just to force you to open your wallet and pay for a monthly premium service. Instead just...ðŸ´â€â˜ ï¸ðŸ´â€â˜ ï¸ðŸ´â€â˜ ï¸,0
And me inhone bhi subscribe wala natak laa dia,1
ive loved this app since first using it in 2008. the more i learn how to use it the more i love and praise it. i have a large library! Still living it 2022. I use other apps but always come back to them,1
"Thanks so much for giving Android back the function of scrolling down on the Liked Songs page for the search bar. Never let anyone tell you that it's a bad feature, and keep up the great work lol much love ðŸ’š",1
Performance of the App is really bad and slow. The playing song bar on the bottom isn't showing up a lot of times. Have to restart way to often.,0
Can't listen to my playlists without playing songs that I did not add,1
"But after update this app show 2 advertisment, please don't become like a YouTube app , if I listen song then it play one song in repeat in some intervals of song. But other things are good i am happy from this app ðŸ˜ƒ",1
Great music hate all the adds.,0
It's good but Why can I not play the song I want to play. It always plays a different song than I'm picking. And 6 skips per hour? That's stupid,0
"The playlist is useless. Very useless, I want to hear the songs that Ioften want's to hear, but not just that I can't skip more than 6 times per hour, I can't also hear the songs on my playlists like wth? what's the use of it, if I even search a song I can't hear exactly what I searched I had to skip until It pops out like what else will you remove??? the entire spotify and only people with money can use it, it's literally so unfair to non premium user's, please just fix the playlist part...",0
Too much ads so annoying and also so much promotion of premium,0
I wish this app was free you can't even see who likes you because you have to pay for it,0
Best thing for hearing,1
"So far it has been nice,but I feel Spotify can do better by making videos available and also making singles available for individual download",0
"Amazing, although when you're a free user I feel there is too many adds",1
Brilliant if u buy premium which is quite expensive. If u don't by premium it's rubbish and better using YouTube but if u can afford it it's definitely worth it.,1
This app is so annoying I make my Playlist and then it just adds random songs and I can't even delete them I deleted the app and going to find a new one,0
It's good almost no ads,1
Just have to fix music suggestions and suffle. suffle music only plays my old music. the music that was added to my 'liked songs' first. it should in my opinion play my newer 'liked songs' and my older 'liked songs'. Suggested music should be influenced by my 'liked songs'. Which it appears to be somewhat but not what i would expect from spotify. If i add a song to my 'liked songs' right this moment. I would like to check my personal playlist later on tonight or tomorrow and see music like that.,0
"Bugged since a few days. No longer showing what is currently playing (in-app), no bar in notification area and doesn't stop music after a bluetooth device disconnects.",0
"The app is hosting podcasts that are actively spreading false information, so I'm uninstalling the app and no longer using it.",0
"Spotify isn't as good as You-tube because they don't have the variety of songs that You-tube has. It should be cheaper than You-tube, but it's about the same price.",0
Great app but glitchy sometimes,0
"I love spotify and all the choices I get to have. Rock, country, jazz, Classical. Who could ask for anything more!",1
Use it everyday! Great app! Absolutely love it! I'm really excited for some reason!,1
I pay fro premium and recently I have had adverts playing. Why????,0
I used to love this app but I can't listen to a song anymore without it pausing and I can't even see the player,0
"I HATE THE NEW VERSION, I LITERALLY CAN'T LISTEN TO THE ONE SONG THAT I WANT TO LISTEN TO BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PUT SINGLES ON SHUFFLE!?!?!",0
The inconsistent behaviour of the app is still annoying But it has been relatively stable now for a while,1
Pretty much only amazing if you buy a membership but reasonable price for a great product,1
Just don't recommend me any songs okay? I can choose what I listen. This is so annoying. I just want to listen one song. Only one. Why I cannot play the song? Sooo annoying,0
"Very limited list of songs, even though I have the premium version for free, I still think it's pretty terrible. Won't be using. Someone wanna swap me for YouTube premium ðŸ˜‚",0
"Good app all in in all. The recent update does not work on 2 of the phones I've tried it on (s22 Ultra and Nokia 9 pureview) constantly crashes, and needs multiple force stops just to play music properly. Multiple other reviews confirm this. Do y'all not test apps at all?",0
"Great app! In the last past, I only used it for podcasts, but I've been using it more recently for the music. I think the radio service lists me find new artists I like easily. It's been working much better than YouTube music for me since i started using it more often.",1
"A very nice catalogue, excellent sound quality (after some changes in Settings) and a nice plan for the family or just for one individual.",1
App is good until recently music stops just by itself and no play or pause bar isn't available can't be paying for this,1
"Since I canceled Spotify (hey, everyone, Napster is cheaper and pays artists better!), I've been sleeping like a baby. I'm pretty sure if I had cancer, cancelling Spotify would cure it. That medical misinformation is okay, per Spotify, as evidenced by the fact they're totally cool with COVID lies and blatant racists on Rogan's hate filled turdcast! Also, pay the artists, you soulless diarrhea splatter of a company.",0
Very good app for all music round the world.,1
"Constantly asks for additional Bluetooth permissions it doesn't need, and there's no way to turn off the requests. Spotify does not need the ability to see nearby Bluetooth devices, and I should not need to decline permission over and over again. Give us the option to say no. Not ""maybe later"", no. There's no way to block the notification via Android either, which is especially frustrating. If this ""feature"" is not removed, I'm moving elsewhere.",0
"WOW, THESE REVIEWS!!! SPOTIFY ARE NOT LISTENING!!! Glitchier and glitchier.. Has always been a sterling app but something has changed. These days it randomly stops and most frustratingly, will be playing, but the play button has the 'triangle' and not the pause button, so you can't stop what is playing! The only way to get it to stop is turn the phone off. Very poor.",0
I'm always finding hidden gems on random playlists.,1
"Just made this review, has a habit of crashing when it needs to be updated And it will not play over some apps. Mine just stops and when I go into the app it's like it's been paused.",0
"I skipped a song and i got 9 ADS IN A ROW and you only 6 skips per hour, and when you dont have premium they will add 2 or 3 random songs to your playlist and if you skip them THEY ADD MORE, great app if you have premium, but if you dont, its a horrible experience",0
"I am happy listening songs on Spotify, large collections of songs are there.",1
"I used to love Spotify, it was great for low internet and has a large variety of music that I can put into playlists however I'd like. However, lately it seems like I get ads after every song or two. Between ads, I'm told I'm supposed to get 30 minutes of ad free music.....so....why do I get 3-10?",0
It is the better but a am chose one Star because this app ads so iriteded,0
I can enjoy the music I choose.,1
I love it,1
I hate the newest update I can't see what songs I have added into my own playlists The app just generally sucks I also have it on my PlayStation but I am genuinely scared to even go on it because how bad spotify has became,0
Keeps cutting off and doesn't show what's playing,0
App was really excellent  Please insert download option and listen offline download songs  I hope you thinking about it ,1
It's one of the best music apps,1
"One of the best music apps. Hiding songs plays them anyway, so what's the point of that feature? Song categories are getting ridiculous but what can we expect in this new world.",1
I dont like that you have to pay to get ability to choose what you listen to.,0
"Just love the app, Spotify is literally the best for streaming music, even before I started paying premium it was just a wonderful app and I had to pay the premium as an appreciation",1
"I love spotify BUT the ads suck and it adds random songs to your playlist so I try I skip them but it only gives you 6 skips PER HOUR so,so annoying.",0
Fix your app or your not getting renewed in May. I pay more than other apps to allow you to use an outdated UI and the short cut bar doesn't load half the time. Premium subscription isn't worth the money. Fix it or lose to others. Your call,0
I love this app but I really wish you didn't have to shuffle in the free version on Android. The default option on iOS is play(even without premium) and not shuffle play so why is it different for Android?,1
"Why does spotify deletes all my downloaded songs daily, whats the use of buying premium then, i have to download songs everyday and see it been get deleated the next day. Fix it asap.ðŸ˜¡",0
Have premium plan. Cannot connect to my Pionner car stereo after latest updates. Still not working since January. Lame.,0
Amazing get to listen to the songs u love â¤,1
This app sucks balls. No search function which makes finding podcasts on a channel an huge waste of time. The last thing listened to just sits at the bottom of the app and can not be dismissed. Both of those bugs are a deal breaker.,0
"Since the last update, Spotify turno off by itself, when you are listening to something it does not move to the next track, and I have to keep closing it out to see if it works better but nothing helps. I use it every day and I pay for it.",0
I loved this app but it's been crashing so often that want to delete it!,0
Why you think adding songs to my playlist is good idea? What do you think? I don't know what I want? You socks!,0
Was an amazing app now I can't loop any song,1
"Works fine on mobile, if I'm on WiFi no matter which one it just won't load anything, I tried everything, the app has all permissions, still nothing!",0
I love Spotify it is the best for listening to music and I love music,1
"The new update is really not great for the latest version of android. Currently playing music is not displayed on the homescreen anymore and it makes it difficult to know what Im listening to, and impossible to pause/rewind/fast forward.",0
Too much add its to irritating,0
What's up with the volume being too low on android auto? It's way too low.,0
It's a great experience using Spotify and the music selection's are amazing just has to much adds and mobile user's have limited skips and on shuffle but Spotify is a good app and would recommend using for work outs and gaming,1
For some reason won't let me play any of the songs and I pay for premium which means it comes with offline play so it shouldn't be buffering or skipping or pausing or any of that,0
Best music app ever .....I found music here for my every mood,1
The  button should add the current song to the current playlist playing recommended songs and not default it to liked songs,1
"After two years of using Spotify premium, I think I can give an honest review. The app on Android is increibly buggy - the now playing bar keeps vanishing, music stops randomly. It's ridiculous. Can't believe I paid for this. Others reading this, please look at alternatives. Spotify is no longer worth the money.",0
You have all your favorite songs in the library and there is no need for you to look else way when it comes to listening to your favorite songs,1
If you want to download a single song you won't be able to do so because there is no feature for downloading a single song instead of that you have to download whole playlist and if you want to delete then you have to delete the whole playlist also there is no option for delete any single song you downloaded if you want to purchase premium membership then go with Amazon Prime music,0
"Grabage app, I have to uninstall and reinstall to correct a few regular issues, mostly the play button not working and my playlists not loading",0
New feature insisted upon opening when ever a bt audio device connected. The settings to dissable did not function. And somehow bypassed having run in background disabled to still do this. I have uninstalled and hadnt even open the app since i downloaded bandcamp anyway,0
Too much adds,0
Overall a good app except sometimes the lyrics are incorrect but still a good app!!,1
this is best app ever i like this app more than gaana app but i am gaving it 4 stars because there are some songs are not there,0
"Very nice music app with almost all music I know on it. Easy to make playlists and share music. Only too bad you cannot orden your playlists very efficiently. I listen to a lot of different genres and I have about 30+ playlists, which I cannot arrange top to bottom. Also showing your account to other spotify users, or accessing others accounts is a bit confusing but not entirely impossible, however, anyone who visits your account will initially only see your last 3 playlists. no clue why........",0
"Spotify is great but hasn't been loading latey, I will try to reinstall",0
"Great music genre mixes. Really blown away over the new, up and coming talent also!",1
Stotify this the best music app I've found.....please download this app if you like music.,1
It is pretty good but you need good Internet to run it otherwise the song just doesn't play witch is annoying but everything else I really good :),1
"I've had this app for years and recently it's been unusable. I can't even listen to a song in full without it stopping and pausing. I'm half tempted to cancel my subscription, why waste money for premium when I can't even listen to my downloaded playlist ðŸ˜’.",0
ITS THE BEST! ALL THE SONGS AND ALBUM R HERE! â¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ’š,1
"Keeps on playing songs i dont like when I deleted every other song in the Playlist. (Update) still plays obnoxious songs constantly, even when you have to take a tutorial on how to disable that option, just go get apple music",0
Awesome! Love this app for podcasts. Use it all the time. Thanks!,1
Its not working....i try to play music and it instantly stops and app shutsdown,0
Amazing. So many songs to choose from. It's just one of the best music apps I've had so far.,1
The best app for listening to music. This app even gives you the right lyrics of that songs. We can put any music at any time.,1
I love Spotify. Great podcasts and music recommendations.,1
I love spotify because the service is very nice But sometimes i dont deny on time to time ill use this platforms any bugs keep showing on this app,1
It uses a lot of battery but experience is very good about this app also it's adds not even makes interruption but sometimes it also informs us about latest updates only issue is with battery eventhough i have 5000mah battery is uses about 2% per 10 minutes,1
"Best music streaming app out there, as long as you got the $5/month premium it is the best app you will have on your phone",1
"This app sucks. The ads in between or in the middle of each song is fine but they play more songs that are not on your playlist than ones that are actually in it so you would go get their expensive premium. Sorry but I will not subscribe on your premium. I would rather download the modded application, greedy people.",0
"The app started closing on its own since the last update, have to open it again and choose a playlist",0
"Went from a decent music streaming service to an awful one these past few months. Spotify wrapped always crashed the app, sometimes playing a playlist just goes to ""radio based on playlist"" which occurs after the playlist has ended - when it's started. Now today it has redownloaded all my songs onto my phone when it was previously stored on my SD card with no warning or reason whatsoever",0
"This app is so cool, I really give thanks to Spotify developers all , and in the premium version , it is just cool ,ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ¤©",1
"Honestly love the app and have for years, even the absurd amount of ads sometimes on the free version but hey make that mf money boo",1
All in one... Always want this kind of app. It's totally perfect.,1
"Welcome to the new era of music listening experience. The premium membership is totally worth it. I have my family included in the membership because you are able to send up to five invitations for any of your fams that want to listen to music. You are able to share each other's listening history and share each other's perspective for the Love of music. As an eclectic human being, I desire many different options, and the daily mixes that are automated for me absolutely perfectly mixed. Thank you",1
alot of glitches. will randomly stop playing music. wont allow me to stop music. music controls disappear from display screen.,0
tbh this new update make it harder and so annoying...pls fix this,0
Seems like lately every time I boot up Spotify it gets stuck on the loading screen or it'll display the song but it just won't play. It's as though it's paused and it'll say that I'm disconnected from the internet despite having signal or Wi-Fi and all my other apps work. Also sometimes when I boot up and it the queue will disappear along with the player that shows the song I was listening to last.,0
Great free music. Some commercials but you get to listen to the music you like.,1
Easiest to navigate through and has most songs I like listening to...,1
It's definitely a good but a little problem it's has only a little skips even thought you have premium and when i make my playlist the song is short,0
"Very glitchy for me. Music stopping unexpectedly and requiring me to unlock my device for music to start again. If I am listening to a podcast with an advertisement, it will return back to the start of that episode or start the next episode sometimes.",0
SUCH A GOOD APP FOR MUSIC! LOVEEEEEE IT SO SO MUCH! THE BEST APP MUSIC FOR ME!!! THEY UPDATE A NEW MUSIC RIGHT ON TIME AND EVERYDAY GOT NEW THINGS TO BE EXPLORE!,1
"Glitchy app, too many ads, too many BAD programs with disinformation - app has really gone down hill. Uninstalled and cancelled",0
"I've had Spotify for 5+ years, and I love it! Without Premium, idk if I would have been around for as long though..",1
I always use spotify 24/7 spotify is my life podcasts of litterly anything like fanfiction anime and lots more and dont get me started on songs there are millions to choose from you will never get bored:3,0
Spotify fell off like u can't forward the song and can't skip the song more then 6 times an hour and to top this all off u can't play a specific song and when they say listen to uninterrupted music for 30 mins after watching the short video they only play 10 minutes of music,0
"As per most of the recent reviews, the app keeps cutting out and if this isn't fixed soon, I'll consider moving to Deezer. I used to love the Spotify app but not since one has to keep restarting the music continuously! Samsung S21plus",0
User friendly and efficient,1
My experience with this app has been absolutely awesome  all the way,1
"The app has started screwing up over the last month. The sort of ""now playing"" bar that is at the bottom will just disappear. Once that happens, the music will stop as soon as your phone screen goes dark and you can't pause it. You've gotta force close the app. Multiple times a day.",0
Censorship is RAMPANT no matter your settings or subscription status. Not into Kids Bop radio.,0
"Fix your app, it auto plays when not used. And gets stuck on old podcast. 1-17-22 app for Android still turns itself on randomly and plays just starts playing old stuff you listened to and it won't let you turn it off unless you uninstall the app.",0
I love spotify but am not diggin the patch. I need my music to stream not gurgle.,1
Premium is Definitely worth the money for music lovers like myself. My boss lets me play music in the kitchen all day and its really nice to just move aling the playlist without interruptions. 5/5,1
"Edit. I have just reduced my rating. I'm getting bombarded everyday when I start spotify, with it asking me to turn on bluetooth. I shall turn on bluetooth at times I need to, and should not be forced into it by an app I pay a lot of money for. Give it a rest with the relentless notifications",0
Very good aap whichever I hope to play my favorite song this aap fulfill my desire Thank you very much spotify,1
Song downloading feature should be added to this app without premium subscription.,0
"*Still stand by limits to free acct . But Prem. Us only 10$ Worth that and then sum! Awsome, only thing is if dont pay cant skip tracks or choose whats playing can get frustrating to think of song search it then cant even play right the np",0
So much good music app good performance and my favourite song is Sigma,1
Awsome there are a large variety of songs and it has loads of options like when to play this or that,0
I absolutely love Spotify best music app out there my opinion only tho. Keep up the great work,1
New update completely ruins the experience: - restarts playlists randomly once the app is exited - playback menu disappears half the time,0
Every update requires that I reinstall the app in order for it to work properly and it will mess up any alarms linked to the app. Stop making things that already work worse!,0
Very good songs and sound quality,1
Worst app. Keep on pausing a song. I have to click the play button 100 times and I am tired of this. Update this app big time.,0
Really like it. Awesome selection of music.,1
"This is my experience: open Spotify press play. Sure i can hear my show, but the control buttons will not open, so i can't pause or skip or anything... but close spotify. Now my show goes quiet, then i open spotify again and it's the same thing all over again!!",0
"I get this trash for free from work. Won't use it because of all the hate, and misinformation Joe spreads.",0
I bought premium for a reason to download songs and not listen to ads thankfully the ads are gone but when I download a playlist its downloaded but when I spend some time off the app then open it again random songs are just not downloaded anymore.,0
Wonderful songs apps,1
Worse..freaking.just to play mine playlist..its tooms hours to find and once it does than.. its only for.5 second and other.songs starts to.play that wasnt on the list and they gets full songs...i.dont understand music app playlist thats like a head and face ..so why ..another thing is it never.stops..always on.background. I am seriously like. Really amazed and.confused how this app became so popular....weird,0
50% of the time the app crashes when you start a podcast. Genuinely one of the worst apps I've ever used. It just crashes all the time,0
Bruh hate the update I should be able to lesson to the songs I want not have random ones in my playlist play I want to be able to lesson to them all not Spotify randomly chosing one I hate this update so much pls Spotify get rid of this up date ! It's horrible worst than sound cloud rn,0
Decided to leave because it can't stream music quite some time although phone is connected to Data/WiFi. And the song options are quite few and it's algorithm of playing songs is weird(keep streaming same songs).,0
"If I wasn't paying for premium, I wouldn't be this irritated with this app. It crashes and freezes all the time when I'm playing music and when I'm not playing music and when I'm online or trying to play downloaded music offline. Get it fixed Spotify!!",0
Great app for music. You can lock screen while listening to Spotify without having to pay. YouTube app you have send money to unlock that feature.,1
It really good but entire it was ðŸ‘Ž good because it didn't have the song on everyone time,1
No much ads Tooo much ads,0
"Dear Spotify, I think Telugu movie music is incomplete without the songs from the movies ""Sagarasangamam, Seethakokachiluka, Meghasandesam, Sithara, Kokilamma"". Why don't you add these to your music? Why????",0
Try to open my spotify then its crash. Everyday. Why? I already update and uninstall and reinstall. Still happen the same,0
Ok it's great but I have to pay inorder to skip songs,0
Love it music for all ages,1
Not displaying current song being played. Can't use on multiple devices at the same time.,0
the new update sucks. it logs you out from time to time and it's just so glitchy.,0
Easy to use Wide variety of options,1
current version 8.6.98.900 still has issue with showing correct metadata on car radio while connected using bluetooth... I would love for this to be fixed... otherwise great app,0
"It keeps telling me that I need to connect to the internet to use ... even with my mobile data on and connected to internet. So, I haven't been able to use it. I can't even click on a podcast or anything without the ""connect to the internet"" screen coming up.",0
Had this for years but after the last update I haven't been able to use it on my phone at all,0
Been able to listen to music that I haven't heard for years thank you Spotify,1
"Loads song lists with songs unrelated to my taste. Biggest issue, promises 30 minutes with no adds and then gives 10 to 15, repeayedly!",0
"I find it unfair that in my iPad and PC you can loop and skip songs wtv you want, but then my phone that is an Android can't just because I don't have premium?",0
I think that Spotify is good but it doesn't have so many songs that I like but is still good,1
Horrible interface. Kept trying to make me use a old account I no longer have.,0
The music starts skipping and pausing when my phone screen is off,0
It's very buggy and has to be repeatedly restarted regularly to fix problems with the UI. The playlist feature seems intentionally designed to make it difficult to put songs onto multiple playlists. It's sluggish and the algorithm is often incoherent with anything but obvious genre.,0
Love the app mostly of the time. Sometimes it glitches and will play songs (just a segment of the song over and . Sometimes it'll have two or three songs playing at the same time and I can't figure out how that's happening but for the most part I really like the app,1
Love using Spotify. I get all the music I love n I be vibing all day. The only thing I don't think I like is once am out of internet I can't use the app,0
Best app for listening songs,1
"It is super annoying when you get a notification of a recommended album, you tap on it to listen and it plays one song from that album and then the very next song is from something else. Example...Hans Zimmer Top Gun album/playlist notification came up. It played one song from Top Gun, then jumped to Kung Fu Panda. If an album or playlist is recommended and selected, then it should at least play only songs on that list first, then transition to other related material. Going back to Pandora!",0
best for update ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ and waste your net first and second play song i am listening the song but 1 min ma update i am open app crash ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,0
Way too many back to back ads. Haven't even listened to a full song and had to listen to 3 ads.,0
The app really sucks its so glitchy and takes so long to load anything refuses to download my liked songs and for the quality of the service it is far too expensive but im too lazy to change apps and find all my music again,0
"The app is overall okay. But it stays only on okay. Interface is simple and not something special, I belive it can be more beautiful.",0
This is the best app for music,1
"With no excuses , this is the best app for play music .",1
"The app has had way too many issues recently. Just plays the same 20 or 30 songs in a loop instead of the whole playlist. I've had to force stop spotify just play my songs somedays, and I love listening to music while reading comics or playing mobile games. But now the songs will stop randomly, not pause, completely stop. It gets on my nerves to restart songs and especially I'd the song was on a good part. At this point I wonder if I'm paying for problems instead of a music app.",0
"I love it, just hate when songs are unplayable...like y? Other than that. Great, 8/10",0
This app is so good for listen music This app is good for listening offline,1
"I love that there are so many artists that I can add to my playlist that aren't mainstream or don't have radio play. My issue however is that lately, old songs that I've added can't be played anymore bc they have been grayed out for some reason.",0
It will not let me listen to music only little 5 second Snippets of the songs,1
FIVE STAR,1
I like to have music to listen to when I do chores or work and this is the app I use,1
Worst podcast player and several annoying layout decisions.,0
would be neat if this app could show lyrics. and hate tha I've gotta save the whole album when I'm in fact only need one song,0
Spotify is a verygood app I listen songs and very well songs,1
I jus don't know how to brief about this app as I'm just love with it... I lov having songs in my ears while writing my QnA of Subjects and in also I hear it in my mean time. The only bad side is it can't support downloading songs untill paying monthly/Annually. Btw Everything Is Great in this music listening app.,1
"I don't know what is wrong with the app, it was fine till I updated my phone software. It is okay if I listening through my laptop, I think the trouble was not my account but the app itself. I rely on Spotify to listening music. I hope I can still use the app by phone since I use the app most of the time in it.",0
"I only put it to 4 stars because when I add it to favourites and play it the song is just short, and I hope you guys do an fix it cause I now only use it ones a month, and I love the app",0
You can't view all songs on artists page ?? Why??? Not very easy and intuitive to Traverse in app,0
Uninstalled. Can't stop the app from spontaneously opening and playing some of the worst music imaginable.,0
Love the app and the Company!!! Way to go Spotify!,1
"Very bad experience This is in case of Android users. If you search for a song and try to play it, it goes on shuffle play and you don't have an option to song which you searched. Terrible experience",0
This is a really good app for listening to your favorite songs and podcast,1
Nice and easy to use.,1
"Being a premium user for years I can say that most of time the app has been reliable and useful. But no more. It is changing and the user experience is quickly deteriorating. Some of the issues: 1) EACH time I start it up, it asks if it can use Bluetooth. No matter how many times I confirm it's OK, it will ask it over and over again 2) Currently playing song and/or playlist becomes unaccessible when clicking ""home"" / ""search"" or ""library"". Extremely annoying. 3) When listening music while you're not using the phone, it just stops randomly. Sometimes after a 30 seconds, sometimes after 2-3 minutes. Those issues are relatively new, I never experienced them in the past. Depending on the evolution I'm afraid I might need to decide to turn to another music service.",0
Totally confused about switching phones so it sucks,0
I love Spotify and I've been using it for about 4 or 5 years now but recently when I'm trying to add songs to a new playlist it would let me hear the sample of the song other than that I find the app very useful.,1
Apps garbage. Cant play any song you actually wanna listen too.,0
Has the greatest variety of music from my favorite band(s)..a lot of Grateful Dead to enjoy!!,1
Best among any other music app,1
Ads are way more frequent than every 30 mins. Otherwise great app,1
Yes on my phone no skips (other than 6 an hour) but on my computer (which is mobile) I can skip what ever I want. On my phone I can't just pick a song but on my computer I can... I love that it will load about 5-10 songs before it goes offline... witch is great in my car,1
"Fantastic music service, been a user for probably 8 years now and have always put the user first. New integrations are always a benefit and haven't had any issues.",1
Good service terrible app. It worked really well for a while but over the past it will just either not load quickly it will not react to input. It'll go 20 seconds before playing the song I selected and skipping doesn't work sometimes. Really annoying to have premium and have so many technical issues on the app. It will also just randomly stop my songs or won't let me seak on a track. Works fine on my computer but just not on my phone. I tried reinstalling and clear cache but nothing helps.,0
after hearing you guys lost 36 episodes of Joe Rogan yeah that's what you get two stars,0
Best music app!,1
Let us play one song at a time! We Don't want to shuffle for the playlist or listen to a whole bunch of songs and plus when we have a playlist you add new songs to it it sucks stop doing it! Just get rid of that stuff and let it be normal again please!,0
This app is okay but it's kind of got too much going on in it. Hard to really locate stuff. Premium is really the only way to enjoy Spotify,0
Play/pause button keeps freezing. The only way to stop playback is turn your phone off and on again,0
Absolutely awesome....surely a must have app,1
"Latest update is causing serious issues. Can't see the control bar without multiple restarts. If connected to the car, music won't play unless I speak to Google at which point it plays while google's listening to me, but the app doesn't even recognise that it's playing. Someone messed up and it needs rolling back.",0
"I used to love the app but when I search a song and play it, another song plays. In my playlist I don't want previews of the songs want to play, I want the actual song. Please fix this.",0
Won't allow me to upgrade to premium online or through the app. It's tough to make any money that way.,0
"Holy damn, it's getting worse day after day, and btw the ""free"" use it's a joke you have previews now, too bad. No king rules forever.",0
The notification center for the newly released music isn't working since the Spotify went down that day.,0
Not very reliable. Freezes quite often and lags a lot,0
I use this app for everything and have done for the past five years. But if I pay for premium I expect issues to be resolved and they're just not. In fact they're getting worse. First the app would crash in the middle of listening. Now the players on my lock screen and drop down bar are no longer there at all. I need all of these issues fixed to give it a higher rating.,0
"im gonna give it 4 stars for rn because of the ads. Amazing app but whenever i play an album or song, i get 3-7 different ads and it fets really annoying. im not planning on buying premium either because i dont want to. and also i have a request. Why dont you make the spotify app for phones the same it is as the web player or tablet? i want to change my songs directly without shuffle mode or going to the next song in my playlist. please consider it but overall great app",1
Love it easy to use...great selection of songs,1
I love Spotify becuse it shows all the songs im looking for.there recomendacions are the best.i hate when there is ads but apart from that Spotify is the best music app,1
An amazing app for music of different genres and for what you like,1
I like having music on demand rather than radio. My music when I want it.,0
Spotify is great for finding music related to searched artist and saved music.,1
It must have updated or something because now I can't choose what song plays in my Playlists it's all just random and now there's ads. I was ranting thank you for reading.,0
Site says they fixed the now playing bar but it's still gone,0
Just now learning how to use it I love it my man only use a Spotify so I thought I would try it out and I'm loving it to,1
"Difficulty pairing spotify with devices on premium duo, customer care not great ðŸ˜‘",0
Really good app. But I feel bad for aritists,0
I need help on cancelling my subscription from my other e-mail. I've been paying this app twice a month because I used two of my email to subscribe. I don't have to pay twice of â‚¬6.99. So help me cancel from one of my email,0
Frustrating! When you pay for something you expect it to work. *The (play fwd etc) interface disappears regularly. *app is really bad at suggesting new music based on previous likes.,0
Android app lacks many of the QOL features in the iOS app. It also consistently stops playing audio at random when listening via Bluetooth.,0
It was good at first but then I searched the song and it gave all playlist.The searched song was not coming,0
"What happened?? It used to work great, and now some podcasts or music content simply will not play. I wait and wait and it wont play, I go to another podcast, plays fine. Even certain episodes won't play within a podcast, and some will. Very glitch now and we pay for premium so it's very annoying that we don't have accessto content now, and randomly at that. Sometimes the control bar doesn't pop up and I have to exit the app and go back in for it to pop up.",0
Shuts off every 30 seconds,0
This is a great app for streaming music but sadly I don't have premium yet,0
"Was great until their June 1 update. Now, there are too many ads and too many songs that I didn't add but are based off of what I listen to. I'm fine with the ads but if I want a song added to a playlist I will add it myself and not have forcefully added by a bot. Some would say just to skip it, you're right, until you run out of skips. Then there is a constant pop up promoting Spotify premium. So you are now stuck listening to songs that you didn't add (and probably dislike).",0
"App has gone downhill almost overnight, with no feedback from the devs on how they will fix it.",0
Android and Playstation apps are so buggy. Completely unable to view my Year Wrapped up and my apps stop working and crash. The issues are never addressed and their customer service is 0 help. Shame it doesn't get the support it deserves,0
"Only played what they want to.Wouldnt let play a song I wanted. Works ok on my tablet,not on my phone",0
"Over all i like it alot One of the things that need help is the random setting,when it plays certain songs over and over But other then that great ðŸ˜‰",1
Great app has a lot of great music super easy to access I love my Spotify.,1
I LOVE IT THERES BEARLY ADS AND I CAN FIND SONG THAT I WANT RIGHT AWAY,1
"""Spotify is trying to play"" Seems like every new update makes the app more unstable. Why is this extremely high-profile app the ONLY app on my phone that still gets frozen with audio playing audio, requiring force stops? Why does the ""now playing"" ui disappear so frequently? Why is the gesture behavior different on songs with videos attached vs regular album art? Why is it so difficult to manage your library, especially when the automatic features are so inconsistent?",0
Best app to play song..... I am given this app 4 stars because in this there is the best song what ever songs we have heare we can listen songs from this app And 1 stars - because of ads,1
"Htt Teri maa ki ,,,,jio users don't download it's doesn't work properly on jio sim",0
"Used to be a 5 or 4, became a 2 with the newest update. Completely lose all jurisdiction other your liked song Playlist and how you listen to it, lose ability to add songs to queue, lose access to rewinding a song, finite numbers of skips in a row without premium. Overall horrible.",0
Good song collection n best application for listening music ðŸŽ§,1
Spotify isn't working on my device,0
You should be able to cancel your subscription from the app.,0
"Changes so much these years... Used to be a good app.. Ads is okay. But idek, it just feels different after these years...",1
"Video constantly fails after the app hasn'tbeen used for awhile. Normally removing it from recent apps and restarting it fixes this, but not always",0
Spotify has a great selection of songs... it's just super hard to play them. There's so many little bugs that are only ever so slightly annoying but they all add up to be a real pain in the back.,0
"Recent update destroyed all smooth functionality. Doesn't show what is currently playing, continues playing when disconnected from speaker etc.",0
Pairs with the truck before start ðŸŒ„ drives.,0
Very good experience I can turn Spotify on my favorite music and listen to it all the way from Virginia to New York never have to change the station never miss a beat Spotify is great,1
Conitued billing after account cancelled. Still an ongoing disput months later!,0
Guy's I've never downloaded this yet but just by reading the comments it seems bad but if u don't find Spotify appealing then just use YouTube music it's good I've been using that and especially for ages 10-over will like it I'm 14 so I would like a good app to listen to music on. Bye!,1
Its good but sometimes it doesnt load the music or it plays like 8 seconds of a song then stops and it says no wifi/internet connection when i have it and it just diesnt work at times but when it does work its great.,0
"If you have premium, which is definitely worth the price, it's the best music app there is.",1
Always get such good music recs from Spotify,1
"Amazing app. Very limited ads, I've probably heard only 2 uptil now. It shows the lyrics, most of them are timed. The music is very nice and it lets you form a playlist.",1
Great music. All types Commercials one or two that's ok the music makes up for it. ðŸ¤¨ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤¤ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ§ðŸŽšï¸ðŸŽ¼ðŸ”ŠðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŒðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½,1
"Absolutely love the app, the appearance is spot on and there are heaps of songs to choose from! Maybe there could be a themes setting so you can change the background because that would be cool ðŸ˜Ž",1
It's cool but for subscribe rAs who had to for some reason haved to stop you should have some kind of fringe benefit with listening for short time it will make them be more app to come back and not try another music place,0
Spotify is a good apps for listening good music... excellent!,1
The best of streaming music apps. My favorite thing about Spotify is how it automatically extends whatever Playlist you have been listening too with the same sort of music.,1
This app is perfect! It has so many songs on it but the problems are that u need internet and it has so many adds,0
Easy to use and great to listen offline,1
Gust a good song app,1
Bug. Music being played doesn't show up anywhere.,0
Spotify has always been my goto for my music needs!,1
"keeps crashing whenever I skip songs, please fix",0
Surprising,1
Great app for music having a wide range but some features should be free Like replaying songs and non shuffle. (Free version) But overall spotify is a useful app for music offering high quality for a affordable price. (Premium),1
"the app constantly stops responding, forcing me to restart my phone.",0
"I've been having an issue lately When i play a song the bar with pause & play doesn't show up any more in the app, it even disappears from my notifications so i always have to close spotify & reopen it",0
The best music player out there .it beat Al the others hands down You will enjoy it,1
Love it and I will recommend one of the best I've ever seen before I would choose anything else this is the number one playlist of all times I wouldn't ask for other app Spotify is the best I go to sleep listening to Spotify music if anybody ask me what music app I listen to I will tell them Spotify is the best of all times and yes you can dj this app with out changing a song it plays all the songs you want to hear and if someone gets a other app beside Spotify they ain't doing nothing with out.,1
Very good app for me and then new songs are available am like it but ads are bad experience but I m very comfortable for this app,1
"I'm annoyed. I have used Spotify for a while, and it was great up untill maybe a couple weeks ago, because I think I remember updating, and now every two song there are like three ads. I didn't download this app to listen to non stop adverts, I downloaded it to listen to music. I hope the developers can make it so that there are less ads. thanks!",0
First of all I had to make a new account because it wasn't giving the option for mobile login. Then now when I play a song on shuffle or normally after every skip it reaches the first song I played and it's frustrating seriously,0
"Update 2: still incredibly annoying. If you can't figure out how to embed ads, then don't do it. Great being 45 minutes in and have the podcast stop then have to start all over and find where it stopped. Note to advertisers, I'll never purchase your product for this reason. Update: Still incredibly frustrating. All the same issues. A company with the resources of Spotify should be embarrassed to have something this poorly executed as the platform for podcasts.",0
"Hey Spotify Team...the latest version is severely unstable...stop play by itself, have holes during reproduction,(regardless from WiFi or mobile connection...plus the songs are generally stored in the device) I used heavily the app in the last 4 years and that's the first time I ever had an issue, please look into it. Samsung Galaxy A70",0
Spotify is better on ever platform phone is garbage you can't chose what song you like and you can do that on other platforms,0
"Amazing, has many playlists of your choice to choose from",1
"I don't know why but when my mobile lights get off ,it stops playing music,I guess it's crashes.so uninstall it.and please delete my id",0
"2 1/2 minutes of ads and I quit, don't know how many there woild be.",0
Nice song and Simple play list,1
Top class experience not minding the advertisement,0
If you buy premium you will recieve no add but if you use it for free there are songs between the advertisement ðŸ˜‚,0
Collection of songs are good,1
Id give it a 1 star cuz 1 I cant play my songs on order 2 I cant skip or go back to a part i like 3 EVERYTHING IS PREMIUM,1
Sometimes there is no option to pause the music this happened on my way in to work it turned back on so I just turned it down no pause button available. I also can't open the option pay for two people and change my plan with no customer service I can't call anyone. If there is something better I would definitely change apps.,0
It has so much good music and old music it might find whatever your looking for,1
Best song app ever(premium version) with wonderful recommendations of new songs... with one flaw which bothers me a lot.... sometimes even when I'm online... it shows me offline and no songs are played.... wherein all other apps are running smoothly on internet,0
I cant upgrade as I've tried premium before,0
"Now it stops when you open another app. Music keep randomly stopping this is on a playlist I have downloaded, also app keeps crashing AGAIN. I cancelled my premium because of the problems before. I can't see me keeping it as not much has changed, always problems",0
Too much ads now a days. So uninstalling the app.,0
It's great because you can sit back and relax Wyle listening to Spotify,1
"So how come I can't look up a song and just play it. Seems like no matter what I search, if I play a song it will give a different song with it's own playlist. That playlist will not include the song I searched.",0
love the simple way to navigate and enjoy free content,1
Fantastic range of songs and artists to choose from. Exceptional music library. Highly recommend this app.,1
App got terrible recently. Plays music but does not show the controls (Pause etc.). Need to kill app to stop music.,0
I had used iheart radio for years. I will no longer use iheart due to them pushing their GAY agenda on their users. I got tired of gay ads every 10 minutes. I switched to Spotify and hope they are better.,0
I love my music and will continue to utilize spotify,1
It's really hard to pick what song you want to hear next and I like the old way,0
Exceptional,1
I'm a bit frustrated with the settings. It always seems to be running unless I force close it. I don't want it to autoplay when I turn on my car and yet it still does with auto-start denied and spotify connect turned off. Plus the battery manager says that it is running for several hours after I stop playing music.,0
Best sounds awesome ðŸ˜Ž experience with Spotify! ðŸ˜,1
Best app for every song,1
To many adverts..after every 2 songs.. think I will uninstall it. From me 0 starsðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,0
The app is great but I can't add songs to my liked songs. Please fix it,0
Amazing,1
Love it because lots of good artists to choose from,1
"Bugs after last update. Play without the play bar, can't control the music unless I hard rest the app. It happens frequently",0
"I liked this app until this morning ( Jan 5). I was going in to listen to my music and the app looked very different. I can't listen to specific songs, can't go back to the last song. I don't know why this is happening already deleted the app ad got it back. Nothing changed. I also didn't have premium so i still don't know what's happening. Please fix this. I also did not have a free trial.",0
Great music!!! All kinds are awesome!!!!,1
There are so many ads and its shows no internet even though my internet is on,0
"The app is great, but I do get sick of black and green",0
"Excellent app for home speakers, phone or TV.",1
Your app and website is not working for airtel SIM card users(india). Please fix the problem.,0
Please let me just listen to my song cause theres ALWAYS an commercial or ad pop up of nowhere like can you remove that like you wants us to buy the 3 month free listen no and dont force we can buy it if we want to my god and theres another problem when i go to my like songs and then i play shuffle song and suggested song pop up like you fix that??!!! WE DONT WANT TWO OF THOSE SO PLEASE FIX IT RIGHT NOW!!!!,0
Spotify has been great to me for a long time but this new update my app constantly crashes. Doesn't play music or just stops music randomly. Fix the last update,0
Love it . There when I'm In need of a familiar sound to match my mood,1
"This app is the best for music, i love listning to the Beatles in a car ride, tho ads are anoying very anoying. This would be a 5 star rating but it says enjoy ad free music for 30 minutes.. 3 minutes later another add",0
I BEEN USING THIS APP FOR A LONG TIME AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.,1
Just constantly recommending podcasts to me despite not using it for podcasts. Can't stop it and it's now useless for discovering music and much more frustrating just to get to music.,0
Look guys there is no better music/ broadcast app then this this is the best app you will ever get when it comes to music especially your favorite artist and lots more and so if you guys never use this app before I would recommend it 100% the best at you will ever get when it comes to music and all you got to do is pay five bucks a month,1
I'm so glad you chose to keep Joe and get rid of the 1960s has been that today's kids don't listen to. I'm a child of the 60's & never really like Neil's music. Thank you for not being apart of the cancel culture. Makes me appreciate you more.,1
My favorite app. No need to look for CDs anymore. All music at my fingertips.,1
The app pauses several times with every song and frequently shuts down entirely.,0
"It was perfectly fine until the last update. Ill click on a song and it'll shuffle to something completely different?? And I cant click on a song I want to listen to before I shuffle my playlist, Istg im just going back to youtube to listen to music",0
I think Spotify is great and easy to use I just love it.,1
This app is good very nice songs and ad free I love this app very much â¤ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ‘,1
"Please bring back options to block artist, songs and languages. I'm really tired of hearing random German. Nothing against Germany tho, I love you guys!",0
"Had 5, went to 3 star per putting long ads in my own Playlist. Was a lot more excited about this app when I first got it. Leave the ads in new stuff, but for those looking for an mp3 player...get a different app or an actual mp3 player.",0
"An easy 5/5 for me, I hope one day you can add music videos to the list tooðŸ˜Š",1
My phone is not getting updates in onr id what all this is happening And why is this happening if i login to my other id it shows lyrics and all other features wotk properly plz sought out This as soon as possible,0
"Happy with the paid service, aside from prices creeping up every 5 minutes. Obviously artists demanding more than minimum wage in line with inflation I guess. My real gripe with spotify, is the free version is only worth listening to if you don't mind adverts every 2nd song, making it more irritating than radio dj's. As a result of this passive aggressive sales tactic I'm now deleting spotify.",0
I love your music a lot. I listen to the program every day ðŸ™‚,1
"I create a Playlist and I can't play song from that Playlist, because Spotify plays other song than that one. Wowowow way to go guys.",0
"I mean, what can't be bad it's just music lol",0
This app will not work on an LG v30 everything is normal except music will not play keep up the good work with the terrible updates Uninstalling!!!,0
Shuffle sucks. Everything else good,0
good app but constant ads and unable to listen to what I want without shuffle.,0
Having issues will play music with out a play menu won't let my change songs constantly crashing been Having this issue for the last couple weeks constantly having to go and force stop the app to make it work right,0
"UPDATE: Music doesn't play when phone's blocked. Near unusable! Since the last update the currently playing bar at the bottom keeps disappearing. Same for the widget it doesn't work and you can't control the music anymore unless you quit and start it again. Very bothersome, not what I pay for",0
Broken ad script on Rogan podcast makes you listen to unskippable ads then restarts the podcast so you lose your place. Dangerous and frustrating when you listen to podcasts in the car and it randomly does this to you. Why am I paying for licensed content if they're going to force unskippable ads in my face in the first place? It's sad because they could be the number one publisher if they just refused to censor content and kept it simple.,0
The app has been having some technical issues lately. It crashes often and the play ticker sometimes doesn't show on the lock screen or even in the app. It makes it hard to pause a song. The app seemed to work better before the latest updates,0
"Loved this app for so long but nothing but problems since the last update. It stops playing all the time by itself, doesn't recognize that it's open, I have to clear it from my tabs to get it working again.",0
"Like the content. App now crashes often, content stops randomly, or the app doesn't completely open allowing the user to use the controls.",0
"Horrible app. I use it for songs of course but i cant get rid of suggested songs. Even if you turn off the suggested songs, it wont work. You only care about money and your apps becomes useless after this. Whats the point of making a playlist if this app just replaces your songs with suggested ones. I still use it but im having troubles. Delete this app if you dont use it. Its not worth it, ads and suggested songs are annoying. ""Just buy premium"" No.",0
Really liked the app. I mostly use it for podcasts. But lately it crashes everytime I start or resume listening to podcasts. I just updated the app and im looking forward to see if it got fix. Could also just be my old phone. I hope Spoftify eventully integrates comments on podcasts too. I think it could benefit creators as well as consumers.,0
I love this app â¤ï¸. It is really great I have been using it for a long time now (about 5 years.) I really love how it gives you a daily mix. from daily mix 1 to daliy mix 7. So it kinda has to get familiar with you.,1
"Definitely worth 5 stars. I have over 350 songs stored on my phone, but eversince I discovered Spotify, I don't even listen to my own music anymore. The playlists that are created contains all the music I love.",0
"Just now I installed the app . I select the and I pressed the play button, the app automatically closed, it is repeating again and again .",0
It was good at 1st then I tried other devices besides my galaxy phone everything sounds extorted man it made me think twice was 5stars but now it's definitely garbage I rate one star in I might have to go back to my YouTube music account,0
world best music ðŸŽ¶ app all best music ðŸŽ¶ nice app,1
New update has made me unable to connect to Spotify on my pioneer car stereo please fix this!,0
"I like this app, but it cuts off after approximately ten minutes of listening. Also, a separate little box that allows you to play, pause, fast forward, and rewind disappears, so I have no way to stop it from playing other than closing the app. I uninstall and reinstall at least twice a day. Tried contacting support and after 2+ hours with three different people in their online chat, there was no resolution. Very frustrated.",0
The Spotify,1
Enjoy the music so much and particularly the ease and using this application and the wide selection of artists,1
consistency proves to have worse functionality than ipods had 15 years ago. stop pushing podcasts on me. stop breaking simple features with bloaty bullsh*t.,0
It has all the good music i like,1
Best music app ever also highly recommend premium if you can't afford it get duos and spit it with a friend,1
Ive come back to Spotify having left for sometime after being unhappy with the user experience However I decided to come back based on the cost Vs experience of YouTube Music and Im glad I did Audio Books now included better layout AI DJall fantastic Youll have me for a good while nowIt looks great neatly laid out and a far better user experience than my previous subscription,1
Pick a song they play 5 before the one you picked. Why do you do that?,0
"Perfect but you're only flaw is, and I'm sure you've heard this a lot before yet it never changes, but you can't download only one song unless it's been put off in the discography as its own single release. Otherwise I would have given five stars.",0
I listened to music streaming,1
"I have used it since 2011 and I'm fed up. I really dislike when they change the app in unnecessary cosmetic ways so as soon as you get comfortable with it or they've worked out glitches, bam fresh new hell. Just leave the podcast section alone already it was fine years ago.. I don't need to download and add to Playlist, dont need two sections for new podcasts and ""used"" podcasts, just put it automatically in one podcast folder I can sort. Duh. And f*** embedded ads that glitch or I can't skip",0
Last update is gay They moved the skip buttons and the play button to the left of the screen it's pretty darn stupid tbh EXAMPLE: â–¶ï¸â®ï¸â­ï¸ When it used to be like this â®ï¸â–¶ï¸â­ï¸,0
"I'm having problems signing in and I've tried everything to solve this, I'm so pissed right now 1 month without new music.",0
I love Spotify its just the ads are anyyoing. Also I love how u can find songs from tiktok on here and sped up songs,1
"Very good, a excellent range of music from live recording to album's and podcasts.",1
"I honestly cannot figure out how to use this. I have three decades of experience in IT, and this UX is utterly baffling to me",0
spotify is one of the best apps I love to use they have ever song you are looking for good job spotiii,1
"Have always had good results in accessing the podcasts that I have wanted to hear by means of Spotify. I have yet to try using the app to access music, though.",1
ðŸ‘©ðŸ»â€ðŸ¦¯I wish Downloading song and Offline Mode Had Better facilities....I am not able to Download/ Listen to songs Offline...Plz Make this option enable... otherwise It's all wonderful app love it!! ðŸ’œâœ¨,1
This is very good app so it give it 4 star but one is problem is that it has many ads and permium is so costly,0
Very nice music being played. I enjoy it everytime.,1
Awesome best music provider in my opinion plus if you do the the surveys you could win premium which I did and it's great 10/10,1
"I love when Spotify actually plays the songs I want. After the LONG ads (I've actually used a stopwatch and got 4 minutes of ads, and it would have kept going if I didn't close out the app) Spotify uses shuffle and puts on a song COMPLETELY unrelated to the playlist I want to listen to. The only ways I've learned to listen to songs without shuffle or paying for premium is by listening through the celebrity mixes. Basically saying your not gonna be able to listen to your songs without paying.",0
"I have used spotify for years now and ive always been satisfied with what it offered but since the latest update, it has got worse. If I want to create a playlist, I no longer can play ""a bit of the song"" to see what song it is because mostly, you dont know the songs' title. Please fix this!!!!!!",0
One of the best music streaming app .,1
"Coming from deezer it's been a disappointing experience. I like the enhance feature, but I miss swiping down the playing panel",0
Best app and best collection and selection of Songs,1
Crud cant even listen to a full song might as well go back to yt music Fix it so i can listen to music!! ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,0
Music whenever you want it on multiple devices.,0
Great music app!!!,1
Edit - From 5* to 1*....is it a music listing app or add listing app....just disgusting sooooooo many adds,0
"Plss fix your app, it's hard to use, what the heck, all the songs and playlists shuffled play I can't even play the song I want because it's shuffled even though a song isn't included in the album There are also many ads Plss fix it ðŸ˜¢btw I'm not angry I just asked for a little request on spotifyðŸ¥º",0
Horrible interface and constant repeat of unselected songs.,0
This app is ridiculous it doesn't accept any debit cards for a free trial in India It always shows payment failed Not expected this from spotify,0
There is a lot off songs u can pick I listen to Spotify a lot,0
"idk if this is an update or what but suddenly i have a limit on how many songs i can skip? what is this a technological dystopia? i cant even play the freaking 2 minute song i want without paying? what next, we pay to open the stupid app? what is this corrupt bs. this is stupid and only backfires, and companies only do this bs because theyre rich enough to. i literally just want to listen to music, and all i get is ""so sorry you weren't satisfied but we actually dont care""",0
I easy choose and record the song i want...,1
Spotify is one of the best app in which we can listen all type of songs,1
This sucks on phone wont play the songs on playlists this app is better on tablet,0
Very nice app for music,1
It is best app to hear music.,1
"I dont understand a two thngs : why, when i start listening to some albumn, random songs(completley unrelated to the author and albumn) are starting to play? Why do i have only 6 skips per hour, it's ridiculos, you are playing songs that i dont want to hear and I can't even skip them",0
Good,1
"I work in a windowless basement that barely gets any type of signal. Luckily, spotify comes through and music saves me from going nuts.",0
Went with Pandora instead smfh. The ads are so bad. At least Pandora shows the ad on the screen instead of playing it over your music. I uninstalled because they wouldn't let me skip a song after I disliked it. I HAD to listen to the song. So yeah nope. Pandora doesn't do that.,0
"The only problem is that if you can't spend money on premium membership you have to see so many ads , I don't earn money I am just 13yr. Old my , so there is no way I can buy Spotify premium membership, if Spotify wants to make this app no. 1 I will suggest to minimum the premium ads.",0
Spotify please fix the bug where It keeps playing music and I can't pause it. I can still play music but the controls won't show up. It happens when I use spotify for more than 20 mins. Only way to fix it is to close app and open it. I have s22 ultra if that helps.,0
Always has the music I'm looking for and great recommendations as well,1
Couldn't ever be without my spotify.,1
It's a wonderful and fabulous experience and I'm very excited listening to Spotify music,1
It's good but when I playy fav song it play other song that I don't like and it makes me mad because I tried it hundred times but still it play other song,0
Latest update is causing playlists to halt halfway through a song and then quit the playlist. Very annoying!,0
"Pushing Paid subscription every time a launch the app, over it...",0
Its is good at first but I dont like the fact that everyine has to pay for stopping the shuffling,0
Glad to have spotify,1
Super music in this appo,1
Friends' activities are never visible. Even after all the required settings are turned on. Many more bugs to be fixed :(,0
"Is it necessary to show ads after every 2-3 songs every single time. And not just one, they show 3 ads continuously.",0
Pretty good with music but poor podcast controlls and glitches a lot. Disappointing,0
I love Spotify especially because I have premium it's only like $10.30 and it charges every month straight to my card I love Spotify,1
I like this,1
"Unless you are planning to pay for Spotify premium (which is a really good service) I wouldn't bother downloading this for the free version, it is incredibly S H ðŸ‘ T E! You can't play an album in sequence, you can't even choose a song from an album, it will shuffle it about and play whatever it wants! I was listening to the Zutons first album and it tried playing justin timberlakeðŸ¤¬ also I think there is more choice and less adverts on YouTube, may as well use that instead of free Spotify!",0
I enjoy every moment of the great & variety of all the music on Spotify.,1
"Edit: burned through 7gb data because it keeps forgetting my SD........... Sick of it. Old: What's the point of downloading to an SD if the app just forgets? Can't tell you how many times I've opened the app only to have no access to my own music. Won't recognize its own default path to stored files, usually have to just redownload everything when back to wifi. It recently bugged to only show 5% of my liked song library, forcing a reinstall. Is this better than an ipod?",0
Absolution perfect! The music of the world at your fingertips tips!,1
I really enjoyed it. Especially it's premium feature helped in getting entertained even on my trips and flights. So it's a thumbs up ðŸ‘ from me. Please download this app guys.ðŸ™‚,1
Friendly and easy way to listen to our favorite music.,1
"I like spotify, it's easy to sign up and has a wide range of songs. the main problem is that when i open up the app it freezes and crashes. another problem is that there are a lot of ads. it says listen to this ad to get 30 minutes uninterupted, but after like one song which is about 2-5 minutes, another ad pops up.",0
Oh come on.. I just update 5 minutes n there is notif to update spotify again?? Are you crazy??,0
"The latest update is full of bugs. The app now lags..and doesn't respond, please fix it",0
"It won't stop auto playing. I can go weeks without using the app, and if I press play on my ear buds to restart the song I was listening to in another app, and what happens? Spotify starts up. I've deleted this app multiple times and nothing changes",0
Love this app a lot but it's REALLY speed down these past few months. I have a brand new android phone so it isn't my device and Spotify is the only issue. My friends have the same problem. An amazing app but the large load times just to open my liked songs is getting irritating. Otherwise I couldn't be happier with this service.,0
One of the best music streaming app I have came across.,1
"Like it but I don't know why they decided to take off the feature where you can listen to like a preview of the song when u click on ""add songs"" now just have to add them blindly and hope they will match my mood a bit dispointed.",0
"1 star right now due to a bug with the play bar. Doesn't appear but music/podcasts will play, and I can't control/pause anything. Must keep screen on as it auto pauses after about a minute if it's off with this bug as well. Will go back to 5* once fixed.",0
Lots of music available easy to use great Playlists,1
"Great listening ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘, all my old favourites!",1
There is no option for rearranging the library songs please give that option to rearranging the library songs on Spotify,0
"App is so buggy now, it's time to cancel my premium family plan, what good is it when it randomly stops, plays wrong songs, takes forever to load, and half the time the controls aren't displayed",0
Ads are good bcs tells abt new songs which are beautiful but smtimes it's is not good bcs u r listening ur fvrt song,0
"If you are looking for a music app I would highly suggest Spotify. It has so many genres but not only rap, r&b, pop, rock, etc but it has different categories in those genres and you can also see the latest singles or albums that have been released. I would suggest to get premium bc of the amount of ads you get. Also they have 2000s music, 90, 80, down to 50s. I like how there's albums from music you've listened to that maybe you haven't heard in a min or while.",1
I have been using it for a while now but now it just SUCKS idk if it's just me but I can't play my playlist with the new update IT SUCKS,0
Terrible!! You cant change the songs! You can only skip songs only 6 times per hourðŸ˜‚ and songs you liked will be played the same way plus it shuffles between them and not by order,0
Had the worst experience with this app on my phone. Literally can't have the same feature I got on my computer. Can't play my selected song peacefully without dealing with automatically chosen song and suggested ones.,0
"App no longer works properly for me. I can start music or a podcast but it stays on a blank home screen. Doesn't show what's currently playing at all. Also can't pause or interact in any way with toolbar. The only way to stop a song or podcast is to completely close the app. Cleared the cache and checked for updates but nothing. The last time Spotify worked properly for me was when I paid for premium, which is interesting. The only thing stopping me from deleting is that Pandora is somehow worse",0
"Having issues with Spotify all of a sudden! Songs keep cutting off, or it'll keep playing but showing that nothing is playing. I love this app, it normally works. Please fix!!!",0
"I really like Spotify, but the only problem is that you can't listen to music without internet, only with payment, and we have to understand that sometimes we don't have money or 4g to listen to our playlists in places without wi-fi",0
App is rubbish constantly stops playing. No play bar for over a week. Awful app.,0
Will always be my # 1 favorite music app ðŸ–¤,1
These app is good,1
"I have been a premium Spotify member just over 10 years now. Any time prior to the last couple months Spotify was a 5 star app any day. But since the turn of the new year the app has become almost unusable. At times it can take up to 10 minutes to load a downloaded Playlist. Search results wont load. Constant connectivity issues, while on data and wifi, the list goes on. At the moment I do not recommend anyone waste money on this app. Hopefully something changes soon, or I will be switching apps",0
I have no problems it gives me the music that I need and the music that I like and the music that I haven't heard in ages Plus I can have my whole family on the monthly plan at an affordable price thank you Spotify keep up the good work,1
"If you want to be a free listener, then don't get it. You have limited skips and you can't pick the songs you want. I would recommend Pandora.",0
Advertisement is the big problem when hearing a song,0
The update is just a no and I can't even Pick what song I want to hear anymore and it's annoying so I hope you can fix this and turn back to the old version,0
It is the best song app,1
"Hi! I use Spotify from 2020, and im really excited about it! There's really user-friendly interface, so many songs and podcasts. I like thus app very much! When Spotify imposed sanctions, I was forced to switch to Yandex music. I don't like it like Spotify, BUT: there's a mix ""my wave"". It give you really great tracks. If you add something like this in Spotify, I will be very happy!!",1
"Everything was fine before, now, for a month when I listen to an album sometimes it goes into a loop of four songs that keep repeat. Please fix, I pay for this app 120 â‚¬ per year, similar bugs are not acceptable. Not fixed yet. 13/05/2022: It was partially fixed, but it came back the same, really, you put back random play for playlists and artists, what's wrong with you?",0
Super,1
Favourite music in an instant!,1
I want to listen to the songs that I have put in my playlist not songs that Spotify has put in there I cant even listen to my songs in my playlist Fix this please,1
Spotify is good and all but you can't skip ads and they just throw ads after a few songs. When the ads pop up it NEVER ENDS. Too many ads. I'm dying and seeing an ad is HELL. Please fix this.,0
"It has always been fine, but since last update need to press 3 times in a song, and plays randoms songs that are not in my list, and songs in queue just don't play at all. Also it crashes when screen is locked, really bad now ...",0
Such a Better App than YouTube Music. Because in YouTube Music there's so much ads! Such a Hassle! Good thing that Spotify existsðŸ¥°,0
Can I enjoy Spotify without Spotify adding unwanted music to my Playlist? It's rude If I wanted the song on my Playlist I would add it. Don't need Spotify adding songs that I don't like.,0
Best app for listening music ever !,1
Very cool app because I can not getting back With Another Event and I will be there at about the same as the one I have is a good time to come by and look at your schedule,1
Spotify is the best app ever you can listen to any music and I've been using it my whole life nothing can beat it.i would give it 100/10 if I could,1
Listened to all my fav music on the go.,1
"Crashes every time you skip 3 songs now, like down to the exact moment.",0
They don't send any notification when your subscription is almost over. Just take your money sneakily.,0
"I've been having an issue where I'll start playing something, but the ""playing now"" module doesn't appear. Which makes it impossible to bring up the ""playing now"" interface. The workaround is to close the app and open it again.",0
I really enjoy the music variety.,1
"I've seen so many music apps, but it's having multiple of features, we can enjoy all through, I loved it ðŸ¤©",1
Lot less ads than the other companies,0
Its very weird i installed it and it was good now i go to my liked songs literally plays 30 secs of the song and a ton of ads doesnt even play the chourus playlist is so bad i have so many songs and i have not listened to it i dont know what happend it was good but now its really bad,0
Very Happy with the Spotify music app lots of great features and music and podcasts to choose from.,1
"Unable to Pause Music after latest update. I don't know what happened, tried uninstalling and reinstalling and still the issue persists. I have to force stop every time to get it to pause the music",0
I love this app however I rate this a 4.99 since they do not allow it on later than iOS 13 and my daughter wanted it on her iPod touch and she cant but other wise awesome app!!!!! <3333333333,1
"Great app, however it was recently bombarded with ads. Also it should be able to loop podcasts.",0
"Poor user experience lately, it doesn't show any play-bar so I could control a play and it's very frustrating, I have to close the app every time I want to pause a song and re-open and find it again when I want to play it - instead of having the pause/play option! Plus I can't move on different times of the play so if I want to go back to a middle of a podcast episode - on Spotify I just can't! Is it going to be fixed?? That's embarrassing consider tha apps cost and how fundamental the feature.",0
I'm a premium user and can say this app is so buggy it's insane while listening to podcasts they constantly restart and i have to try and figure out where I left off because when it does restart it also marks the entire podcast as played so you have no clue where you left off on top of that since the new update i can't access what is actually playing on the app at all it doesn't even say I'm listening to anything and I'm unable to pause unless i close the app fix it I'm sick of paying for broken,0
Excellent database & search facilities. Also offline use & crossfade on windows desktop app. Unlike other streaming services. Only downside is still no cd quality or high res available. Unlike other streaming services. Come on spotify lets have it please.,0
I really love it. I use spotify everyday! All my favourite songs are in this spotify. So I would like to hear it everyday whether I'm free or busy. If you guys want to hear a songs or podcast you can install this app. It's really amazing.,1
"Downloaded app for Rogan and experience has been great, be better if Neil Young was gone, keep platform unrestricted for all content providers. Do NO evil...",0
"The range of music is great, but the premium is overcharged",0
It has all the songs that I need I dont need to use YouTube anymore this is the best app for music,1
"Advertisement every 2, 3 songs not as promised evey half an hour",0
"Ok, what is wrong here? The new ""improvements"" are really bad! The person in charge of removing the interface for instant stop and play and other simple music listening functions, just in the bottom of the app, really has to rethink the results! Fix it! Edit: in my anger I wrote this before installing the update. Actually really fast fixed! It's fine again.",0
The best online music app evet and its free!!!,1
"I'm using tidal but I thought I would try Spotify from a free trial with Xbox gamepass. To me, Spotify seem way overpriced compared to other adjacent services available, offering no Dolby Atmos or high quality audio at similar cost. App has issues sometimes it plays songs after disconnecting Bluetooth, sometimes crashes and would randomly resume on occasion. I think Spotify relies too much on pseudo value from pop culture marketing, it's questionable business with subpar business model.",0
Had to uninstall Spotify from my device on account of the constant repetitive commercials. Consistently hearing the same commercial THREE TIMES IN A ROW was the final straw. I'm going back to Pandora,0
"Says I'm not connected to WiFi when I clearly am, couldn't search for songs. Last time I tried using app, it took over my phone. Not cool as I'm going into work & couldn't get it to stop with normal effort. Not worth the hassle for me.",0
"I really, really like this app alot so that I can listen to music at at all.",1
The recent update put the pause button all the way to the left of the screen along with the skip back and forward button. The skip back and forward button are right next to each other and very small. How can one expect not to click the wrong button. Who thought that would be a good idea?!,0
"am very happy with Spotify , I can enjoy my lovely music every day ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜",1
"The best app ever,you won't regret installing this app .You can find every songs that you want",1
Not to bad. Just needs less aids!!,0
Going to uninstall i try to play a song but when it start That is not a song i want to hear its totally different i think this application can't handle this situation,0
A good app. Only that I don't know how to download audio music on this app. Can you get me through it?,1
Spotify is the best and greatest music of all time It has amazing singers My favourite is Shawn Mendes,1
"Seriously having the worst experience with this app, first it didn't sync my music, now the player never shows up! I find myself closing the app and opening it right away just so I can actually see the music player in the app and even on my notifications panel, and I mean EVERYTIME after the revent update. It's one bug after another, I'm really thinking on moving to another service.",0
"I really don't understand how one of the biggest music apps on the planet can be this buggy. Frequently missing the ""now playing"" tab at the bottom of the app, which means all controls (skip, pause, etc) are missing. Randomly says ""no internet connection"" while clearly connected to the internet and streaming. If you search for a song and play it, then let it autoplay similar songs afterwards, you can't go back and listen to the original song without backing out and selecting the song again.",0
"....... Then last week, i slipped into pressing Sputify instead of the right entented Tab. Anyways, my inadvertent mistake brought me into a new level of ""User-Friendly"" Spotify experience that might also excite you, when you deliberately enroll your heart and ears to a never-ending living experience, during your life-time.",0
Great and good music A wide variety of it to But to many ads,1
Works well and customer service is great,1
Playlists messing up not doing what they are supposed to in ability to restart playlists but I I've seen it work before so I am very disappointed it stopped working,0
Very good but can't use it without data even it OWN bonus don't work until you have data,0
Extensive collection with great recommendations!,1
"Daily use, not every song imaginable but a wide collection nonetheless",1
All Favorite Super audios are available @Spotify,1
"Avoid the free version at all costs. They have gone to great lengths to make listening to specific songs impossible. Not only is there no way to turn off shuffle, but spotify will also add similar songs into the mix, forcing you to skip whenever these come on. That is rather annoying by itself, especially when driving or otherwise occupied, but in case that wasn't bad enough, there's of course also a limit on how many times you're able to skip. The design is openly hostile to the user, avoid it.",0
Ive been using spotify for about a year now and im desperate to switch off from it. Paying the low cost of 10$ ive learned is not worth it. Downloading content is unbearably slow even with the audio quality set to low. Ive tried multiple devices and its all the same. Would not recommend spotify to anyone,0
Best music app hands down!,0
It's easy to safe and play my favorite tunes. I have been able to hear and save everything that I requested to listen to.,1
"Best music app so far. Recommendation system became very smart. ðŸ‘ Using premium subscription now, to support them.",1
I love it it never fail great Playlist it worth every penny,1
"Spotify is a great app, however it has a few hiccups. 1, it's ads for the free version. The ads are a nightmare, instead of 1 or 2 every 30 minutes. It's 3 or 4 every 15 minutes. 2, downloaded songs have a little downloaded emblem in the playlist. It disappears sometimes and having a 100+ song playlist is a lot of storage space. With all of that, Spotify is a good app. Premium is almost required but it's only 9.99 a month. I love the podcast selection they have too. There's something for anyone!",0
The play menu button disappears when you stop playing the app and mimimize it. I have to close and open the app just to access the play button. Please fix,0
Absolute trash now. Seven consecutive ads before I can listen to my first song? No thank you.,0
This app is a disaster now. Constant crashes and bugs. It will refuse to play downloaded tracks while offline. Or even bring up track listings. I don't know what I pay so much for this service for when it just seems to get worse with each passing month.,0
"Recent problem where app does not show the player, so can't pause, check queue etc. Have to restart phone (Android - Samsung Galaxy) to get player back, but it soon disappears again.",0
This app is great. On the pc app you can skip songs unlimitedly. You can listen to as much music as you want each month/week for free with minimal ads.,1
"Annoying. The app will randomly start playing music while you're sitting in a meeting. While in your car, it continues playing when you shut off your engine. Lot of work to do on this one. Considering I had this same problem 2 years ago, I don't expect much to change.",0
"I like Spotify, just sometimes have User issues, trying to get a better handle so I can use in my car easier.",0
"I am bts army I should this app is very good and songs many. More I have to choose on bts ðŸ’œðŸ’œ songs ..you should your favourite singer song .. song is best quality ... You are army girls . Bts ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ and K-pop song in available in Spotify........ Bts soul song Suga ,jimin,jungkook, v,,Rm , jhope,Jin, all members rap song in bts soul song in available in Spotify .. good app in very ...............................................................................................................",1
I've been a premium subscriber for 10 years. I LOVE Spotify! I've never had a problem finding what I like to listen to. The app is easy to navigate and user friendly. They definitely have something for everyone. I am a happy Spotify customer!,1
"Everyone always recommends this, but the songs that can be listened to are not as many as YouTube Music. Sometimes you can only find the cover instead of the original song",0
"I really enjoyed using this app. But, can you add romaji lyrics for japanese/korean songs? I'm pretty sure it will make it easier for people to enjoy music more. Thankyou â˜ºï¸â¤ï¸â€ðŸ©¹",1
Convenience. Can listen to all genres of songs. A comprehensive list of artist and singers both old and young.,1
Had it for 2 years now will never stop paying for it the absolute best music app period!,1
"Music controls(play/pause, next shuffle etc) have disappeared from the app, developers, pls see the bug, basic feature is missing",0
"I used to love Spotify. But recently, i havent. My playlists only let me plag them on shuffle and i hate that as i have them in in the order i wanna hear them. Then the 6 skips per hour i hate as well. I skip a lot of songs but there should be unlimited skips. Please fix it.",0
"The music that you like, all through those road trips where good stations are nowhere to be found.",1
"Okay, but just because you need premium to turn off shuffle mode, it's not gonna make you earn money, it's driving people to the point they will uninstall Spotify.",0
All things are best but ads are very much. Which can irritate a user who used to listen sometimes.... Please improve it ... it's a humble request from your true user ðŸ™ðŸ™,0
"What the hell i can't login to Spotify i have tried login for free, login with phone number , login with Facebook , login with email but it is showing something went try again later what the hell my mood is off",0
So very nice is spotofy app,1
"service was one great, now they are censoring content, they now suck.",0
"I say to them that I want the app and they make me download it I'm so happy they are so kind, I love them, they are so sweet.",1
"For my liked songs, it doesn't let me scroll through the different categories/genres.",0
"Im on paid subscription but i can't keep this shuffle button off, whenever i play, it will automatically turn on. I uninstalled the app, clear cache and log out on all devices but it is still on.",0
Galaxy S21 + .....Music has now started to stop/pause for no reason during playback. Have tried everything and still continues to happen.,0
Too many ads as compared to other music platforms..but yet again less than youtube ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ,0
Best music search and curation experience!,1
I've used other music apps and Spotify is my favorite out of all of them that I even got the premium version I already have a huge music list and I like that they'll recommend songs to you base on what you like and if you make any Playlist you can enhance it and Spotify will add songs that's similar to the songs already in that list,1
It's just i can't understand why I could've listened to a song and the next day it's name is faded and it doesn't want to play,0
"Per other recent complaints, the playing track isn't always visible so can't skip, other times it stops playing. This is happening very frequently.",1
Good to hear that nice music,1
"The app is great, been using it for more than 4 years now. But suddenly I was logged out and am not able to login at all on my samsung s20 fe 5g. Will appreciate and rate 5 starts if it is fixed",0
I love Spotify for the large catalogue and the easy navigating . Also I receive recommendations for other artists that I may never have experienced. It may be my best purchase ever !,1
"Recently the music just stops playing all the time, and sometimes randomly starts again. Sometimes my controls (play/pause button) disappear now. So disappointed. I used to love Spotify.",0
"Very poor experience, every time I just open this app my temper got high. Like, the song I want to play I simply click on it but instead of it any random songs plays from it's playlist and if I want to change it sometimes it changes or sometimes not. You better tell me the solution or fix this problem please. Idk how people like this app and use this. Please co- operate with it, it would be a great help. Thanks.",0
Unsecure security threat! :( unfortunately everytime without fail I get a notice that someone has logged into my Spotify. No way I'm ever putting my payment information in for premium again this happens daily. Tired of changing my password just to have the same notice multiple times notifying me that someone from another country has logged in again. If you want to keep your customers enable Spotify to play my paid for music on any platform and please fix security.,0
Not good selection of music and artists.,0
Enjoy the ability to make any playlist I like,1
"Awesome app, just awesome, especially the blend feature.",1
"This app's updates are increasingly making it worse! The songs are very good even without the Premium version, but it makes it so that you will need to purchase it! Advertisements after a song ends once in a while is not that bad, but the main issue for me is the playlist customization. I can't rearrange songs, the playlist is always shuffled and sometimes it even plays songs that aren't even in the playlist for no reason! You can't even replay a song and it has a limit on skipping songs!",0
Are you looking for commercial's? Spotify has lots of commercials. Also commericals are so much louder then the music it actually hurts my ears when they come on compared to the music. Updated 01/13/22... sooo many commercials.,0
uninstalled worth it,1
"I enjoy listening to music through this app, especially when I play it with the song lyrics.",1
Its not working . I have proper internet connection then also it doesn't work...always a message pops in that internet connection is not working,0
"I Will Provide detailed Review Later, But Overall It is my most favorite platform for listening music online and offline, getting more useful features in app now a days. Good Work Team plz keep it up.",1
"95% great. The only issues I run into are when in areas of no service, often times it doesn't let me play the music I have downloaded to the device",0
Excellent App. Having great collection of songs for Christians.,1
It's easy to use and also user friendly,1
Variety of tastes in music and songs I love and remember.,1
It is so good l can play Roblox and listen ðŸ‘‚ to music and you can listen to MSA when I saw that I was so happy it is amazing download it NOW it is just that it will start to freeze In the middle of a song and when you turn of your phone when you turn back on there wil be a different song it is really annoying because my phone ðŸ“± updates alot,0
"When I first got Spotify it worked absolutely fine, but lately the songs that I have been playing haven't popped into my notifications, so I have to go on to the actual app to pause or skip the song, and sometimes the song randomly stops and I have to go on to the app to play the song again. Does anyone else experience this? It's been really recent for me. Edit: Now my Spotify is working completely fine, don't know what happened though.",0
Very good no problem Best music app My favorite app ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
Wonderful music app. I love the new music Spotify finds for me. Thank you.,1
It's fine. Just wish they had a list of my songs listed from A-Z that was separated from the comedy albums.,0
"app is buggy as all hell right now. last update was alright, not as bad as the current. spotify randomly stops playing, and sometimes when i play a song it wont appear and i cant control anything in the app. and this happens very frequently",0
"I love Spotify, but the latest layout change is too much. WHY CHANGE SONETHING THAT WAS PERFECT? AHHHH!!! Don't make me use YouTubeMusic, I might like it more.",0
"Great music selection, however the ease of use for the listener is not there. The little things like not being able to clear the queue of the the playlist you were playing and not being able to and random songs to the queue dampen the experience of the app. Also the lack of response to helpful suggestions by the developers is also a problem.",0
"i hate the Ads, literally 3 ads in a row in every 10 minutes, PLEASE FIX THIS",0
"I have yet to look for an artist, or a song that they don't have. Wonderful free music app.",0
"The apps player window keeps disappearing randomly resulting in having to crash the program to get it back. The review podcast option never allows a review because it states I need to play a few first before I can, but I've listened to every episode on my phone. The most annoying thing however is I work in areas to little to no signal so I download podcasts and music, but Spotify needs an active connection to produce the list of my saved content which defeats this purpose making it useless.",0
"For about a year I had no problems but recently songs that I had not added to my playlist started playing they were not in my recommended songs either, I even looked in settings but there was no way so stop it from playing songs that weren't on my playlist idk if its just mine acting up but I don't like it",0
My Spotify app keeps on interrupting music. Esp when i use it outside. What could be the problem,0
Amazing but a little more like YouTube ðŸ‘,1
It's an awesome music platform,1
"Love the app, but bring old sessions back >:(",1
Amazing,1
This app has become incredibly buggy of late. If I try to open a podcast it keeps taking me to my homepage. Other bugs recently which affect playback and not being able to search through. 12 year user but actually considering leaving at the moment.,0
"Easy to use . it's all there.any type of music, sound available.",0
Its complete music and perfect application,1
This app is to good.and very easy to use there are only few steps to use this app and the best part of this app is why i rated this app five star is you can make your own playlist and you can make many playlist in this app and one thing more app that I used in my whole life this was the best app and a feachere that I liked is the search option that is also good in fact this whole app is best for use and i liked the whole app and this was my opinion on this app i think you who is reading this,1
Can you guys fix this app in such a way that i can download a single song without necessarily downloading the whole album which i only need one song from?. By the way it's a nice app but pls consider a download button for a single song.,0
Full of ads ðŸ¤¦ðŸ½â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜¡,0
Paid for premium and can't play a damn single music. Keeps on crashing after pressing the play button. What an app. Will give zero star if there was an option.,0
"It has been working really well for me, you can set it up to play the way you want it to , i be using the sleep timer at nights i love it!",1
"Its very informative that Joe Rogan chose Spotify as their main residency for their podcast. In my own experience, Spotify is the worst app I've ever used. Everytime I have to use it I despise. It keeps crashing. I use a s21 ultra phone There is no reason I should have so many issues with this all alone.. Of jre did not switch, I wouldn't usr Spotify at all. Spotify. Just improve your UI and stop sucking",0
Spotify is a very good place to listen to music but it's not the best without premuim. But on the bright side premuim is not very expensive and in fact quite affordable it is a clever business method to earn and I'm down for it,1
"The songs will not show in created playlists, only the artists. Also won't work with searching. Was fine on my tablet but just installed it on my new phone for convenience and was very disappointed.",0
"Hey, it was amazing app but after a month the app frequently starts closing, fix it otherwise I am going to download another music app.. Thankyou ðŸ™‚",0
Every songs are here best app like instagram and also BTS songs are here each and every,1
"instead of playing a playlist or a song, the app will just play a random playlist. or play random songs that have nothing to do with the playlist and aren't even on it. then ads will loop forever instead of playing once and getting back to the playlist. completely unusable",0
I'm so happy that Spotify told like 6 other apps that I like all this music I've never heard of. I'm so happy Spotify then tells all my devices play that music I've never heard of. Most of all I'm so happy I left Spotify 4 months ago so I don't have deal with it.,1
Im on premium but ever since it updated I cannot access spotify on lock screen while playing. Its tedious to open my phone just to switch the song ðŸ˜© please fix it,0
"Doesn't even launch the app from my phone home screen just crashes my phone, I have to go app store and run it from there. I have to use vpn set to USA to listen to anything at all it seems. I also can't use Wi-Fi as nothing loads when I do, when I try to play some thing it's takes literally minutes to start, the delay is so bad that I can't even pause things it just keeps playing. Recommendations suck Â£10 a month for this 5#!Â¥!",0
Everytime i try to start a Playlist it says something went wrong,0
Best music streaming site and very user friendly,1
"I still have 2 month premium left, but can't use it. It was a good service though.",0
"The App keeps saying I'm offline every single time. I've tried ah available methods but still. To be honest, it's very irritating. You guys should a way to fix this considering the fact I've seen a lot of people complain about this problem.",0

"I love the variety of all content. I think that variety essential to any modern platform. However, I donot like any form of sensoring, including pop-up politically motivated, so-called, warnings.",1
I prefer the online version to the app because its annoying when you have to search i have to click the button twice to even search something its okay for like a day but longterm i would not reccomend,0
"The app has some serious issues at the moment and is basically unusable, as a premium member I hope this gets fixed very soon.",0
I just love having access to all types of songs that speak to my current situations. Love being able to download and listen even when I'm away from home. My alarm is linked to Spotify and my mornings start with the best melodies,1
Good and easy to use,1
I thought this app wasfree and u couldplay any song on ur playlist nope you cant and u only get to have 6 skips,0
"The best, any music any style you'll find it here",1
"I love the app. The new update is so good. Personally, as a music lover, Spotify really helps me to listen music at ease. I took a star because of those ads in the Free version. Those ads are annoying and Premium got affordable",1
This app is so annoying! Everytime I tell it to play a playlist it just plays different songs I don't want and you can't even turn off the recommended songs thing! Please fix this because this is impossible and annoying to use because it doesnt play your playlists and adds songs to every playlist you make which is annoying! Please fix this!!,0
I love the music on my playlist and I hope they make more soon,1
"Diverse and huge amount of music available anytime,anywhere.",1
I give 3 star because of i logout my account at night and in morning i try to login but i can't because of i forget my password and reason behind i forget my password because I'm using since very long time then i go with mail that also not happening sometimes too many attempts sometimes network is not working I Have Premium also even then this happening what can i do now please resolve this problem ASAP,0
"Pretty good, but it's crashing a LOT",1
"The app is getting worse and worse. It stops playing and starts playing again after some seconds when the screen is locked. From time to time you have to start to play manually. It also doesn't show the current playing song after some minutes. Only a force-stop of the app helps. Very sad, as the songs/playlists are great, but the app performance is really worse!!!!",0
Queueing issue. Connection issue - both bluetooth and casting.,0
Love but i hate the boring ads 4/5 ads came at a time.,0
"Worst app. Can not play any song. When touch the play button, nothing played. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž",0
Its good but we need the option to play songs before we add again,0
It's wonderful app...I have just been using it for a few weeks and I truly find it easy to access and find songs and it has lyrics at the same time . Love it,1
"Love this app, but occasionally has a problem where the music just stops. I can tell it's malfunctioning today because the song playing is not updating in the preview bar. Galaxy S21",0
I only use this for podcasts. Unless you have premium thats all its good for,0
Hate this app. Worst app ever. So many ads. Extremely annoying app. So many restrictions except for Premium Users. DESERVES NO STAR!!!,0
"This is the best app I've been looking for. I don't have bank account, is there any other way I can try for premium?",1
This app has a very big flaw. Very often the playing track progress disappear and your phone just playing eternally till you restart.,0
"It's great! Nice blend of music according to your taste, with the exception of the ad's...",1
Oh I really liked to can use this app but it doesn't work for me at all..my problem was because of using vpn and I couldn't use it without vpn either! ..idk why it said turn off your vpn..I got a little sad :),0
Not as great as apple music but yeah better than other music streaming apps,1
"Not only it's laggy, it's making laggy other apps when I'm using it. And yeah, it's this app. It doesn't happen with other ones",0
Songs have started to play and not let me pause and stop once I've clicked it.,1
Non stop problems with app crashing or it just starts skipping songs and podcasts. Also after you listen to the ads it will glitch and start the ads over again several times. If it wasn't for Joe rogans podcast I would have given up on this app a long time ago,0
Review for Wear OS app - great but I wish the player showed album art while playing a song,1
The continual updates to features no one asked for while never adding other basic features like library sorting is frustrating but its better than it used to be,1
Newest update screws up the background playback. I just get a notification that Spotify is trying to play when reopening the app after pausing the music. It's so annoying as I have to force stop the app to be able to play music again,0
"Keeps crashing, opens without playback controls, crashes phone sometimes when plugged into Android auto.",1
It keeps replaying the same songs multiple times. So that's kind of annoying. Prefer if it just plays every song in the playlist at least once before playing a song a second time. Is my music though so I can't really be mad about it as much lmao,0
User interface isn't customizable and Spotify doesn't care what their users want. Another company that doesn't respect their paid users.,0
Too many adds,0
I love Spotify an I want it back,1
Love this so far! ðŸ‘Œ i only use a few times a year....i just dont have the time.,1
"I love Spotify, its my favorite app where not only i can listen to my favorite music but also podcast, I really do recommend it and there is all free of course if you don't want to hear commercials there is always the premium",1
Best Music App I love it â™¥ï¸,1
"Hi i like this app i mainly use this app for listening to music.. i've seen people sharing lyrics, i want to share lyrics but i can't i've already update the app but i still can't share it(not up to date). Please fix this! Thank you",0
Was using YouTube red and I'm SO glad I made the switch to Spotify!,1
I like the app but every time I try to get on another app it shuts down and wont let me back on,1
When I play media it almost never has the pop-up player. I have to force close the app to get it to correct.,0
I took premium just to listen podcasts on spotify but there is video podaat but don't have audio podcast feature online and it sucks my limited internet data very fast. Please add feature so we can listen audio podcasts as well Please,0
It is an amazing and absolutely satisfying app. It saves data as it don't need much and because of this reason I can listen songs after my data is over. It is also easy to use but there is one thing which disturbs the most and that is ads.The app shows too many ads. The ads are coming after every time. Please do something of ads. I hope you can do something with ads. Otherwise everything thing is perfect.,1
Great.(I am very weak on English. So I don't know how to share feelings wealthy. Sorry.),0
I can find specific versions of songs that I can't on any other music streaming service,0
"I prefer everyone to Choose â¤ï¸ resso â¤ï¸.. Beacause First of all Spotify was working amazingly!! After sometimes when I open the app it says internet connection is not available, am I look like a fool and this app without turning on the internet connection this app is getting waster and waster and waster..... Please choose â¤ï¸ressoâ¤ï¸",0
Spotify on mobile is super trash i cant even change the music i want,0
Recently won't show me what I'm currently listening to and randomly stops playing songs on Spotify premium,0
"After update, unable to play 'liked songs'. It keep playing 'liked suggested songs' instead..",0
"Just to listen to a couple of short ads, I get to listen to, what is arguably, the greatest Live Album ever: The Allman Brothers Live at the Fillmore East. It just doesn't get any better.",0
"keeps crashing, music will play on its own sometimes, but won't display in the notifications panel",0
"I literally use Spotify every day! 100% worth the price of premium, they give daily music recommendations that are actually condusive to what I like, and I'm pretty picky!",1
Excellent app and content,1
Good app,1
"I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline.",0
Slooooooowwwwwwww and constantly breaking. Instead of making it look pretty why don't you fix the bugs?,0
"Such a simple requirement as being able to play more than a few songs in a row in the background, without having the app pause/freeze playback seems basic, but unfortunately Spotify is not able to do this (even without any restrictions in android and even with downloaded songs). Have to open the app constantly and switch to next song just to be able to resume music playback. Sometimes opening the app and waiting for a while also magically starts the playback again. This is simply unacceptable.",0
I use spotify everyday and keep adding to my playlist! Limited ads and I easily find artist and songs. Highly recommend this app!!,1
I like that I can just pick whatever song or album I want.,0
One of the weakest app I have used in my life after every song there is advertisement like come on the guy who invented this app and the way he is running the advertisement on it is a very stupid brain grow up its 2022,0
I can't listen to music with premium only 9 or 10 seconds or none at all,0
It was a perfect music app until I updated. It's lagging and randomly stops playing. Why? ðŸ˜• I'm not impressed with the new update. Kindly fix it.,0
It's the best music app but the only problem are ads.They are long and very annoying ads....,0
Tons of great content BUT the app itself leaves much to be desired. It runs terribly most days. Downloaded episodes while on premium still pause and randomly crash. The interruptions are extremely aggravating,0
"Wow! A free music streaming app! Sounds great! Except it gives you loads of adverts if you don't buy premium for an overpriced Â£10 a month. I'm walking along and it gives me a thirty seconds as. No problem! Then another. And another and another. Had to listen to five ads this morning before I got to the music. Another really annoying feature is the inability to select just one song, you have to listen to a whole playlist and that song isn't even at the front. Try to find it? Youre out of skips!!",0
Good but allow playback,1
Great app for every genre of music,1
Why it always Closed everytine i open and play some music? After i paid the premium package then the problem is up,0
Love using Spotify it's just I hateeeee the ads but I don't wanna have to pay just to get rid of them other than that I love everything about it.,1
This is a very good app We can hear the song such like cool songs chill songs Romatic songs that like so many types of songs I love this app  When any time i like hear the song first i will take spotify And when i am writing something i will hear the songs from this app and write Also i hear the songs from this when i am boring all this thing why i am saying i love this app This app is very helpfull for me  And i am saying thank you for the founders of this app,1
"This app was fine,until the new update came,when I choose a song,it plays another song that I did not pick,also the timestamp became useless,I do not recommend using Spotify,YouTube/YT music is way more better,please fix this! Or else I will move to YouTube music",0
Always excellent..... Good value for money....,1
Spotify stops playing completely or won't stop until I close it completely in the background this is frustrating it ruins the flow of my drives.,0
Laggy and doesn't open,0
Love Spotify always a playlist to change a bad day into a good mood. Ooh r set the occasion with the perfect playlist,1
Always had a problem with Spotify. It takes ages to load between menus regardless if I have the latest version. I try and delete the cache which speeds it up but I have to constantly do this.,0
Spotify premium makes my life so much better.,0
This app doesn't let me skip the songs and add additional songs to my playlists,1
Love music and finding songs . I just up graded to premium !! My Son always told Me Mom do it . He's since past and I'm loving it. Thank you Boy-Boy ðŸŒº,1
You can only skip 3 songs ever hour,0
I would love to see things like when the song was released at the credits section.,1
I WANT TO SKIP AND LISTEN BUT THE OPTION IS LIMITED OTHER THAN THAT I L9VE IT,0
My favorite music streaming platform there is all the songs you could ever want on it,1
"Wow I left pandora because it would stop playing music by itself after 5 minutes, now I come to Spotify hoping it would be better but it's literally the same thing. You'd think you could provide proper staff to fix these proe.s with all the paying customers",0
Although some of us need to know how to update Spotify in our countries,0
Its good so far its alot of songs i like to listen to ðŸ’¯ðŸ˜ŠðŸ™ƒ The only thing that gets me upset sometimes is when you want to choose a song and you cant...i think that should change were you can pick a song off the playlist ðŸ˜­ðŸ¥º,1
great app for playing ads but sometimes it interrupts with songs.,0
Amazing ðŸ‘ just sit back and listen ðŸŽ¶ fap,1
"It's really good on my tablet. No issues there, everything works with no problem. HOWEVER, as soon as it comes to my phone it only let's me view 30 seconds of a song. What's up with that? This really annoys me as what if I just want music on the go? This isn't just a brand of phone issue either as this has happened on my newest phone too. Please fix this or let me know if I need premium for phone usage. thank you",0
"I paid Â£10/month for listening offline, and is not playing my play list anymore. But still pay Â£10. I will cancel it now. Not going to pay for nothing.",0
"I love this app. That is all I can think of. It is better than most of the music apps I use, and I can listen to all my favorite songs. 10 out of 10",1
Its a good app but ads could be reduced. I noticed that there are a lot lesser ads on desktop app,0
Works well in car and car picked up via bloothtooth automatically.,1
It's a great app highly usfull and easy,1
"music great, accounts are a nightmare. been paying for family, now duo for months, my wife and I can't listen to different things at the same time. tried logging in and out separate accts, been on forums, lots of people have these problems. Ridiculous. A year of paying an one of us has to listen on the free version with commercials. This should be easy. shame on you spotify. Update: problem solved. I divorced my wife. Now saving $3 a month. That should cover the alimony in about 2,700 years.",0
"After the update, Unable to play the songs of my choice. Only shuffle mode works which doesn't even play all the songs from the Playlist. Another issue is tht only 5 to 6 songs can be skipped per hour. ðŸ˜’",0
Awesome app ðŸ‘Œ no ads,1
Latest update removed the ability to quickly scroll through your liked songs,0
Very Good app,1
"JOE ROGAN IS A RACIST DROP HIM. They acknowledge there's a fundamental issue with downloaded songs being deleted at random. They admit it's an issue exclusive to Spotify but is actually an issue with how ""phones handle file caching"" and that it's something to complain to your phones manufacturer about. No other streaming services have this issue. This has been their stated answer for over a year for an issue that has forum posts from 10 years AGO.",0
Spotify better than resso,1
The best music app in the Market right now.,1
Best music you guys love it thank you,1
Very nice application spotify,1
"Can anyone explain why my play/pause button is now all the way to the left, while my fast forward / rewind buttons are to the right? Why isn't the play/pause in the center anymore, between the fast forward and rewind like it used to be?? Is this a glitch??",0
"It was a good experience, however after updating the apps 1 day ago, the performance is worst. When I listen songs and podcast it randomly stops itself.. I know am using free version,but it doesn't mean the performance will slow. Not many people can afford premium.",0
Excellent app never let's you down I love it highly recommended,1
Best app ever but you have to keep a option for downloading music...so please keep the option... So you will have more public to come,0
"Great place for podcasts, smooth interface",1
I have a complaint . Spotify app will be not working on my device please clear the complain sudently .,0
Ads are embarassing for a free user ðŸ˜…,0
Great app love it I can listen to songs with my phone off but Spotify adds songs to my playlist which is so annoying,0
"Its a great app but I genuinely hate the fact they took away to preview songs, And the ads have been getting massively out of hand. I get like 5-6 in between 2 songs.",0
"I have had Spotify for 3 years now and with premium it is really good because you can listen ad free without having to be on the app, my family uses the family plan and we all use and love it",1
I love spotify. But sometimes it doesmt show the play bar at the bottom of the screen or notification in my notification center which makes it super annoying to find out whats playing. I also cant pause or skip while that is happening. Ive talked to other people about it and the same thing happens to them.,0
Best app for music full stop,1
The best platform for to listen to music on:),1
I love it app I like it soo much Listening to: Spotify 01:43 â”â”â”â”â—â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ 03:50 â‡†ã…¤ ã…¤â—ã…¤ âšâš ã…¤â–· ã…¤ã…¤â†»ï»¿ Ä±lÄ±Ä±lÄ±Ä±lÄ±Ä±lÄ±Ä±lÄ±Ä±lÄ± á´ á´ÊŸá´œá´á´‡ : â–®â–®â–®â–®â–®â–®â–®â–®â–®â–®,1
Love this app,1
I really like it this app,1
You dont have control over the songs you want to hear and that's supid,0
This is by far my favorite app to stream music and podcasts. I no longer use YouTube or pandora. My only complaint is not downloading this wonderful app sooner.,1
Cannot stop the autoplay everytime I get in the car and my phone connects to the Bluetooth. I have to uninstall.,0
When I'm thinking I want to play a song I don't think of Spotify because you can't play the song that you choose without paying for premium. I tried to play one of the songs I chose once and it brought me to something completely unrelated.,0
Very annoying app. Every time I opened the app it would pop up a useless request or recommendation with no option to turn either form of spam off. If you're just looking to listen to podcasts use Google's podcast app!,0
Good ape,1
I shouldn't have to have premium in order to have an actual UI. ever since if canceled my premium I have no UI to skip or play songs. I have to close out the app in order to pause a song or podcast. This is ridiculous. For your app spotify do better.,0
All my liked songs disappeared after this uptade. I have the premium but the service it's a trash because don't most my musics that is the basic,0
Constant crashes with endless login problems. Now it has removed all my playlists and I have absolutely no idea what to do. It keeps giving me errors that I have no internet connection and I have to admit this is extremely frustrating. However this is the best music app ever made definitely worth premium.,1
Just what we need all our favorite song in one app,1
"Not as much music for my taste, so can't exactly recommend. Otherwise, if it has your music taste it's absolutely excellent!",1
It's great I love it had it for a long bit but lately it's been crashing on me while I'm listening to music also sometimes my liked songs won't pop up even if I download them for premium,1
Very bad I got continuously 4 ads ...ðŸ˜¢ Around 1 min there must be some limit on ads you can't show it however you want I only listen music on Spotify. But this disappoints me.ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢,0
The group listening sessions seem to be flawed and nonsensical. The previous code scanning worked very well.,0
"I like spotify on computer and not mobile, always put the track that I dont want instead of the one I do want",0
"Great to find albums and songs that a person can't find anywhere else, not even on YouTube.",1
"Keeps crashing? I've been a dedicated Spotify user for years but for some reason everytime I scroll through my songs in my library to listen to and when I swipe more than once, it crashes and sends me back to my home screen. I deleted the app and reinstalled it, cleared my data and cache and it still does the same thing. If it keeps doing this it has to be on YOUR part. Please fix it or I'm movimg to a different streaming service.",0
This app sucks. If I was you I would listen to Amazon music. The new update just makes you listen to music that isn't your taste. It also put you at random songs that you can't skip. Lastly the liked songs you like play differant music that isn't on your list. 1 star Spotify. Hopefully y'all can go back to normal but for right now you suck.,0
Constantly desyncing from Spotify on other devices. I mainly use this app to control Spotify on other devices and sometime last year they screwed up the cross-device functionality so it often won't function properly.,0
"I love this app, it gives the listener a high quality of sound and it has great catalogue of music which caters for everyone's tastes. The plus with Spotify Pro you get the added bonus of no ads and get to download whatever song or album you like. Spotify also grows with you, it keeps track of all your music likes and Spotify gives you a more tailor-made experience. 10/10 ' love it.'",1
Good music for everyone and tastes,1
"Its really bad now, every time try to pay it always reconet over and over. Enough with spotify.",0
Interupts my playlists with other music I have not requested. Really annoying!,0
I cant add songs to playlists all the time and can never click on a new album to see what the songs or add them. Been this way for like a year.,0
"Lately, when I shuffle play my playlist, it only plays one song and then just stops. I got back to the app, and do reshuffle my playlist and it still does the same thing. I'm literally about to uninstall this and get another app.",0
Does the job minus the ads but it's bearable,1
"Came here after 3 frustrating weeks of increasing bugs to see I'm not alone. I already had the latest update, and it still didnt work. So uninstalled the app and reinstalled yesterday.. works perfectly now. Might have been helpful if Spotify could have suggested this ðŸ˜",0
"I really do enjoy using this app but recently there has been an issue that has been bugging me. Anytime I try to play music offline, some songs in the playlist do not play (I use premium). I would have to go online in order for them to play. I haven't had this problem before so I presume it's an issue from the app, it's quite annoying and I'd like if it's fixed",0
Technical issues with the app 30% of the time,0
Very good application for listening music free ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
"the controls keep disappearing and i can't pause music, view albums or view artists. neither can i like a song or have the permission to add it to my playlist. but apart from that, it's way better than any other music platform!",1
I recommend using this app I thought they charge but surprisingly they don't but the only thing I don't like is they I get to many emails but I still like this app to listen to musicâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸,1
I love this app to listen songs,1
It is a good music app you can have however many Playlist you want that is what I need so I give it a 5 star,1
"Spotify keeps freezing and crashing, I have done absolutely everything I can do get it to work properly but it still will not work. Fix your app please, I would really like to listen to music.",0
"To many ads are there, after two song their will a ad . Since i am using this app from last 7 moths, in starting their are less ads but now it is irritating.",0
A lot of ads are poping while i listen songs. The time of poping ads is 30 minutes but now a days ads are poping every 10 minutes,0
Not using very often now so i plan to cancel my duo plan around 2 weeks ago but still have been charge. Not the service i want.,0
Only six skips per hour but I do like that you can leave the app and when I search up a song and try to listen to it that will play a different song and have to skip a couple times for it to play the song that I searched up,0
Nice ,1
Excellent options and good music ðŸŽ¶,1
I love Spotify. Keeps me up to date with new releases,1
"""play YOUR favorite music"" well guess what Spotify. Now I can't!!! Switching to a streaming service that will let me play Neil Young and Joni Mitchell and I suggest everyone does the same if they want to listen to their favorite artists before they lose them :(",0
"It was really great at first,but after the free trial ended you only get 6 skips and you can only listen to playlists on shuffleplay. And now I was trying to listen to my favourited songs it just started playing random songs,which I have never listened to. Please fix this.",0
I gave this a four the update HORRID HENRY WHAT THE FU PLS FIX THIS i want to listen to my fav song but it is just a preview! fix this now!,0
OP,1
Great mixes less adds highly recommended,0
Best app for songs,1
Constant glitches lately. Plays for a second then pauses on Bluetooth speakers. Yet I can't pause it when playing on my phone speaker - the controls completely disappear. Stay away on Android :( app is getting unusable on pixel 6,0
I'm joining Neil Young and others in the great Spotify Exodus and will uninstall the app shortly.,0
joyfully music and experience,1
there awesome but the only thing that is not good is that you have to have data or internet so if your traveling and don't have data you can't play music.,0
"Music play keeps skipping, only since the most recent update",0
Spotify just randomly logged me out and won't let me log back in anymore,0
No sound! Please fix. As a subscription payer this should be fixed ASAP.,0
Very good and easy to use app.All songs are available here.,1
Thank you Spotify for helping me always find the music I need!,1
This is the best platform for listening to music and have a reasonable fees for those who dont contain high money value,1
"Great app except for 1 crucial missing feature - Bring back the dislike/hide button feature. If I don't want to listen to something, I should have the option to hard block/hide it",1
Use full app Superb performance,1
Been having alot of problems since the newest update. Have to restart the app several times to have the song and its bar show. Music stops. Now I have to log in again for no reason.,0
Music is awesome. Have yet not to find something.,1
Found the app easy to use and your options are limitless,0
"Many Genres, greet selections!",1
I love Spotify it's a good app any kind of music that you're looking for is there.,1
BEST,1
Sometimes it's laggy for me. Crashes often too...(ã€€ï¼›âˆ€ï¼›)...,0
Very very nice music application. I like so much to hear songs by this app,1
"I love this app, the sound is clear and there is good use of song settings including lyrics that dosent need spotify premiem, althogh most things need premiem and there is a TON OF ADS. I reccomend using this app for for clear audio and sound. This app does need wifi. I personlly dont think anythings wrong with the app. But it could be better.",1
Great experience - thank you spotify. I'm having great time listening to wonderful music.,1
It will shuffle even tho the shuffle ain't on and I can't even control the music sometimes. Like it doesn't know it's playing. Pretty annoying.,0
this is veri nice,1
Recommended for all because all the songs are available in this app,1
Love the different station and ease of use to find the artists and songs I like ðŸ‘,1
"U can download this app if u want to listen ads. S lot of ads. Per 1 song that too 3-4 mins 3-4 that too the ads time is 1 min. , ( 1 ad time is 1 mins ) ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡",0
"Upon receiving various updates, the app has many glitches. Doesn't show the song playing. Can't control the songs. Can't turn off unless I force stop app or restart phone. I use to love spotify now it's on the verge of trash.",0
Cool beans people! Excellent listening. Not many commercials at all.,1
"Was great until recently, can no longer sort songs in playlists by recently added and the media control bar is half broken. I love listening to music and it's a shame that the app is being screwed over.",0
I feel awesome with Sportify always in happy mood as well as in groom mood.,1
Easy to use with music suggestions that are relevant to my tastes. Easy to add songs to play lists,1
Why is it so hard to rearrange tracks in a playlist??? I have a specific order I want my songs in and I can't even do that. Nothing I've googled has helped. I'm staying with YouTube music where I can find more tracks and view music videos.,0
Stop asking for Bluetooth permission. Never. Stop showing me podcasts. I have a dedicated podcast app for that.,0
"Ads on premium. Endless podcast spam. Rate 1 star, still get front page ads for a podcast i tried once, over 6 months ago.",0
"Abysmal, Length of individual songs is now MISSING! Playlist view is ridiculous and the song you are playing goes off to the left whole side with ZERO information about the length of the song. How can you make playlists for a 45 minute SPIN class??? Chat support is worthless.",0
"I updated my review to 4 stars from 2 stars because we can see the efforts made by spotify in order to remove bugs and glitches. Still, there are some glitches left which i think will be corrected if so,then i m gonna rate them 5 stars",0
"Too costly. Too hierarchical and privilege - based. Not easy to navigate new worlds, get stuck in a rut. Keeps changing the goal-posts. You can't even get dinner delivered or watch a film, so what is the point?",0
Nice song and sure app,1
Really good app with alot of podcast and endless music for all tastes and you really enjoy the offline listening and the quaility of the recomendatijs that it gives you,1
"This app is very beautiful, it contains Hindi Punjabi Urdu Chhattisgarhi who will search for songs That song comes I liked this app very much that's why I am giving this app five stars",1
Wow,1
Best streaming service,1
This app is trash. You need to pay in order to enjoy this app. Broke people like me wont ne enjoying this because you cannot skip song and random songs will pop out even it's not part of your playlist. You need premium to skip those random songs thats keep popping up.,1
Best music app around,1
Lots of bugs that need to be fixed. First it was the inability to get back to editing the queue to now unable to see the notification list of new podcasts.,0
This is the best music player app but please remove the adds,1
It's a really good music app u til your free trial is over and nothing works until you buy something,1
"My album artwork keeps disappearing. I clear the cache, uninstall and reinstall the app, and it works for a few days. After that, the artwork stops loading again.",0
It's a great app to stream music the premium plan has many great benefits,1
Good music selection...,1
I like it but it's so glitchy I try to play my favorite song it plays a different songs don't recommend!,0
"I've started getting ads come up 3 seperate times within the past 30 minutes, each having 3-4 ads at a time... This is the free version and Its expected to have ads every now and then but this is excessive.",0
Great app for finding your favorite music,1
"I hate the new update, I can't pause the song or see the lyrics, I wish it didn't update",0
Everything was great and easy to use until the update came. I cant even repeat the song unless i go to the playlist and click the song again and theres no shuffle anymore which makes a playlist not repetitive anymore,0
Podcast are great and as far as music there's a multitude of genre to choose from,1
The only drawback is about the ads which inturrupt the flow of music rather than that i think it's simply awesome ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘,1
Like that is has Everything I like to listen to. And with no commercial even better. Even the more like this are songs I've been wanting and not knowing the name brought some out! Thanks Spotify!,1
"Hi Spotify. After many years with you, I am switching over to SoundCloud. Your system is junk, in my opinion. I have heard that very little of my payments actually goes to the Artists who did all the work.Also, your random SUCKS!! I plays the same 20 songs from the same 3 artists over and over. Not matter what I delete, download or skip It goes back to the same songs over and over. Usually it's the ""intro"" or ""little ditty"" or the least desirable song on the album. Yet million to choose from BYE",0
Some difficulties. But good.,1
A very awesome app and the ads given are ok after one add we get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening,1
Disappointed!!!!I thought Spotify is where I can choose my own music from my favorite artist and vibe. Well is not like that anymore. Yu choose your artist they pick songs for you and you dont skip if you don't like the one they chose for you. All this just to get us into the premium. We get the ads but how bout choosing my own music like how a Streaming app should be like. Spotify your letting YouTube get ahead with millions of subscribers. And yu just lost this customer. -$30,0
"Good mixed of music and artists , well done, i enjoy it every time.",1
When I started using this app for about 1 to 2 weeks it was great cuz I can listen to the song i want with lyrics but now I can't cuz I can't listen to the full song that i want unless I listen to my playlist by shuffle and I have to wait for the song to play and that's not that bad but whats worse is you can only have a limit of skipping songs this is just what exactly happened to me last time on my other phone and THIS IS THE WORSE APP EVER!!!!!!!! PLEASE FIX THIS UP!!!!!!!,0
After the update Spotify stops playing after 5 minutes and you can't even access the pause/skip buttons. Not worth paying premium for a product that doesn't work.,0
"Won't show music player on lock screen, and a lot of songs I want to listen to are ""not available in my region"". Would use YouTube premium if not for this being cheaper.",0
"The free version is horrible. You can only skip 6 songs until 1 hour. Really. It's so stupid. Like I just want to listen to music freely. I don't mind adds here and then but please make at least 10 song skips. 6 is to low. Way to low. Can you ple3eeeaaaassee add ""Her Last Words- by Courtney Parker"" pleeeeeeeeeeaaaÃ aaaaasssseeeeee",0
Android recently did an update which broke the alarm integration with Spotify. It now plays the Android alarm at the same time as the Spotify song. The Google maps integration has also been glitchy for ever. If we have a phone connected to bluetooth It starts playing music whenever it wants to during navigation. We pause it or even close the Spotify app and it still starts itself up again and plays music between giving directions. They need to get better at testing and bug fixing.,0
"Great app, amazing variety of songs and podcasts, only bad thing is a few to many adds even with premium",1
"The android version of the spotify app often encounters bugs that make it crash, and has trouble with the ""currently playing"" area sometimes being inaccessible. This is particularly annoying when you miss what someone said in a podcast, and have to close the app and restart it before you can adjust your place.",0
Amazing. I love creating personal playlists.,1
"While the recommendations work great, the app desparately needs the following features (basic stuff really) IMO 1. ArtistS, composers, albums and songs category/tabs in library 2. Option to select individual tracks to download instead of whole playlist/album.",0
You need to fix this I can't choose my own music and I have family premium... Fix this please,1
Still have adds on podcasts even tho I have premium,1
Very good complete song,1
Used for around 4 years now. This app is too good.,0
Lots of glitches lately like I can't scroll sideways on the ganra selector in my liked playlist,0
So disappointed why just why do we need a playlist to play music and y guess what the playlists is also needs me to create new playlists I made 25 playlists and the same thing popped up and we only have six skippes why not infinite.,0
Very user friendly and has all good collection of music.,1
"New update pauses music randomly and is very buggy, can't change song within the app without closing and reopening it. What a mess!!",0
"I love listening song,s on this app but one problem it have much adds but this is the best app and this is much better than gaana",1
Please find a way to improve collaboration playlist. There are tons of bots that add random music to my playlist and I can't exactly do anything until I notice the bot. Maybe make it so only people with the link can add or edit playlist.,0
this is the most worse app when i click play on the song i wanted it just plays another song you cant play your favourite song so i uninstalled the app the app is trash,0
It's to slow and don't and it won't let me picks song from my library or shuffle it.,0
Tati app ,1
I rate it a 5 because the quality is picturesque although you could do less ads but still overall it is a great app also when you try to play a song you have to listen to a lot of songs before just to listen to the song you wanted to listen to.,1
Nice app for listening sounds,1
"I updated the app and there is SO many ads, like 2-7 ads after every 1-3 songs, and the 30 minute free ads do NOT give a full 30 minutes, I've started to use YouTube because it surprisingly gives LESS ads then Spotify now?? I mean I can't use it in the background on my phone, but on my computer I can, so I use YouTube when I can. Also the feature where you can listen to samples of the songs when adding them to playlists is gone, WHY???",0
Spotify picks the music I love for me.,1
Spotify is easy to use,0
it is good but ad is coming,1
"Like this app, never had it crash and content is awesome",1
"Best music app I've ever had. So convenient, and it knows exactly what music am in the mood for.",1
"Even when I have bad connection, I can listen to my music normally",0
"It was working perfectly before I updated my phone to one UI 4.0, but now, every time that I restart it the app forgets that the music is saved at the SD card instead of the phone and so I have to uninstall its data from the SD before I can send the downloaded music back.",0
I like using Spotify but whyyyyy can I only skip 6 times there are song I don't want to listen you know and you can't skip the ads and I can't even play a song I actually want this app is so annoying to use it's not even good anymore,0
"I only have it so i can listen to songs they took off of youtube music, trash compared to youtube premium, rip off musicians and buy rights to songs so nobody can listen to them",0
"It's good as only songs, no useless chatting & self marketing of presenter or others.",1
"After uninstalled for months I am reinstalling this app . The previous reason for unistallation was , There were issues like we can't hear we want instead of it we have to went through playlists which we usually don't like and also '' THERE WAS NO FREEDOM OF HEARING "". Hopefully now there wouldn't be forceful policy to opt premium version.",0
Why don't u play tracks in order..I wanna mix I set it that way...I love Spotify and pay Â£10 per month 4 the privilege but I want my playlist 2 play in the order it on.. annoys having 2 queue when it's in order anyway. Please please fix,0
"Easy and nice, thanks.",1
There appears to be more and more bugs happening every day. It's a shame the overall rating doesn't fully capture the current experience using the mobile app. Every issue I'm experiencing I can find in other users ratings.,0
"Brand new s22 and this is unusable. The mini player keeps disappearing from the app and notification bar. It says there's no internet available when there is. If I'm using offline mode and try to play my downloaded songs, I'll keep tapping a song and nothing happens, nothing plays.",0
Keep crashing. I have a 256 gb Mico SD in my phone. The storage selection is on it. If you restart your phone it deletes all the downloads you have. The app will also just crash for no reason. Been going on for month now and I've been using Spotify for 4 years... fix the app please,0
Very disappointed I cannot download mp3 even with Premium... Shame,0
Well since I started using this app  finding music is such a breeze and a walk in the park  Even though I thought that I can download music in the app  I was still happy to find every kind of music I wanted ,1
Its so useful thank you Spotify ,1
"What I can't stand is spotify playing songs not in my playlist or liked songs and then when I go back to my playlist I get another string of ads when I just had a bunch of ads saying ""30 minutes of ad free music"" bs",0
This app contains no songs from à®‡à®£à¯ˆà®¨à¯à®¤ à®•à¯ˆà®•à®³à¯ movie in tamil movie and many other tamil movie song,0
"I'm having so many problems with the latest install, it doesn't show up on my display, the bar down the bottom to pause or change the song has disappeared, it's randomly glitching/stalling during podcasts... It's sooo frustrating!!",0
New update is the worst doesn't connect properly to a Bluetooth device and doesn't show the song info like before. I need to reset the app constantly to fix this problem.,0
Spotify was pretty great till the new update came. They added random songs in my playlist without reason and I can't choose the songs I want to play the old update was way much better,0
"Current nit pick is the push notification when you get to your car, no way to disable it. App still does poorly transitioning to data if wifi is poor, leading to app hangs.",0
IT is a great great great experience with Spotify and it can tell us story . I am impressed with spotify ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,1
"The app isn't bad, however there are several issues. Firstly, you can make a playlist of songs you want, however you can't choose which to listen to, but have to play shuffle, and even then you either play shuffle again or skip a song (6 skips every hour is ridiculously low amount) to get to what you want. After every song there are 3-4 ads. I understand it is a free service, but considering artist are barely even payed, this is ridiculous. Overall would just recommend downloading songs instead.",0
Just awesome and easy,1
I pay for Spotify not because I have to but because I choose to support a platform that provides a forum for free speech. Thank you Spotify for providing an excellent service.,1
The songs I like when I want to hear them!!!,1
I bought a Pioneer head unit with Spotify on them for both my cars. This was over Â£1000 and was working fine in both cars until a recent Spotify update decided that this feature (the main reason I bought them) was no longer going to be available. I tried installing a previous version of Spotify but Spotify has systematically been removing older APKs from places that allow you to download them so now I have Â£1000 worth of.....radio. Hurry up and fix this!!!,0
"It's buggy. App stops often, the player disappears. Have had to reinstall so many times now. Pretty disappointed this being one of the biggest apps in the world",0
"Useless spotify many adds, no download music category on your device and my mobile data is wasting. I Un installed this already.",0
Doesn't delete the search result quickly upon pressing X after the new update.,0
Clear sounds with lots of choices,1
"Awesome! Thanks, Spotify!!",1
I lovd listening to music constantly and spotify helps. Too many ads but if you listen to music as much as i do the ad free things pretty worth it.,1
"Usually great but recently the app has been bugging quite badly - I'll pause the music to do something outside of the app, and when I go back the control bar has vanished so I can't play, skip etc. Still have the bar in notifs but that stops syncing with what's playing so barely useful and even closing all, reopening the app & picking new song doesn't fix it, just now I don't even have notifs bar to control it. Really ruins the usability.",0
Its the best app for free music According to me its superb Music playing speed is Very fast,1
"pretty good, the adds are fine, but can get annoying at times. Great for listening to music obviously, spotify is amazing but thats just my opinion people may think other wise. If you are looking for peoples opinions on what they think of spotify, I would suggest looking at other peoples opinions.",1
It's not the best like even with the subscription when I go to my liked songs it only plays a portion of the song then stops and when I click on shuffle my liked songs it plays the most random song like what the hell.,0
"After new UI update, scroll bar won't work",0
To good to otragesce I LIKE IT I LIKE A LOT LIKE I LIKE A ROLLO AND I DON'T CHERE,1
"Ew, new update, very bad, pause/play on the side? Back and next right next to each other? totally throws off the dynamic, looks hella ugly.",0
Facing a glitch in the mobile app since yesterday. Its closing abruptly whenever I try to play any music. Kindly help me in resolving the issue.,0
They have a great selection of music.,1
"It's pretty good, but a bit buggy at times. Really annoying adverts (including for podcasts on premium plans which makes me wonder what I'm paying for but at least most can be skipped through in 15 second increments). I used to enjoy podcasts like the Wall Street Journal but listening to the same Go Daddy advert over and over again has sapped my interest.",0
This is the worst mobile music app ever,0
The amount of Ads after listening to 15 minutes of music is getting frustrating. I'm a free user but I feel like I'm bombarded with ads.,0
Music pauses twice during each song :(,0
"This is a really good app , this is the best app for must. It has all the song in the world. I wanted to give a suggestion to add rate and comment feature to it",1
This has to be the best app ever made because the sound quality and availability of songs on this app remains unmatchable,1
Really lovely music you can choose from any songs that you want,1
What happened to the shuffle? It only starts on the last song you listened to now? Not really shuffle isn't it?,0
Love the variety of different music available.,1
Great music app and even without premium it's great I love my daily playlists,1
Fine efficient and gets most of the music I like.,1
This app is nice ,1
Missing tons of big name artists and now Neil Young. Supports BLATENT misinformation. Cancelled and uninstalled,0
Great app but ruined by too many ads particularly if an ad for 30 mins is displayed...within 15 mins another ad is displayed...Ads are running for free service but try to understand that too much of anything is good for nothing... People listen to music in various mindset but continuous ads keep on disrupting the listener... I finally uninstalled this app.,0
Truly fantastic app. Essential for anyone who loves music. Ingenious features. life be dull without it!!! Premium is sensational too,1
Last release has so many bugs someone should be fired. UX/UI people should have never let this be released. Paying customers deserve better.,0
Great,1
Why is it playing different songs when I choose to play a song? I'm switching to apple music.,0
"Premium customer btw. Lately the app has been removing my music controls at the bottom, removing itself from notifications, so if my screen turns off it stops playing music, constantly skipping music (kind of repeating the same part of the song multiple times), and randomly just cutting out. This all happened as soon as the last update dropped",0
Love the variety of artists and personalized suggestions. My playlists keep me sane these days!,1
I have always been a music lover. This app satisfies every curiosity and desire for unlimited hours of fun. Music based nirvana.,1
"Really very good app, you will get all the new songs and good recommendation. But ads and regular update are disturbing.",0
I hate the new update I can never put on a sing that I like and spotify keeps on adding songs to my playlist that I dont like,0
"Excelent! I just don't understand that, even having the latest version (auto updatings) and using it for more than a year now, I can't see the lyrics while playing the songs... Someone help me!",0
Great music app works good for me.,1
"Average & Constantly Changing Their Layout Makes For A Terrible Experience, If They Would Only Bring All The Good Features Back & Make The Paid Experience Awesomely Whole, With All The Features In WiFi - Bluetooth & DATA sharing/casting and Full Screen Rotation, But Lacking That Experience Questions Weather To Pay For This Or Notâ€¼ï¸ We're not missing out on anything with premium Really, Free works Better I know I cancelled 2 years ago my 4 year's of Premium subscription",0
I like it a little more than I thought you might like it too...,1
"It's Spotify, you know what you're getting. Shout to Neil young for keeping it real. Pay the artists.",1
The app works just fine and am enjoying it and no unnecessary ads,1
I love this app before but one day I want to play music so I go here in Spotify but it was already updated and it was sooooooo terribleðŸ˜¡so plssss return the old Spotify,0
App stops working inexplicably. Music is a huge part of my life. If a music service is offered it needs to be available any time. I'd rather go to apple.,0
clear and crispy sounds of music....very nice to listen specially at bedtimes,1
I love how it's always there when I need it and love the whole range of music that is available,1
Premium version? Best thing you could use for music. Free version? Worst thing you could use for music. Not only is premium almost required unless you wanna listen to ads half the time but it costs way too much just for a few features to be enabled,0
It gets more glitches every day. Almost unusable at this point and I pay for premium.,0
Love it! No ads for me. Worth the money!,0
Music from Spotify is enjoyable .. I've never had even a single ad.. its the bestâ¤everee,1
Wide range of music of quality sound,1
Refused to protect people by removing dangerous content. Cancelled my subscription and deleted the app. The only thing I recommend is that you do the same.,0
"Spotify banners and widgets overheat battery. Still, Spotify is dream come true for me. Everything I need for my music. No drama. No load up times, massive selection I haven't been unable to find a track as yet and I listen to some crazy stuff. One thing tho I listen to metal, d and b a bit of hip hop blah blah on your latest suggestions for me you offered James Blunt...really Spotify. Lol. Get this app if you love music.",1
Great suggestions. Not that easy to navigate always. Ads not relevant...and that's ok.,1
Best music streaming app.,1
"For some reason I can't loop or replay songs, and it's really sad because it's why I used Spotify. I'm probably going back to Pandora.",0
Desktop app is great but the mobile app is so infuriating to navigate,0
Love the mass amount of content available. The $9.99 a month is well worth it. I use Spotify everyday since I work for myself and am on the road a lot. The Joe Rogan experience is on here also and it is the best podcast. Joe Rogan for president 2024!,1
Good music player,1
It is the best music app I like it,1
Love it All my music in one place,1
App is trash. Company business practices are trash. Good algorithm but that's not worth more than a star.,0
Awesome need to keep this up,1
Gurthan Singh,1
I'm using Spotify almost 2 / 3 years ... Nowadays you are putting so many ads it's irritating i 2 ads to listen one tamil songs stupid ... I'm going to un install worst experience ðŸ˜¡ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,0
it's better once u have premium but there's better apps that u can use instead of not having premium,0
Exceptionally super duper app! The best!!! Julio Blanco.,1
I love all their content good music all the time and it's for free and can't get any better than that.,0
I pay for premium and yet i still receive pop ups and voting polls. I may not have ad interpretations and I may be able to skip as many songs as I like but for Â£10 a month this is unacceptable,0
Good,1
I love this app. The only problem is there no way to download songs. The whole reason I wanted a music is to listen on the road if going on long trip. But i cant listen offline. And i am not going $120 a year to listen offline! Plz fix this. This app is my favorite to navigate. Plz read this.,1
"I love it but I wish they would stop recommending songs when I'm listening to my liked Playlist, and the recommendations aren't even related to what i like to listen to. The ads I watch that give you a ""half hour of uninterrupted listening"" only give me 2 songs worth.",0
I love this app but recently i got logged out by mistake and it's not logging me in again i even tried reinstalling and all stuff but nothing worked.,0
Auto plays when connected to android auto. Cannot disable.,0
I wish multiple users within a household could listen at a time ðŸ˜‚ nothing is worse than driving and dancing out then my music getting stolen by my child at home. I love everything else â¤ï¸,0
I love it :) my husband and I we use it everyday ðŸ’Ÿ,1
So far the free version is very cool. I expect the premium version to be exceptional when I pay for it... It very well may be everything YouTube music wants to be.,1
I honestly love this app it's amazing I love it and nothing is wrong with it it's the perfect app for listening to music so If u want to listen to music get this app!â¤ï¸,1
Love app but hate lossing all my songs when i cant aford premium should just lock em or not let u get more not make u start over had 3000+ songs in library an alot of it was new people names idk so cant find alot. So pay or kinda sucks an make youtube easyer its free to have a library an never erased or this would be 5* app,0
I gave it 5 star before but after a while I found out I was completely wrong. It gives out updates every week but there is nothing changed still got the old bugs and it's annoying sometimes. Also as someone who is paying for listening to a whole world of music I rather enjoy the musics that I like and can access to them and unfortunately this app takes money from you to not to listen to some musics and that is a disaster in my opinion plus because that I want to change the application,0
"What a great Valentines gift....2 months of premium play at no cost. THATS RIGHT, FREE!! LOVE the range of classic rock that I can choose from. Country too! My hats off to you.",1
"Good source of music, but it would be nice to be able to add an rss feed for podcasts not already in their library. Also, add a setting so I can make it not automatically play my last song when I open the app. I understand some people want that, but I don't. Just give me an option.",0
Very good app now I can listen to my favourite music without searching on YouTube for songs,1
App working perfectly fine when it's on mobile data .. prblm come when it's connected to wifi... It's showing no network connection and search Is working.. tried with different wifis and different routers ... Working fine with mobile data... Please look into this issue ... Have seen lots are having the same issue in the Spotify community,0
I would give it a 5 star but there is too much adds and it keeps on saying use premium,0
I like this because all of my music lover friends downloaded this appsðŸ˜,1
Simple & easy to use app. Easy to navigate and all songs available,1
You know why,1
It's nice to keep bhajans and audio podcasts for free in the morning ðŸŒ„ when I did the darshan. Thank you Spotify. Great people.,1
"Lyrics are not visible in my Spotify, even though the version is up-to-date!",0
Sometimes when I play music the now playing screen/toolbar is missing completely at the bottom so I have to restart the app.,0
"Love everything, so easy to navigate and I always find my favorite songs ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¿",1
"Hi, can you fix it when i play my favorite song it always short song",0
This app is very nice. I like this app.This app has very nice song and gojol.I suggest you all install and try this app.,1
"Nothing I couldn't find on the platform, and works well even in low reception areas",1
You can listen to lots of music the only thing you have to worry about is lots of ads and you have a limit of skipping,0
I love Spotify and I couldn't live without it but pleaseeeee add swipe to que!!! It's such a shame android user can't use this. Just this feature alone would make everyone's experience 1000% easier!,0
"The app was good so far. But suddenly after the last update, the app keeps crashing whenever I'm trying to play anything making both the app and my subscription useless.",0
Great App. New to me and I find it easy to get songs,1
"I can't afford premium, so i expect there to be ads. But 10 in a row during a mental breakdown when i need comfort music is infuriating. And there used to be a thing with ""watch this ad and there will be 30 mins of uninterrupted listening"" which used to pop up at least once a day. I haven't gotten one of those in months. It feels like I'm listening to more ads than music, which is not what I want from a music app.",0
Good app,1
"The song that you, the musician that you want all in one place!",1
I've changed my review because Spotify used to be a great app for me but now it's turned out to be not that great. So I go into my favorites y'know and I press shuffle play but then it just keeps on playing the song I listened to last time. When I try to play my actual songs it just plays a little bit of it and then it stops and I have to go to the actual album to play it. Now when I first got the app there was no adds and I didn't have premium and now there is? Spotify please fix this!,0
I sincerely don't have any thing bad to say about this app and I love this way they arrange their play list,1
"I face issue This time won't be able to play any song, when I try to play a song it gets minimised, resolve this issue I am using premium account.",0
"Love this app, I only use this for my music streaming. I pay for premium for my family and both my mom and I have been experiencing weird pauses and skips. For example, sometimes when I let my phone screen time out while playing music and it goes dark it pauses, sometimes it will come back on its own and other times I have to restart the app. It pauses other times too. It's a minor inconvenience but very annoying.",0
"Living remotely, Spotify is the only way to go. Love it.!!!",0
"It sucks doesn't show lyrics for any song, and the new set of ads is straight up irritating, it's messed up now",0
"The number of adds they are adding is insane , I got 7 adds continuously",0
There are no adds at all great songs you can look up any songs its all free you can make a playlist you just a email 5 stars,0
Excellent,1
"NicestðŸ™‚ app I've ever used , u can edit your playlist to hear the songs you would like to listen to, but the fact that you can't skip songs more than 6 times is bad ðŸ˜ž appart from that the app is super, I hope you will update the skipping (play next) and also update the back skipping (play back) thanks",0
It was great but as of recently I turn on the app and all there it shows is a black screen with the bell and setting icons that don't work and then it says that it's not responding.,0
i have a recommendation let us change the photo of the liked songs playlist and new themes for the app also thanks for the experience by the way the app is clean,1
"simple, easy and fun",1
"At first! It was really good. But suddenly Idk what happened, I can't skip any song, I can't play any song. And they just sayed me ""Slow down! You get 6 skips per hour"". It totally disgusted me. ðŸ˜ ",0
I found all my related songs at one place. Recommended.,1
"In love with the app. I listen to my playlist on it for 7+ hours a day ðŸ˜ Best of all, it's 100% free!!",0
"Its a music player, multibillion dollar company Spotify, fix it",0
"The podcast feature is not great: it can't find some podcasts which are available on the service when i search, and it says'Sometning went wrong' when I try to add them with the Spottify link. It also shows EVERY different show from some multi-show creators when you search for one show by name but it won't let you subscribe to only one of them!",0
LIKEE,1
"Recently transitioned from Apple to Samsung (IOS to Android). While the UI is the same, the back end is a different story. The IOS version of this app is far better and more responsive. On this device (S22 Ultra), I cannot scrub through songs via Bluetooth on Ford Sync, the function does not work. When I scrub through songs manually through the app the bar moves but the song remains at the same spot. When I pause the song the bar goes back to the original position. This need to be fixed.",0
Already had some problems but the Joe Rogan thing made me decide to cancel my premium subscription. There are plenty of other streaming services now. It Stutters a lot when im listening to it now even though the songs are downloaded to phone.,0
I experience a good day during that I listening my favorite songs of my favorite singerðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—,1
Was a great app. Now it's broken. You can't see play or pause buttons anymore... Which is kinda crazy for a music playing app. I will cancel if this isn't sorted asap.,0
"It's very frustrating, keeps crashing, stops and starts randomly.",0
Great music app. I used it to host my party and It was great.,1
I just like Spotify and the selection they have.,1
I loved it but now idk how to play a full song like the new update you can listen to bit of it to see what it is but idk how to play all of it :/ and i can't play a playlist it will play a random song that i don't even know :|,0
Disappointed the fact i have to keep downloading my music. This kills my monthly data usage,0
The music I've liked over my lifetime all in one place! Great App!!!,1
I have to complaint about horror audio . Please stop horrifying us . Please stop that kind of shows . It was disgusting .,0
Just love it easy to use . Lots of great features and options!,1
"I dealt with issues for over 6 months, contacted support numerous times. I had the app limited to only 5 songs at a time, when that got fixed after several months the app proceeded to crash and randomly stop playing, then it would just randomly play in my pocket with the app in the background. Asked for some money back for all the time I couldn't use the app and they offered to refund one month and put me on a free account. 6 months of bs? Have $10 and ads. YouTube Red just got another user",0
Just installed the update that fixed the android auto but the player controls keep disappearing and have to restart the app this was happening before the update,0
Spotify is all and more than I could want for my musical exploration and enjoyment.,1
Tons of content that I love. Cool interface .,1
Really enjoying this app. Easy to use and never let's me down. Well worth it ðŸ˜Š,1
Very bad it is not working when I m playing the song it is closing by itself,0
Very nice ,1
"Garbage coding. Play bar doesn't open so I have no control over music, constantly pauses for no reason, when I disconnect from Bluetooth (car) it immediately starts playing out phone speakers, crashes constantly and several more. S21+ So not spec issue, and only happens with Spotify. Whoever made this needs firing ASAP. Fix immediately.",0
Luv listening to music. Spotify is the best,1
"This app keeps getting worse after I seriously tried to give a chance. The app doesn't work right in the car, it plays an entirely different song I selected and picks the worst music that I don't listen to and now I found out there is a song skip minimum which I did in about 2 minutes. Are you freaking kidding me and every email they send is in a language I can't understand when I open it. Spotify has to be punking me because this is beyond ridiculous. I wouldn't spend 1 penny on this app.",0
I love this app so much because it has all of my favorite songs and the lyrics are the best! Even if you arent using the lyrics the lyrics goes with the song!,1
"Spotify Premium user for several years now, app quality seems to consistently get worse over time. Queued songs duplicating, said duplicates deleting queued songs, random songs being added to the queue, shuffle isn't great, etc.",0
Too many adds. Constant issues with skipping to next song. Practically useless.,0
It has been super buggy and crashes constantly,0
It's better than the other available music apps and I like some of the features and suggestions but it isn't Google Play Music and I miss it,0
"I would have rated this as -â˜† if that's be possible, Spotify have become the most annoying app just because of the ads, I understand that you can't provide music for free everytime and want us to purchase your premium but dude, this much ads for the free people? Really? Ads are continuously coming back to back, like after every 2-3 songs the ads appear. Fix it dude, stop showing these much advertisements, its just ruin the music experience of people who loves to listen.",0
Absolutely broken. Now playing songs don't show up in the app but the music plays anyway. Skip controls via sync do not work. Switching from music to video with audio doesn't stop the track. Garmin controls broken. Can't take calls via Bluetooth as the music won't stop. Fix I cancel my subscription. Oh its also obvious Spotify are paying for favorable reviews due to the influx of real negative ones. Just look at the surge in Indian 5* reviews in the last days.,0
Best app for listening music ...,1
"Whenever I head to my liked songs and play a specifc one, it'll only play for a few seconds.",0
"Unlimited Curated Playlist ability, artist information and fun to have similar artist recommendations made from my taste in music. I learn about new music from Spotify.",1
This streaming service is very laggy and it's so hard to listen to even a single 3 minute song without it taking 18 minutes to play til the end. I was so unhappy with it I decided to use it as toilet paper and now I need a new phone,0
"100% Great app, I have listened to a bunch of Roagan pod casts and music. Now dont get me wrong it has a little glitches and all but it is overall a great app.",1
"I used to love using this app, but now you have to pay inorder to listen to your own music. The mechanic is overall really stupid and annoying",0
I love the ðŸŽµ! The only thing I don't like is that local files cannot be made public as actual songs.,0
"So far, in 30 minutes, I have not heard a single song from MY 20 song playlist. It's all the stupid suggested songs. DO NOT GET THIS, PANDORA IS WAY BETTER",0
used to be a carefree experience with premium on my pocophone f1. but now the tab that shows playing music and lets me control what im listening to (next last loop etc) dissapears after leaving app or generally like every 15 minutes atleast so that i have to restart the app everytime to get it back. not acceptable for a premium service. and my phone is not old so i dont see why they update bugs into the app. shouldve turned auto updates off to not give them a chance to screw it up.,0
one song one ad of 30 second.... really very dissapointed with spotify... rudiculous way to beg for the money...,0
Amazing app. Useful for all music needs.,1
My Playlist are gone. I click on one song and another one plays,0
I've had this app for years and it works great on both iPhone and Android. It's super easy to use and organize. I pay monthly to avoid commercials because it's definitely worth it. There's just no better way to put it. ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¼,1
I prefer this app to others. I like to collaborate with friends but I think I most enjoy the recommendations that come from the playlists that are set up by spotify. I have found a ton of new music since switching over.,1
First of all i installed the app and then I can't open it it get stuck on the spotify logo nothing happens,0
This is a great music ðŸŽ¶ app,1
I have been using paid version of spotify for quite a few years now and still love it!,1
it's horrible every song is tied to a shuffle and when you make a playlist spotify adds song you didn't ask for. Just use the ps4 version it's way better.,0
It makes me feel happy ðŸ˜Š It can make perfect Playlist for me.But there are adds after every 2 songs.,1
"It's really good, I really liked the music. However, you need a pretty good connection for it to work, and my house was not good enough, so I ended up having to use my personal data. But it didn't use a lot of data, and I was on it for hours at a time.",0
Good app but still some songs should be there I like BTS still with you song and many more English and Hindi so ðŸ˜¶,1
Dogshit 6 hours wait so I have to skip a song adds shoved down your throat constantly unable to listen to certain songs cause of the dumb auto shuffle play. Horrible experience,0
I hate the new update. I can't pause a song. I have to turn my phone completely off in order to turn the song off. The song isn't highlighted. It doesn't show up on the bottom of the screen. I pay for premium. I'm ready to cancel. If there is a way to do it I'd like to know. I've had this app along with my husband for years. Go back to the way it was. We had no problems. If the problem isn't solved I will be canceling.,0
Like being able to create my own playlists,1
Since I have decided to get Spotify I can listen to all my favorite podcasts and a few books as well I have had a wonderful experience so far and would recommend this app. Great music some that I could not find anywhere.,1
This is a good app for music but from last few days I had facing a issue that this application is auto closed when I paly the music...which irritates me.I reinstall this app still it through same error... what's going on with this app ....????ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜‘,0
Its a great music app but they need to stop pushing premium. If they didn't do that it would be an easy 5 stars.,0
The quality is top notch and is reliable.,1
It's more honestly to tell the user please purchase this apps at the beginning. Both side happy,1
"Is there a way to go back to the old version of Spotify? This new one isn't as easy to navigate. Also, pay your artists better.",0
"Never fails me, especially when I need the right song at the right time",1
I love this app but I get the same adverts everyday,0
I have just subscribed to one month premium. The app is excellent however the control bar always disappeared and I had to restart my phone every time it happened. Please fix this.,0
Best music /podcasts app ever I use it every night to fall asleep to my favorite songs<3,1
the app is easy to use.,1
The ads come too frequently and very repetitive. The ads keep interrupting like after every song there will be an ad longer than a song. Other than this it's a nice app.,0
"I was enjoying, but lately songs that's not on my list, not in my library, and music I don't even listen too keeps popping up. When I shut it off it pops back on again. I select a song only plays 2 seconds of the song and goes back to the song or artist I don't listen too and never heard of. I'm being nice by giving this app a 3 when it should be only 1 star.",0
Premium user. Used to work great now app doesn't display player so cannot skip/pause etc..,1
"Love the app. Just wish there was a way on there to adjust the sound quality, or give me bass I should say, for certain songs.",0
"Works great! The only thing I wish we had, was a better way to add songs to playlists. Being able to select multiple songs at a time and then add them all to whatever playlist, would be a lot faster and less frustrating than having to add each song individually. Hoping this feedback becomes reality!!",1
Quality is low on your platform as compared to others like Jio Saavn and Amazon music. Songs sounds like someone as choked the output.,0
"The apps free and has good music. Im new to this app and I like mucis but this one... hits different. When I play The music I want to listen for example: We dont talk any more. Instead of playing it, it plays the national anthem of russiaðŸ™„ðŸ˜« It happens to many songs too that when i play it it plays a completely different song that I dont likeðŸ˜¡ But this apps free so fix it... Please? Spotify is so greedy nowðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡",0
"The app is old garbage. Offline mode deletes daily playlist, daily freezes, you can't share a song without the app breaking once. It's just bad. Spotify is outdated as an app an same goes for the desktop application. Edit: I got my like playlist with 1500 songs. Spotify plays 20 of these if I press random. Still broken.",0
"Top notch app, podcast won't play. Have to reset my phone to be able to hear them",1
"My podcasts are stopping alot on me, and I update the app frequently. Could use some tweaking",0
"Hi Spotify devs, I like using Spotify but as of late the app has been unresponsive. I logged out of my Spotify account and since then the app would open but I wouldn't be able to login or access the homepage or anything. The app stays stuck on a screen just showing the Spotify logo. Can someone help me fix this please",0
Can please make your advertising so good because no one wants to just spent premium for it like i just want to listen songs freely but now i cant now I cant play any song what i want I cant timestamp I need to shuffle play even though its bad I wish you can just do this pls cuz we dont want to spend premium to have these features,0
I hate putting such a negative review on the app because I truly do enjoy it though recently since I've gotten a new phone I've been having some issues with the music sporadically stopping and when I'm not using any Bluetooth it just stops playing altogether unless I have phone on and on the app please fix these issues,0
Very nice experience ,1
Spotify started off great but...days later came out bad it won't let me listen to my favorite song on favorites list.and it only makes me shuffle :(,0
I love listening to adds this app is perfect for listening adds they play few songs among 10 to 15 adds which is the most irrating part,1
I'm getting fed up with Spotify. Even though I have almost 2000 liked songs it plays the same hundred or so when on shuffle. To the point where I end up unliking some of my favorite songs so they don't get over played. I want a shuffle option where songs are not repeated until all songs have been played. And it should be able to keep track of what's been played over multiple days. Also wish the algorithm could recognize a genre I play infrequently and not change my recommendations.,0
In free version there are too many ads but after upgrading it to premium it's just amazing,1
"App stuck on loading black screen with Spotify logo, restarted, reinstalled, no luck! Using Note 20 ultra",0
Very Very best,1
Love Spotify it's the best,1
"As of today (19/2/22), shuffle keeps turning itself on. Until today, I didn't mind all the usual pointless visual / layout changes and that kind of stuff, but you should at least stop things happening like shuffle turning itself on!",0
"What have you done Spotify? It's a great app but the most recent update was terrible. Since then my app keeps crashing in the middle of the song and the toolbar at the bottom is often gone, too. These are the basics, please fix this! :/",0
"Usally I would give this app an all around 5 stars, However for some reason it has been so buggy lately in so many ways it seems that it is too ridicolus for me to give a full 5 starts. Honestly it's frustrating when I've had to uninstall and reinstall at least 4 times already just to get it to work good for even a few more days.",0
The music quality is amazing! Music is my stress relief and Spotify makes it an easy way to feel better. I love creating new playlists (I have like wayyyyy to many lmao.) Spotify premium with no adds is also definitely worth the money! I remember when I used to have to listen to adds and it really killed the vibe. 11/10 would recommend !!!!,1
"I love the app. The only reason it is not 5 stars is when I start a group session not one phone plays at the same time. They are all off by a second. Not cool at all Spotify, not cool. Lol still an awesome app!!!",0
"I really enjoy spotify premium and have so for the last few years as a subscriber. After recently updating my phone, my spotify no longer plays anything. All my saved data is gone. The titles and playlists are there but nothing plays. It keeps saying no internet connection try again. I have followed all the troubleshooting options as well. I only just resubscribed 3 weeks ago ðŸ˜ž",0
Super buggy these days,0
I know the designs are beautiful but when I play a song another song plays I get annoyed because I can't even listen to the song I want. I'll just delete it instead of getting stuck and then update then it doesn't even work properly.,0
"Best music app for me. I use spotify when I want to curate what I listen to AND discover new music, but pandora to only discover new music. Where this benefits is that I can save songs and pick when to listen to them. Can't do that with pandora.",1
It's a app for listening to music. It gives you custom playlists and notifies you of new songs from your favorite artist. I like it,1
Second update - this app gets NO better. Still super buggy. The worst app I've ever dealt with. Have to re-install almost every month to make it work. Using s22 ultra. UPDATE - This app only gets worse. Now on a premium subscription I'm getting ads on Joe Rogan. Such a poor move. I'm so annoyed that rogan moved to this app. It's so buggy freezes. Stops playing randomly. Continues playing on the speaker when disconnected from bluetooth. Used to paused all the time. How is this app so popular,0
"Until recently Spotify was my favorite application, but for 2 months now, I have a problem that is when I open the app it takes too long and then it comes out that it does not respond, I have to exit and then re-enter, and sometimes I It takes so long that I prefer to use another music app or listen to my songs already downloaded. It is a problem that overwhelms me a lot because I love to use my playlists in this app.",0
Downloaded podcasts don't play all the way through without internet. It completely defeats the point of downloading...,0
"What happen, Spotify?? Its really good before but now dhhdhdhdhssh.......first i unfollow some artist/s then the number of my following doesn't change at all.....Second I create a playlist but the song I didn't put to it actually play please fix it, thank you!!",0
Perfect for anytime listening So many categories for songs and too many songs for any mood and UI is also clean and simple,1
Spotify kinda sucks without premium but with premium it easily the best music app.,1
"Best music app! Love the podcasts as well. Best wishes, Lesco Brandon",1
The best music app that I have found. All the songs I've ever listened to plus !!!! The stars don't go high enough I would rate this app a 10++,1
"I have been pleased with Spotify, the variety of music and podcasts.",1
"Fantastic when it works. I wish there was an easier way on Android to start a ""Private Session"".",1
Everything is great But ads are very irritating I know if iam not premium then ads will be there but insted of products and all you choose to ruin the moment which is not good It's kinda blackmail,0
Doesn't work well and they just canceled some videos. I believe in free speech. I am Uninstalling.,0
Nice Music app op !ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ,1
The best music app that I have used so far,1
Syncs well with Shazam!,1
"Great app, but a little bit expensive for collage students, well, it's my opinion",1
I really really like this app thoðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜‰no matter how old the music is you will n always find it on SPOTIFYYYYðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜âœŒðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬,0
"This was good appðŸ˜ƒ ..but too much ads will come in this app ðŸ˜µðŸ˜•.. do something for too much ads ðŸ§ðŸ§...song are very good in this app ðŸ‘Œ... all kinds of song .. romanticðŸ˜ðŸ˜, bhaktiðŸ§šâ€â™‚ï¸ðŸ§šâ€â™€ï¸ , party ðŸ¥³ e.t.c... and we listen any singer song like Darshan raval, Neha , kaka, Dhavni Bhanushal, ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ¤.. even are favorites singer song and also lyricðŸ¤—.I am very happy to seen this app is very popular nowadays ðŸ˜‡.... Good job ðŸ‘... Thanks for you will give me a this chance for rating Spotifyâ˜ºâ˜ºâ˜º....",1
Why can't I access my different categories under my liked songs anymore!? This was the best part about liking songs. Super annoyed.,0
"Make sure you buy the plan when you wanna start the billing date otherwise they won't care they'll take your money like they did me and let you starve there is no form of changing billing or getting a refund they just take your money and run, pretty selfish if ya ask me. Other than that you can't turn off auto pay and Bluetooth connections are trash I'm very upset with this company and I've been using them since I was 15 years old. Never again!!",0
"Very easy, great song selection.",1
"Iam suprimen to all the songs of my favorito artists on this app, I apreciate the wonderful work of the producer very satisfizo and fulfiling you deserve more bravo!!!!",1
"I've had premium since 2012, and it only keep gets better.",0
It added random stuff to my playlist that I didn't want but its good apart from that,1
Music comes clear and great sound. If yours sounds tinny it would be because of the media you are using. I use a U2 boom box and the clarity and volume is great. The ads are pretty short and no way near what you get on a radio station plus you only listen to your favourites.,1
So tell me exactly why I have to listen on shuffle for my own Playlist and nobody elses...IF IM ON MY OWN PLAYLIST WHY DO I NEED A PREVIEW OF THE SONGS!,0
Pretty good selection of different types of music,1
Why does this App play random songs when all I want is my liked songs? The arrogance is staggering. Terrible user interface. Three button taps just to repeat the current song?,0
"I'm a non premium user and the ads are getting so annoying and also there's a problem with this app even tho I have high speed internet connection it shows ""no internet connection"" and the app stops playing songs mid way and I had to reopen the app and play the song again.. please fix the problem and make it little bit easier for non premium users",0
"This app does 1 thing that no other app does. I can pause Spotify and not play anything for 3 hours, then when I disconnect my wireless buds it starts playing the previously paused music through my phone's speaker! FFS, just stay paused. Poor app, dodgy company, don't recommend anyone to pay for Spotify, it's a joke",0
This app is not working properly,0
Sad that Spotify values money over morals - allowing someone like Joe Rogen to spread false info on a serious subject like a pandemic or vaccine is disgusting. Great music selection but mobile app should allow more member customization of the Home screen based on personal interests and music tastes. I truly hate all the podcast noise that exists on the upper part of screen. Please let users arrange their Spotify desktop or remove things they have no interest in.,0
This is a really good I just love it but I only have 4 stars because of lagging problems sometimes when I click one song it automatically change into any other songs that I don't want to other wise it's a really good app,1
I really like this app compared to all other music streaming apps I gave 4 stars....if there was a way to earn replays I would give 5 stars. thanks for the music ðŸŽ¶,1
Great except when the ads interrupt the music your listening to.,0
"Spotify used to be great, but they have more than doubled the amount of adds that play. Unless you are a premium subscriber, the ap isn't worth downloading.",0
Spotify is my life... especially after I've upgraded to premium... I've my music 24/7 with me and I could never get over it.... easy access to all the kind of music and the way it can be arranged makes it a special platform to connect to music... I love it!!â¤ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,1
Been working well until I decided to update the app feels like the worst decision I have made the app won't even login my details keeps crushing or saying I have no internet access yet I have a stable connection. The only solution offered is to reinstall the app and that's a loss of all downloads.,0
"The latest update is not allowing me to play any song at all, the ads play just fine but the actual music doesn't even start playing when i click on *any* song. my liked songs have disappeared and I can't update any of my playlists either. I have no idea why it's not working and even before the update my liked songs were all gone, i couldn't access any of them for months and i couldn't like any new songs. I couldn't even stream Jimins ost. It's not cute luv, very frustrating",0
Latest version is rubbish Keeps stopping/crashing. Please fix,0
Love it great app but the app sometimes auto plays songs,1
"My review on this app is 1 start because I can't play the song that I want, when I click the song it's different.",0
"Love it, 1 They play a lot of deep cuts not just the stuff you hear on the radio I tried out a few of the other paid services and they weren't as good",0
Happy with it . Not happy with so many ads,0
"I spend too much money every month for a service that doesn't work. I've been a loyal customer for a long time. I pay for the family plan. Not sure if they are working on the bugs or not. Came on here to see if anyone had gotten a response. Crickets... I figure I'll give it another couple days, and I'll have to cancel my account. At this point, I would highly recommend finding another app.",0
"The second most recent update made the app all but unusable because the menu for playback would disappear, the app would close unexpectedly and more. But hopefully the newest update fixed the previous fix. Lol",0
Loving the premium experience,1
"The apps keep freezing, the menu disappears and you can't move to the next track or previous... please fix all these bugs",0
Keeps pausing randomly when I'm playing music out loud. Every few minutes! Then when I unlock my phone it starts again. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
It's amazing but payment is the baddest idea here,0
I like to listen to my fav. Songs. But the app gest stuck many times. So I need to clos ist and open it again. Another problem on the pc is the app does not react.,0
There are numerous stability issues with the app in June 2022.,0
"Worst audio quality in the market. It's more a social network, if you really like music this is not your app.",0
App has only recently become stable. Prior to that it required a force stop and relaunch to resume anything I had playing. The only reason I have remained is they are better than Google and Amazon music. My advice for the devs: Do Better or the second someone comes around with a half way decent product you'll hemorrhage customers.,0
Very nice to play all songs in background,1
no option to disable data access while enabling wifi access. it just ate 312 MB out of my 3GB plan for 1 podcast that I had downloaded on wifi already. can't trust that app anymore. buggy and takes too much ram to run.,0
Wouldn't survive as well without Spotify,0
It's great to use on xbox and has a cool feature where I can turn the music high and low or have gameplay sound zero or my song zero I rarely get adds using this aswell on xbox but the only problem though is that when I use it on mobile it is stuck on shuffle and way too many adds but other than that it's perfect ðŸ‘,1
I dropped a star because my playlist keep changing as I'm listening to them. I can go look at the playlist I'm listening to every couple minutes and the songs will be different.,1
So good app nice sound qualityðŸ’œ,1
"New updates brought a ""Allow Bluetooth"" screen to popup everytime I open the app. Not sure why it keeps asking permissions for things it already has and might actively be using",0
"Nice i hav fav songs( k pop songs like bts ,black pink ,exo ,txt and etc ) but ads are a bit disturbing.",0
Great for running and chilling...all my favourite songs in one place . Plus great podcasts for listening to in the bath ðŸ›,1
Love it it plays everything I want to hear,1
Lost the now-playing controls on latest update! Can't even switch it off without stopping the app.,0
Outstanding selection of tunes..,1
Perfect app for playing dope music,1
"I truly enjoy listening to the music, especially some of the oldies, it's good for when doing organizing to have such background music, absolutely awesome!!",1
Works well only with premium,1
Money by Lisa on the other playlist was replace by an unauthorized song. Fix this issue ASAP,0
"fine, however i'd like to be able to choose what song the shuffle starts at and most of the web player's features. aside from that, it's a fine app for music and playlists",1
Love the music options and sensational podcasts,1
"So much music, not enough time",0
Love it no complaints just wondering if you guys could make Resume separate music and podcast like resume music And resume podcasts besides that great app,1
"When I am paying for ad free, I don't want to be asked to rate you. Your song recommendations are terrible.",0
"I love spotify, used it for years. Just since using it on my new phone the music pauses after 30s of listening and then the app becomes unusable. Used to be great and im sure it will be after fixes.",0
It's not working properly it gets close and didn't work properly ads are too many,0
"This app has been glitching to the point that it's often unusable in my car. Also the play button vanishes periodically. Also the widget randomly stops working periodically. Will adjust review when these bugs are fixed. If it continues I'll be switching to another platform, as I am a premium user.",0
I love this app best music app I've ever had,1
Great way to listen to all your favourite music. Whenever I drive I listen via Android Auto.,1
This app is broken now. Play bar disappeared after a couple songs or after 5 minutes of a podcast. Have to restart the app every time. Probably going to be canceling our family premium subscription because of this if it's not fixed asap.,0
I really like this app. It is very easy to use. I can always find what I'm looking for and also what I do missed is the sports category for podcasts. I wish that you guys can bring that back but overall your app is really well put together,1
I love Spotify I will use this app for my music forever all the time 24/7 I don't care about the other apps this one is for me and I love it,1
Wow,1
"great app, they fix any problems that may come but ive personally only had a problem once in many years. great app thats inclusive of many Artists. they have many great concepts within the app too. definitely worth it",1
It was good but it never plays the songs that are relevent to what I like ill stick with other music apps instead.,0
Love Spotify. Great app!,1
Love the free music and library,1
Why do I need premium to listen to my favorite music,0
Spotify has all the songs of my favorite group (BTS) so there's nothing much I can ask for! Thank you Spotify!!!,0
"Hello Spotify Team, I am extremely satisfied with the app. It has all the features that a music lover would ever need. Undoubtedly it's the best music app but I think that, one more feature I think should be added is 'Sleep timer'. A sleep-timer option provided for every created playlist, is something that I was thinking about to make a request to add. I hope that you will consider my request and I apologise for the inconvenience. Thank you",0
"Wow! to be honest this is my first time ever going into the feedback writing section,I normally just give rating and leave but can I just say, I'm really impressed with Spotify services, I love how there are daily mixes and time capsules that make me feel so in tune with whatever mood I'm in and whichever music I'm into. It is easy to navigate and share to others, and also being able to hear some of my friends and followers music mixes ,its epic and phenomenal, free and better premium. WowðŸ‘",1
"Too many ads,Worst app I have ever used.",0
You can't always view video or track at what point in the audio the song is. Why? This is a problem that Amazon and YouTube do not encounter.,0
"I like this app but I hate it when we only get six skips per hour ,and when there is a song I did not put in my Playlist, I really hope that changes but overall is still good",1
Why can't I listen to a preview of a song before adding it to my playlist and why is it that everytime I try to continue my music from earlier it doesn't play the song til I skip to the next song and come back its really annoying,0
why can't I play songs before I add them to my playlist? add this feat back plss Edit: it's back :D,0
Amazing music app LIKE it,1
With the free version the first 30 minutes are add free then after that it's three or more ads after every single song. I'd rather you just put ads every couple songs instead... It's really annoying.,0
"This app does not work, song quality is subpar. Find literally anything else.",0
"You have made the play button disappear! I can't see what track is playing, not in the head up menu or in the app. What a huge oversight to make in an update. Deezer here I come. Other problem is link with google assistant. Potentially useful feature, but only seems to work some of the time.... its the promise of it playing, then not, that is the bugbear!",0
"I love this app!! You have podcasts, music, access to albums, and the artist's profile. I just dont like the add part and the fact that we have to pay for premium bc that's something my parents refuse to buy for me because its monthlyðŸ˜­ But other than that it's an amazing app!",1
Very good and very useful. I use it every day.,1
"Great, can find most non underground music",1
"This app has major link and playback issues. I use it on android OS12. Firstly, you cannot play a direct song that is shared to you via social media. When you press the green play button to the bottom right of the song title the app simply ignores it and plays whatever it wants from random artists. If you enter your savedplaylist the same thing happens. This is very biased copyright playback since the specific artists on spotify cannot get there own music played per share. Fix it.",0
This app is so good because we can play our fav songs and can sing using the lyrics also .but its too hard to skip the song because its always asking for download the premium so i am not happy of that,1
This is very very nice app I love singing and this is music This is cool ðŸ”¥ app So so so cute App ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,1
"I love this app! So easy to use and everything I search for, I find!",1
"The app always plays songs that aren't on my playlist, I tried removing the songs from my playlist but I can't find them. They're not in the recommendation either, please fix this.",0
"Latest version is buggy and crashes, the now playing bar often disappears, and controls are not visible from android home/lock screen and notification bar. I have to force stop the app to stop audio playback at times. I also experience issues with headphone controls. I'm not impressed, if this is not rectified quick, I'm going back to my mp3s and saving me the premium subscription.",0
What a lovely app of music heads off to this app maker or app maker team,1
I've started experiencing bugs where the media controls disappear and I have to completely kill the app and restart to get them back.,0
"Was a good app. Decent quality, decent interface. Definitely trying to get your money though with annoying ads, limited skips, and no on-demand play. Now it's not even letting me see what's on my playlists. Quite glitchy and needs major improvement.",0
"Love it, but don't like that songs on my queue are removed when I close the app. It didn't do this before and it's like with the new update it happens all the time",0
I Know at Free have ads but you need see how much ads you sharing I faced countinue more 5 ads that's why i am giving you only 1 start I don't know is that any problem or you are doing at know Now you can't share any ads because I am going to delete this app,0
I didn't know I would have to pay and they would still be ads!,0
Although a bit overpriced the song selection and sound quality is phenomenal Waiting for Spotify DJ to roll out in India,1
I can't even listen to ONE second of a song without some loud and annoying ad interrupting. Shuffle is also horribly trash. I DON'T WANT TO LISTEN TO SONGS THAT AREN'T IN MY PLAYLIST!!,0
Excellent service super quality nice music from all around the world,1
Great is has the song that i like and some of the recommendations show me other songs,1
"Worst app, if you want to listen ads thn listen sportify, but if you are interested in songs thn plz find another app",0
Everytime they update this app it gets worse. The layout is awful. Why would you remove the big shuffle button from playlists and make it a tiny one? Why would you remove liked song counters for artists? Why would you remove the fast scroll from liked songs? Why would you remove the artists/albums/songs/playlists categories from the library and replace it with these awful sorting buttons? The way the app worked and was set up for almost a decade was perfect and now it's awful. I hate this app.,0
"The advertising is killing me, 3/4 songs then advertising. Someone changed my setting, I don't like editing of my songs",0
Woooow It's a heartbreak lately. Spotify what are you doing ? I release music on your platform and I appreciate your efforts with the promotion. What makes me hate the new thing you got going on is pushing people to listening on what they don't want ðŸ™„ðŸ¥º and the adds come on it's not worth it. Let a a soul choose what they want to listen to don't. Seriously I don't mind the playlists what I mind is you making playlists for the souls at least let a a soul pick what the want on their playlist.,0
Great music. Easy to use. Love the feature to link multiple speakers to an account rather than having to bluetooth directly to your phone.. also really loving the podcasts.,1
I can find everything including home freeq,1
Spotify rules. It's so dam good!,1
"Spotify has been the way I listen to music for 6 years. Overall I'm satisfied with the quality but due to recent connectivity issue's between my phone and desktop I'm not giving it 5 stars, I use my phone as a remote for spotify on a daily basis and it needs to be fixed.",0
Plays songs that I didnt even add to my playlist,0
It's good but the problem when want a play a song it gives a random song that's not the title or artist,0
"you guys decided to change a few icons, which i'm pretty sure no one complained about, but won't add features we have been asking for ....... (features already on the ios version, mind you).",0
tbh Spotify is great just i wish they had slowed versions of songs like YouTube does,1
Enjoyed this platform immensely. 5stars is insufficient more Like a 10stars is appropriate for now.,0
"Dear Spotify Team, please, add chronological sorting option to ""Your episodes"" playlist (where Podcasts are saved). If the user wants to listen to a podcast from oldest to the newest episodes, everytime one must manually change the playing episode to the next one, since current sorting option lists episodes only from the newest to the oldest, and that is not very practical. Not a big deal, but such change would nicely improve the overall experience.",0
"Occasionally the podcast stop playing in the middle and exit, this happens a couple times during one episode. Add it own songs to my playlist which i dislike. Wish it was better idk what else to use and i can't update for new version because there's no update",0
My favorite way of listening to music,1
Great app but to many ads on free version.,0
"I love all features of this aap.include much album songs like ""mounam""",1
"Music stopped playing and my playlists are all empty. No matter how many times I redownload or power off my phone, it just stopped working.",0
Best app for muice ,1
"Overall, it's excellent. The one minor gripe I do have is that certain albums that I had once been able to access seem to have been removed from the library or substituted by later recordings.",1
"Can't scroll through Genres on the ""Liked Songs"" playlist.",0
bestttt,1
"Notifications, smart watch control and lock screen are broken again! The app stops playing after a few minutes. ðŸ’©ðŸ‘",0
It is unfair considering free accounts on Spotify Android doesn't get to listen to the preferred music without shuffle and to add there are ads. Spotify premium being the only way to get to listen to a specific song of choice on Android? This is a bothersome.,0
It help in study and others works to relaxing,1
Spotify is my #1 favorite application for music,1
Great and very good too perhaps even me don't have premium it's okay too keep adding more music Spotify,1
"4/30/2022: still force closes on Android. Been happening a lot lately. Not what I pay for in a premium sub. Have to fix this. 6/6/2021 update: went from 4 * to 3 bc its stops suddenly and restarts. a suggestion - you should be able to shuffle all playlist instead of one playlist at a time. Sometimes, one wants more of a variety. If you look at Pandora you can shuffle all your playlist to keep things from getting boring. It's an idea that I believe most would agree to. Good service though.",0
"Excellent app, love the release radar!",1
It is very useful to open sangs while doing other work,1
"I love this app. Since I really love music, especially Rnb songs, this app helps me to find other songs that are worth streaming. Thank you",1
Love this app! Can find most of what I want on here.,1
"I have always purchased my own music since the late 60's and was not sure about paying monthly for it. I have to say, I love getting to listen to all the music I missed out on the years I was busy raising children and starting my own business! I am enjoying going back to so many of my favorite artists and listening to all the old and new music they have to offer. Making my own play lists is proving to be very handy as well. I am happy the artists are getting their profits from their creations!",1
"You can't play songs you searched for , they play me a playlist instead of the song plus the song isn't even in the playlist ! I hidden every song on the playlist expect what the one I wanted to hear and it still won't play it and starts playing the hidden songs , this app is juts terrible , don't waste money on it .",0
"The app has all kinds of issues. Sometimes downloaded music won't load, even though it's downloaded and should just appear. I have to turn off wifi and cellular to get downloaded music to appear. Other times, when I click on a song to play, spotify plays a completely different song off a different album. Sometimes the pause/play button and the pop up screen that shows the album video and lyrics doesn't load all together. I don't understand because I have a new Samsung s22+ and I have premium.",0
Absolutely amazing ðŸ¤© so easy to use and super handy! Wide range of songs and easy to set up an account.,1
"The go to app for music in my eyes, happy to pay the subscription fee for such a great service. ðŸ‘",1
Absolutely horrible ads all the time forces you to buy premium,0
Music quality is the best!!! Can't live without it.,1
"Considering I have to pay extortionate prices a month to use this app, one would at expect it to, at the very least, work. It's become so buggy and frustrating to use, the banner in the notification centre doesn't work 9/10 times, and the app refuses to load my playlists even after restarting both app and phone many times, sometimes it wont play and other times it'll play a song but won't even realise it's playing and won't let you pause it, so you HAVE to restart. Awful UX.",0
Great app! just wish i didnt have to buy Spotify premium to listen to music for free :(,0
"The ONLY reason I pay you guys every month is so I can listen to the Joe Rogan Experience. If he leaves Spotify, my monthly subscription goes with him! Also I really like the app but it's 95% Rogan, leave him alone!",0
very good,1
"With all the choices of music and podcast players out there, it's hard to stand out, yet Spotify does and does it fantastically! I would never use anything else!",1
"No kannada songs, never gonna buy subscription untill kannada is added.",0
Player in the app keep on vanishing... please fix this issue asap,0
"Easy to use, sound is okay. They took away, for free users, the ability to pick a song from an album and add it to a Playlist. They wouldn't let you listen to it, which is fair, but atleast you could add it to a Playlist and enjoy later. Now all you can do is shuffle a artist and hope you get the song you want.",1
Had apple music for the longest time. Music wasn't the best anymore so I decided to switch. Everything seems to me just different but I like it. Changes things up and there is some songs I can't get on apple music I get here though,1
This app is ok but not the best because if i pause it the play list dissapers and i have to go back to the app. Its really annoying then your cleaning yoir kitchin and you have to click the play button,0
"Great podcasts, easy to navigate",1
"-Sometimes when I switch device phone, computer or TV when I change song I can't played it and it jump to another song or app just freeze then crash. Sometimes for no reason I just got disconnected anf need to log in when I do I have message no Internet connexion so can't log in I have to clean cache for the app, uninstall and install it and log in again. Sometimes all my playlist are gone temporarily and all download playlist offline were gone so I have to downloades it again.",0
"Overall, I'm a very happy Spotify user, great selection of songs and great song discovery tools.",1
My favourite songs!!!!!!,1
"Its astounding how everytime i load up this app, something is wrong with it. Just now I tried favoriting a new album to my library, it says it saved, but it's not there when i try to open it. I try playing any kind of music? It gives me an ad that says its 10 seconds long and then gets stuck on that ad for 2 minutes!! Of dead air!! This is why i dont ever want to try premium either.",0
"Since last update there is a Bug with the 'now playing' screen and controls missing on samsungs. I cannot do the basics anymore: stop a song or skip to the next until I restart the app completely. Please fix, and get rid of all the unnecessary features and banners on Bluetooth.",0
It's a good app and i would have given 5 stars but after new update my Spotify is stuck at Spotify logo whenever I launch application.Developers pls fix this as soon as possible,0
I pay for my premium but after paying nothing happened I still have those ads and i can't download song you already take my money you better pay me back or fix this fast,0
It's so buggy please fix it,0
"Perfect, just perfect",1
"The collections are so mind blowing and amazing. However, there is always room for improvement. Well-done.",1
Love the app but they got rid of the preview for adding songs to playlists and it makes it a lot harder along with that they label french songs as Belgiun for some reason.,0
It's all in one app. No need of other app to listen music,1
i dont know if you guys notice it but your app really loads very slow in one ui 4.1 pls fix it,0
"The best music streaming platform ever, it even comes with offline access to all the downloaded songs. Before it, l was missing out a lot, look at me now ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜all smiles.",1
Why my Spotify not showing lyrics...i tried everything..like updated it when needed.....Uninstalled and then re-installed it.....tried some tricks from you tube..but nothing worked....plz Spotify fix it asapðŸ˜­..i badly need lyrics in my Spotify.,0
Latest release does not respond to Android Auto voice commands. Correction: sometimes it works. I don't engage Spotify tech support because past experience has been only a waste of time.,0
App is crashing everytime when I am trying to play a music,0
poor customer service... Recognized there was an error with my account but refused to provide any type of compensation although I was unable to properly stream contents for weeks!!!,0
"Its the best especially, if you have premium.",1
"I do like ghis app for mainly being focused on sound and music, and i do think that the feel while looking at music and podcast gives of a interesting vibe, but i do think there's just not a lot that i can say about this app, but i still think that this is the best sound app out there",1
I've had to reinstall the app because it's been glitching for days. Let's see whether it works now.,0
Very easy to find the song of my choice..... ðŸ˜˜ Love this app.... it's quick and easy,1
"i always have problems when i try to pay for premium mini, it says unable to connect even when my internet is stable (i've tried changing my data multiple times), please fix this.",0
Easy to navigate,1
I was trying to listen to music and it played any song but the one picked,0
App crashes all the time and doesn't work. Used to like it a lot when it worked and still listen my music through it but it bugs so much.,0
Edited bc update has brought bugs. Glitches out and play bar is missing on the bottom and can't view queue. Even cleared my cache and still having issues. Please update again,0
"I like spotify but, podcasts aren't avilable where i live and also i want the mobile version to be like the desktop version(so we can skip tracks and play the tracks that we want not just shuffle).",0
It's a super music app you can get......really it's a app worth of 5 stars,1
Best place for music and podcasts,1
I just use it for podcasts. Simple and easy,1
This app is legit very good it make's your more enjoyeble but i took one star because of the add's there is no lag but the add's won't let you enjoy after every 2 song's you get a add please spotify control the add's,0
Whenever I download and log in.. it was showing me no playlist wast their go to home to find some.. if I go to home page.. still every album there seems was empty.. with same matter like go to home page.. not got 1 song to be played.. vry dissatisfied,0
"I don't like that you can't pre listen to songs you want to add to your playlist anymore, just made the app worse for me.",0
It would be nice if they would fix/update the app so the play bar would stop disappearing and we wouldn't have to restart the app.,0
Very very bad experience it only allows us to hear a particular song repeatedly....only when we have a playlist we could hear our favrt song rather than that it plays the same repeated song and from some particular movie ....it makes me very irritating while hearing the same set of song again again,0
Yeah it is great to listen music,1
Annoyingly glitchy since the android update in April 2022. Yes I have deleted and re-downlaoded,0
"Man. This used to be my most used app. I've had premium for years but the past couple months have been increasingly aggravating. First the pause button wouldn't work as expected. Then it would show the wrong song or podcast playing. Now it randomly stops playing and every couple minutes the now playing bar disappears and the whole app has to be restarted. I've done so much troubleshooting, changing settings, reinstalling, nothing makes it better. It is unusable for me currently. Shame.",0
Jebus if this app gets any worse I'm going to find a different music streaming service,0
This app is Amazing.. RecommendedðŸ‘ All Music... Easy to Make Playlist.. And the Premium Version of Spotify is Good And Cheap!!!,1
"Spotify please fix or stop shuffling the songs, I just want to listen to the music and songs without it shuffling which is why I'm using Youtube instead",0
Does not work at all! Have trouble when plugged to car and when I'm just trying to hear it on my phone it doesn't play anymore. Needs to get fixed ASAP,0
"Very good, except difficult to contact someone if I have a question or an issue",1
Please come up with light mode feature ðŸ±,0
"Bugging like mad lately. Especiay of connected to Bluetooth, you can't skip or pause songs, and it will randomly just stop playing or disconnect for no reason, on multiple different bluetooth devices. I pay Â£9.99 a month for what is quickly becoming a useless and frustrating app. Going to cancel subscription if issues aren't identified and sorted asap.",0
Where has the play bar gone?? I can't use Bluetooth or skip anything!!,0
I like this app cuz you can play country soft bra in any kind of music you like and it's a good app thank you,1
I love it. It's good to have your friends be able listen to the same music as you.,1
One of the best music apps around!!!,1
Everything made premium,1
"Another update and more issues. The playing bar disppears, so can't scroll through the songs, can't repeat, shuffle etc. The only way to bring it back is a reboot. And you're charing Â£10 for this. Maybe time to check out another provider",0
Its a very nice app but I cant change what I'm playing on my phone yet on my tablet I can,0
Everytime I use this app it works great for a few months then starts glitching,0
I don't like now that you can't pick the songs you want to play and you need premium to pick what song you want to play,0
"Best app for music, I have Spotify premium and it's worth every penny.",1
Love that you can save songs and play them when you go to the off grid house for the weekend!,1
"Love this app!!! I enjoy having lyrics available in the app, also the following features for artists and friends are awesome! My suggested music is always incredible. Spotify has opened an entirely new world of music for me.",1
Stutter issue when swiping between songs (A71),0
Excellent application and service. Have used for several years now and never had any issue.,1
Plenty of selection of music and easy to use,1
My kid lured me away from Pandora and I am so glad,1
"Spotify app on PC is great, you can't doubt that. Although the moment you just wanna travel with music on a phone its so horrible, theres this bug possibly where you're locked on shuffle mode. You can't even have fun with music anymore because Spotify does everything possible to make it unfun.",0
"Always buggy, features being added just to be removed weeks later",0
The play bar at the bottom keeps disappearing,0
"Usually this is my go to for music. Went to play some today and there are no controls. I can't skip, play, fast forward nothing! And the sound is very off. What's going on?",0
"The best music service available! It has every album of every singer I listen to include jpop and others. Plenty of gaming or movie soundtracks, and all genres. The only problem I have with it at the moment is that the music is still not hi fi, or lossless. A few years ago I was annoyed that playlists could only have 10,000 songs but since Liked Songs became a feature with unlimited songs, the limit on playlists is no longer a problem. Podcasts are also an excellent addition.",1
What a slow app..lost all interest listening music,0
"THANKS FOR THE ADS SPOTIFY, I'M MOVING TO AMAZON MUSIC B) I would've moved to amazon music looong back if i knew i would get it with my prime subscription beforehand. Anyways, not coming back to spotify anytime soon, the ads are just so annoying.",0
"So much choice, a song you heard and forgot about, you can find it again! B sides etc.. Great app.",1
other people songs/playlists will start playing out of no where while I'm listening to my music. normally I will just switch back to my own playlist and brush it off but it's been happening more often lately and its getting annoying. also the music that plays isn't even from this country.,0
"First the users were entitled to get 30mins of uninterrupted ad free music , and now u play a song u will find a ad .Just Fed up with them .",0
The app is great. U can check all the artists that u like.,1
"This is a great app for keep your music organized and clean. There is only one addition I would like you to add, that is ""Offline Lyrics"" feature. Other than that you have all necessary and useful things to be on a music app.",1
"what can I say...it's almost like I'm cracking my head to find bugs but there is almost none, except for the fact that I'd really like to see no. of streams on every song. And also, I find it difficult to upgrade to a paid plan, it rejects my Mastercard sometimes.",0
"I pay for their red competitor and yet I pay for Spotify because the experience was much premium since I like indie music from my home country, but recently I have been disappointed - same experience as the competitor if not worse. Listening to same songs as release radar is having poor quality songs, and the app never learns I don't like one band (even though I skip, hide, & remove their songs - so wish block existed.) Pls make personal customisation as great as before, it was your stand out.",0
Love this app for all my music!,1
"The ""Added to liked songs"" button stops functioning at intervals",0
"Amazing, easily the best UI and music app in general I've seen anywhere.",1
"I can always find the songs, albums, and content I'm wanting. The app is quick to start up. And I haven't had but just a few glitches or freeze ups. Finally a music app that works....",1
"It use to be really good, now I can't even listen to my music because it keeps stopping after 9-11 seconds, I use music to help with my anxiety but how can it help when I can't listen, this has been going on for like a year now, I've done everything I could to stop it for doing it but still nothing, you're a streaming app, how can you stream without the music/podcasts playing?",0
I'll give a 5 stars if you can finally let me share lyrics on instagram.... THANKS! 5 STARS NOW,1
I have been using spotify since pre 2015 and it has never let me down. Favorite music app by far.,1
"Generally good algorithm-generated playlists, but can be too repetitive across multiple mixes at times. Podcast UX is terrible. Not being able to sort downloaded podcasts by date published is infuriating, and having old episodes randomly show up in the queue is incredibly annoying. Having to delete downloaded episodes and remove them individually from the 'my episodes' list is the definition of tedium. I've stopped listening to Spotify exclusives because it's just not worth the pain.",0
I love the functionality of this app! It's a solid platform and has a great variety of music and podcasts. BUT with these recent Cancel-Cultureists going after their next target I will not sit idle and watch as they pressure their agendas on us. Spotify if you cave and cancel Joe Rogan I WILL BE UNINSTALLING THIS APP. And there are many others who will do the same. #CancelCancerousCancelCultureists,0
Sometimes the song I want is preempted by another song.,0
What. the. hell. WHAT IS THE NEW UPDATE IT SUCKS LIKE WHY TH CANT I SKIP SONGS AS MUCH AS I CAN OR PLAY ANY SONG I WANT?! DELETING THIS APP RN,0
Amazing ,1
"Trash app, ads after every 2 or 3 songs. Lucky that there's hacked spotify",0
Awesome experience using spotify !! Love it !,1
My Spotify suddenly started malfunctioning. It's not playing on my phone everytime I select a podcast and on my laptop it keeps skipping tracks after one second. I dont think something is wrong with both my devices. PLEASE HELP! PLEASE FIX! I LIKED IT BEFORE!,0
Not good having problems logging in,0
"Hello. Im experiencing an issue where when I play any songs, it will only play for a few seconds and then pause. Afterwards the apps will freeze and im unable to load any playlist afterwards. Music has been helping me to stay focus while studying, such a bummer this issue happend when exam week are around the corner. Please fix this bug. Thank you.",0
i would def rate this 5 if free users could use the premium version ðŸ¥²,0
love to make my own greatest hits sets . I wish I could still get the quick music sample so I can see if I want to add song to my play list. I will give 3 stars in stead of my previous 5,1
"Used to love it but its so glitchy now. There's no play button, I can't pause it either, have to turn my phone on and off to make it stop playing.. nightmare. Considering changing to tidal at this rate",0
Excellent place for any music,1
The session option worked much better before. Me and many of the people I know used it for parties and other events so that more people could control the que. Now it makes every device play the same music instead of one device playing and multiple devices controlling the music...,0
Perfect App  Thanks Spotify ,1
Never had a issue. Best app for music lovers everywhere,0
"It was a nice app, had premium for long time but I chose youtube music because is cheaper and you get more for your money. The song are repeating all over again no matter what playlist you choose. Without premium is absolutely awful, I don't know why anyone would choose to play music when you cannot choose the song , you cannot skip and there are so many ads... you suppose to hear the ads so you can use the app right?",0
"I can't use Spotify, either using mobile data or wifi",0
"Very buggy since last update. - Play bar dissapears, can't pause or skip songs until I restart the app - The app deletes my dowloads randomly and I end up with no music when offline - When offline the app takes minutes to load my downloaded podcasts ( this is a new almost empty memory s10+), a restart will somwtimes fix the issue Seriously thinking switching to another setvice (yt)",0
I have downloaded this app to listen to songs not your ads.,0
This would be a five but every time I make a play list it playes one that I want and then changes my whole Playlist to the worst music ever.. can you just let me listen to my music and not your weird music,0
Its great I do wish it had less ads,1
"I've never had any problems with Spotify until recently. I've updated the app, and now the song that's playing doesn't show up, so I can't even see what's playing and I can't even pause the song or skip it. I have to close the app entirely just to pause a song.",0
"The app constantly stops playing music, pausing on its own and cutting out and ""now playing"" menu dissappears, ever since April update. Used to work flawlessly. Hopefully this can be fixed soon or im gonna have to find a different service.",0
"Ads are frustrating but Spotify always makes it easy to get a trial or extend user membership. The most user-friendly app for music and podcasts, in my opinion.",1
I dont want Spotify anymore the extra song ruined my day,0
"The only reason I moved to Spotify was because Joe Rogan moved to Spotify. Thank you for protecting freedoms and airing independent thinkers. This cancel culture is going to backfire, and you guys will have been the platform that did not cave to the craziness!! Thank you!!!",1
"Couldn't delete from all devices fast enough, worthless service.",0
"it always say ""unable to connect"" everytime i wanna buy premium even though the signal is pretty good",0
"Needs to better support Android 12 (S) OS update. Unbelievably slow now when opening the app. Definitely feels worse and more laggy then in the past. The app could also use a bit of a re-fresh design (nicer, smoother transitions, a new ""now playing"" Ul page). App UI is really starting to feel stale and static. Spotify for Android, could sure use some TLC. Needs to be brought back to live. Feels lost.",0
What happened to the podcasts? I used to be able to select one and it would take me to the last episode I listened to. Now it just starts at the top and I have to scroll through 300 episodes to get to the one I was on. Not cool.,0
PLEASE FIX! We are losing the play/pause button and have to completely close out of the app to get it back. The music is also playing over phone calls or any videos. Please fix asap tired of my ear drums getting tortured when I go to answer a call,0
"It's awesome, you just have to get premium ðŸ˜œ",1
New update ruined my Spotify! I have used this app for years. I pay for Premium and I download certain Playlists. After the update my playback pauses and I have done all the usual and recommended things. Please fix this or I will have to find another way to play music and podcasts!,0
The mobile version SUCKS.. like you cant even find a song and lusten to it without it making you listen to a whole flippin playlist full of songs you dont want to listen to.,0
Mal-ish AF... comes on (hidden) randomly. Great content though (the reason for any stars),1
Deleting due to irresponsible/poor content oversight. Spotify needs to do its part in the war on reality.,0
Great apps! Looking for wider international collections of songs that help us be connected more as global citizens thru music.,1
"So I've started uploading my own music onto Spotify. I was able to listen to my first song just fine but now I can't listen to any of my songs. It's not that it won't play, when I press the play button it just straight up plays a completely different song. Is there a reason I can't listen to my own music?",0
Bass volume song quality is appreciative,1
Change name to ADDIFY.(Only Adds for free users nothing else ) Put 2 min song between 1 hr of Adds. Good strategy to get new premium users by irritating them.,0
Too many useless ads. Also crashes frequently.,0
This app is so nice i listen my fav song and my fav artist i follow them i like spotify so much Thank you spotify,1
"I'm quite dissapointed. I want to play my playlist but it only plays songs I haven't added! I have over 15 songs so it shouldnt be playing recommendations. There is no point in this app if I cant even play the songs I want.ðŸ‘Ž I cant think of anything positive that makes this app stand out. Disgusting, horrible app. Would never recommend.",0
So far I'm happy with the app - it gives good service..keep up the good work.,1
it plays music. what more do you want.,1
"Spotify has stopped playing on my mobile device and keeps telling me no internet connection, despite having a good internet service. I hope it is rectified as I am already losing interest in the app.",0
"after leaving a glowing review recently, i must edit and say i am so unsatisfied with the content of joe rogan and his posse of morons and spotify chose him and support this maniac over neil young and joni mitchell and the other countless artists that are bound to pull their catalogs over the reckless lies and misinformation that i am as of this moment deleting spotify until further notice that spotify has done the right thing. Deleting until they fix their mistake. thanks.",0
To many ads!!!,0
"If i could give zero stars i would This app is a piece of garbage ware on Android extremely poorly optimized constantly deleting my downloads and slower then molasses, its not because i have an older phone because well i don't i have an lg g7 thinq and when i first downloaded this hot garbage of a music app and payed premium in 2018 it was still bad and they have had almost 3 years to fix it and they haven't -10/10 Update I got the new google pixel 6, love the phone, Spotify still runs like s***",0
Now playing bar continues to disappear and becomes unresponsive to ear bud touch controls,0
Have to uninstall EVERY TIME I want to play MP3s stored on my device. When Spotify is on my phone it forces me to use it to open my personal MP3s but it fails to open them and crashes - so forced to uninstall Spotify every time I want to listen to them. Cancelled my subscription as a result.,0
"Excellent music especially in a lockdown in car, at home, on the beach...... everywhere!",1
Super annoying now! What's going on? Music just stops playing. The song bar gets lost and i can't even go to the next song if it is playing. I have to close the app and restart it too many times in one single day. Please.fix.this! I don't pay premium for this.,0
What is going on with Spotify lately.. my download isn't progressing at all... I've got tones of space and clear cache.,0
"Edit: It's 2022 and still no quick toggle for offline mode. Also, restarting my phone makes me lose my downloads everytime, so I have to download 5000 songs times and times again.",0
"It's alright, it still has it's little inconveniences though",1
"Hi premium user here. Your latest update for Android has broken Bluetooth connection for pioneer head units again. Please fix, thanks.",0
I can't read lyrics in some languages so I think lyrics should be in english,0
"My original review was about the removal of the search tool. It's back now which is good. NOW they've removed Spotify connect support for JVC/Kenwood stereos! Can't even browse music or like songs from my car stereo anymore - just says ""Connecting"". STOP REMOVING FEATURES and actually add something... Something interesting for once! Tired of this constant deleting of features and moving things around.",0
My experience is very good because this is the only app I used at home during work . Hearing podcasts and songs are cool ðŸ˜ŽðŸ†’,1
I really like this app I use it everyday my only two problems with it is the security there's no settings option for security there's no two Factor authentication short. 2FA I really hope two-factor authentication will be released very soon my second problem is some songs go out of order and they have no information as to why it's unavailable and when it's going to be available again some of my favourite songs are unavailable in Spotify and I can't think of no reason why it is unavailable.,0
"Great music listening app. It can be buggy from time to time, but I've had issues for awhile. Video/podcast interface could better. Like have audio only mode, and scheduled downloads for new episodes.",0
"Love Spotify, but it's hardly usable at the moment. Extreme amount of bugs. Says I don't have internet when I do, won't play music when clicked on, when it does play music I can't see what is playing or make it stop unless using a force stop. For the amount of money we all pay for premium, you should have no problem paying people to fix the bugs?",0
So far it has been a good experience. Decided to become a paid member. Long comutes makes this app a most. Love how I can make my own personal play list with songs I want.,1
I'm kinda lazy when it comes to tech. So it def works for me.,0
"Why there's alway trouble in offline mode. I literally can't play downloaded songs. What's the point of FKN ""offline mode"" if you still need a FKN Internet connection ?",0
"Great price for a great service. Love, love, love",1
"Why should I download offline and I won't be able to view the lyrics unless I switch to online mode. If I use Spotify, it's because of the lyrics Please work on this. The lyrics should be downloadable offline. Treat as URGENT until then it's a 3 star",0
"Loved it for podcasts until something changed and now it acts as the default player on my phone when I try to play audio files from my download storage. Worse, it doesn't actually play the files! So bye bye spotify.",0
Very powerful application has all the songs in it.,1
Excellent!! Travel with me all over!!! Easy acceable.....Best 70th gift from my children!,1
"Music is great, but they allow for misinformation spread through their podcast service... So time to delete and use another service.",0
I love Spotify it has so much good music but it needs to add more xxxtentacion songs,0
Spotify gets me there with a smile Always 6days a week Spotify keeps me smiling on my daily train rideA-train BklynNY,1
"It's, good and perfect for listener.",1
Amazing experience with Spotify and very reasonable prices for premium account And people need to understand whats good doesnt come free u have to pay atleast Spotify is letting u listen to music on its platform without paying any money and you get great quality sound,1
"I have tried Apple Music as well as YouTube Music, but I found myself coming back to Spotify because it's recommendation and sharing features are superior. The quality of songs available is also better though I can't be a 100% sure about that.",1
New to Spotify... So far so good.,1
"I love the app and premium and have been using it for years but for some reason now every playlist automatically goes to shuffle even after I keep turning it off. Please fix this, it's really annoying.",0
Best app for listening to music and chill,1
Works well. Easily connects to my sound bar.,1
"Its very good app for music in this app almost all song are available, so download and hear songs",1
Good audio quality,1
"Too many advertisements, it spoils the vibe",0
Content with the app and all it provides The history of the bands and individuals of the bands is great for a better connection to the music I listen to,1
This application is awesome. Just it takes a lot tine to load even with full network.,1
Very nice I give it a 10/10,1
Constantly cuts off on my Z Fold. Driving me crazy Edit: also what's the point of downloading a podcast when you can't play it without internet connection? Just to take up some extra space on my phone?,0
"Podcasts freeze, cant pause or rewind, have to keep uninstalling the app to stop a podcast. Will canx subscription soon if it carries on",0
"The app will not show what is playing, and there will be no notification or way to pause it! This is unacceptable for a service I pay for. I will be looking into YouTube music. Also You cannot swipe up or down the now playing bar like you can on ios and in youtube.",0
Spotify does a good job. ðŸ‘,1
"Love the quality and ux of this app. Also, the student discount is a plus!",1
"When I first got to use Spotify I thought it was great. Then,the ads started to appear. I understand that they have to make money but there are way too many commercials.",0
Everything is great except for buffering/skipping on liked songs that are downloaded.,1
very good to use haha my teacher always took my phone but it's okay I still can connect my bluetooth earport and listen to the songs in this app lol,1
"Great app, I'm a big music guy so I use this app almost every day for hours, I have not experienced any glitches at all.",1
Adds irritating continuosly.. rest is good.,1
"There's too many ads, granted I'm not paying for premium",0
I love this music and podcast app,1
"The functionality of Spotify on devices such as Android Mobile,and Amazon Tv is excellent! there's a wide variety of music for everyone,creating playlists is simple,quick,convenient and multiple versions of the Spotify interface are user friendly tooðŸ‘",1
Really not functioning well as of late. No longer shoes previews when I send or receive a song. Just spotty at best lately and most of music is downladded. My downloaded songs should be cutting in and out. I have the family plan and really considering switching service to a competitor.,0
"Nice collection, Auto play songs is too good ðŸ‘",1
I'm very happy with spotify. Music speaks to my soul & Spotify has everything I need.,1
"Bro if your gonna increase the ad in between the music, and irritating people your gonna lose a lot of people. One add between 5-6 songs is okay and done. 2-3 ads btw 1-2 song is crusome. I love Spotify, so don't compel people into premium or else they will go in search of other music apps with free and less ad",0
Can be buggy sometimes but it doesn't detract from the overall experience the app provides.,1
"I love a lot about Spotify. But you updated the group listening sessions this year and it is absolutely TRASH. It's dependent on networks and external listening devices. Half the ways to join a session no longer work and the QR code is now external to the app. Previous to this the group listening sessions was perfect. One click away, easy to scan to join irrespective of the device used. It was great and I told everyone I knew. No it is so clunky I don't even know how to do it half the time. Fix",0
"So now we can't fast forward or rewind anything we are listening to? What happened to the little bar to do that with? Also even after the new update it still does not allow you to select the next track from the lock screen like a pop-up window. U have to fully unlock the phone to change the track, please fix issue it is very annoying having to unlock the phone to change the music.",0
It's OK but I don't get to listen to the music I want or save it without paying every month.,0
"The only thing on here I use is music. That's helped me through findig out my husband has pancreas cancer. At the moment I am listening using the 2 month free trial, sadly, due to the above cercomstances I will have to cancel my subscription at the free triles end. Thank you for helping me through this hard time! Truley, Michael",0
it was a wonderful app. in this app we can enjoy unlimited songs.what a wonderful app.,1
Fantastic app. Have always had a great experience with this app and have thoroughly enjoyed using it. Always got the music or the artist i was looking for. Great work for that. Have been facing some issues lately though.. l don't see the music controls for some reason when i play any song on any playlist. This is something annoying because you don't get to stop or pause your music untill you restart the phone. Please fix this. Thanks.,0
"App is broken. The play/current track bar doesnt show so when i play a song i camt pause it, or rewind or skip to mext song.",0
"I've been using this app for a very long time but now out of nowhere, I can't preview the songs before I add them. Why is that?",0
Used Spotify as premium and non premium for a few years now... All of a sudden I get 6-8 ads (30 seconds per ad) every 2 or 3 songs.... Getting rather unbearable... Please sort this out.... Its getting a bit irritating... I don't mind a few ads or even 6-8 ads each 30min length but it's 6-8 ads every 2-3 songs or approx 6-10 mins (song length dependant) Getting to the point of account closure and delete now.... Please fix it.,0
Too much ads and cant play next song,0
"Should section off playlist we created from added playlists. It constantly disconnect me from facebook and my friends isn't visible or updated. Even when my friends are visible, what they are playing isn't updated. The songs that isn't English, example japanese or chinese have reduced significantly.. Even english ones are no exception.",0
"As others here have mentioned, the app is quite buggy. Constantly stopping playback for no reason, playbar freezing, and play button refusing to start songs. I'm currently looking for a different streaming service as Spotify refuses to ammend this issue and its gotten to the point where I spend more time fixing the app than listening to my favourite podcasts and music.",0
It bugged my first playlist so I have to do all these extra steps just to listen to it. It's very Irritating.,0
One of the best seamless listening experiences ever.,1
Absolutely ðŸ’¯ % fantastic for music of any genre looking forward to the moment I move to premium.,1
Its nice to be able to preview songs in your own playlist again,1
"Why does the app just randomly start playing, this gets annoying. Please make a change in the android app to have an option to turn off autoplay.",0
The widget is inactive after closing the app,0
"Everytime I get in my car, the app starts playing even though I've turned off the autoplay/connect. It's not so bad when I'm listening to music, but for podcasts it means trying to find where I was when it decided to start playing on its own. This has me seriously considering any other streaming music service.",1
"a pretty good app, and theres a fair amount of adds without premium.",1
Good except when the app will randomly stop working and won't let me play a song or album,1
Last update mess up the play now control bar,0
"I love it Its perfect I'm a tree climber and I stuff my old device in my pocket and up I go !! And the premium 8s freaking sick !! Some times I'm cutting in the middle 9f nowhere and can't even get service. No worries, because I still have music . ðŸ¤™ thanks spotify ðŸ™ ðŸ™Œ yall are freaking awesome. And hell if yall could shoot me a free month ðŸ¤ª I'd really appreciate it",1
Fantastic Quality.. Amazing music collection!!,1
"It keeps getting worse. Covers stopped loading a while back, it is awful at detecting transition to offline mode, then at times won't play songs previously downloaded. Now it insists on shuffling all my playlists by default. Sigh.",0
Absolutely loving Spotify. Lots to choose from .,1
Automatically plays music when the app isn't even running. No option to get this to stop. Had to Uninstall to get it to quit. Garbage app.,0
"Latest update has removed a lot of functionality - can no longer access the song playing in the play list, so cannot stop shuffle. Very frustrating and disappointing.",0
"Why is it so hard to pay premium, you want us to subscribe or not. Really frustrating and not user friendly at all",0
"Good selection of music and podcasts, terrible execution. Surprisingly Spotify, I don't what you adding whatever songs you want to my anxiety playlist and stopping me from skipping them. I get that you need cash so I can deal with the ads, but I shouldn't have to pay just to have free choice of music.",0
I would really like if the lyrics of songs would be in English sincenwe have trouble reading lyrics in another language for Korean and Japanese songs,0
Too much advertisement. Things must be in a limit but it is going out of limit. I'm not taking subscription that doesn't mean I don't exist. Why so much advertisement is there,0
They show me always ofline ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ worst app and soo Many ads in itðŸ˜¡,0
Spotify sucks. Zero cooperation from the app. Horrible.,0
"There's no point, I had a recent review but I realized I was being too generous, the creators are GREEDY, Just coming up of ways to FORCE users to buy premium, they don't even give you a choice, why even make this app free?! The moment I press shuffle on my playlist a ""Suggested song"" plays AND I DON'T EVEN LIKE IT, and the ads aswell, I doubt creators are even looking at reviews, If I could, I'll give this app a -10/100",0
Great app. I use it to remenber ols songs. Muy satisfecho.,0
I don't like how if you want to listen to a sertain song that you can't cuz it is all on shuffle.,0
"Your app sucks... The autoplay doesnt work, I get to hear more ads than music... And I don't understand that why does the autoplay have so much issue... Update: The Auto Play still sucks... Update 2.: Now the app refuses to start... Update 3: Player has become buggy... Update 4: Repeating songs in discovery queue... Update 5: Your App Player is dead...",0
This app is cool but is a glitching my album but the martin garrix problem in songs in fav There song is 1. Follow 2. Limitless 3. Reboot 4. Good morining And why is glitching the song??? Can you fix the app but i updated to one ui 4.0 is ok is to litsen i like ot really cool IS BLACK DESGIN I LOVE THAT! (â‰¡^âˆ‡^â‰¡),1
This app is awesome but but the only problem is that after 1-2 song u will see ads of 5-10 and that's why i got frustrated and I am going to uninstall the app i will returned problem solved please spotify fix it !,0
I love music ,1
"I loved this app but recently when updated I cannot play songs from the playlistd that I made and when i press the play button it says that I get only 6 skips per hour. I mean like ""WHAT THE HELL"". I want to play the songs in an order i have set my self. Not mixed. And whenever i play a song spotify premium keeps coming off. I'm deleting this song until this is fixed. Until then Bye.",0
I am using this app for many years now.. but recently I couldn't find the songs of a particular artist in their official playlist. Like there are only 8-10 songs when they have made many songs. Please fix this!,0
Best App ever created in this world 5 star without any doubt.....if u have a doubt then go duck yourself... thanks...,1
Worst app. They are forcing people to buy premium if someday didn't buy it they will showing ads continuouslyðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬,0
"Used for years, never a major issue. Only problem I have now is I struggle to find new music away from the algorithm.",0
Haven't been able to use it on mobile for a week since the last update!,0
Cool app,1
It is one of the most beautiful applications I have ever known It is free and contains all the songs that I listen to,1
I hate this so much. I don't even get to listen to the songs I want to listen to because I don't have premium. I want to listen to something else and it plays a different song and won't let me play the song I want. Currently crying because of this.,1
The audio of the songs is not consistent. Some are too soft i can hardly hear.,0
I'm a premium user but when I download songs and set my internet connection off then I can't able to access the songs I downloaded it will automatically restart the downloading when my data connection is on! Please don't waste your money on Spotify Premium Is The Worst App And I Need Refund!,0
Where the hell has the queue button gone?! Please bring this back,0
Im a premium user and whether I download or not Joe Rogan podcasts have a 30 chance of working Everything else is fine except this Thank goodness he will be on other platforms soon so I can leave this,1
Excellent music app,1
The perfect streaming platform although I'd appreciate if the stream together feautre was made free,1
"Getting worse by every update so laggy and even tho i have premium i cant listen music when i dont connected to internet, my whole library wont update and be useable without internet even when i opened offline mode",0
Excellent at all times,1
This is a best song ðŸ‘Œ spotify,1
Very nice ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ†—ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ good app for lisen music,1
Poor app Can't login through any of the options Tried several times After a week stil not able to login No response at all,0
It is a great app for music lovers.It is better than YT Music.,1
Very good music very reliable service I enjoyed very much,1
Good,1
I wish I could give it a 5 but the longer you use the app the more often it feels like adds play if you dont have premium Its a bit frustrating not being able to listen to a singular song but I do like that it gives a playlist based on the song I usually dont like the songs it shows but every now and then Ill hear a good one The app also glitches now and then not playing or just not showing up on the lock screen Premium is totally worth it though cost and all 65 with premium,1
Its a great experience if you have Spotify premium on your phone you can listen to your playlist anywhere,1
"When I was a full member I had no issues. Played what I wanted when I wanted. Now that I have less time I use the free option which for free, is Fantastic.",1
"The app is great! Nothing wrong with it, it's just all the ads- before 2021 there were always one add every like 10 songs. Now it's like 3 ads every 5 songs- And not everybody can afford Spotify premium.",0
Absolutely love spotify,1
A lot of choices easy to use,1
Thank you spotify for all music freeðŸ˜Š,1
"I love this service! Where else can you find all of your LPS and CDs, all on one service. I JUST LOVE IT!!",1
This app is a very good for music i have no problem with it of what so ever and i encourage everyone to try it,1
Its good for musics but you need Patience to wait until the ad is done,0
To much ads. But the app is best. 3 stars because of ads.,1
"This app is great but the thing is that I would download all the song that I like or a play list but if I go offline the the song and the play list i download cant be open and it keeps logging off, at it keep saying â€œ the Playlist is emptyâ€ like for goodness sake please fix this :(",0
My most fav music streaming app... Absolutely love it. I have no negative feedbacks abt it so far,1
"I have the premium plan and I can't get the app to play today at all. I've cleared the cache. I've Uninstalled added it back, nothing. It has been acting wonky lately. I'd hate to give it up for Apple music but I can't go on like this. ðŸ˜”",0
Spotify is good when ur on a road trip & u have no reception,1
"Spotify is also good, related to sound graphics and popular songs. It is similar to Esound and i recommend both apps to be better in songs and playlists.",1
Great app. Appears to have most of the music I like. The only difficulty I've experienced is downloading so I can listen offline. Any tips?,0
Very easy to use and works well.,1
"Amazing app if you have premium, without it you're really limited on use though. Still with premium there are some anoying bugs like: the playing bar not showing or music cutting in and out. (Android 12, One UI 4.1)",0
Very good experience with spotify,1
"While ads are indeed annoying, the most annoying thing on this app is that it adds songs to your playlists without allowing you to remove them. I've tried hiding the songs but nothing works. Not only that but the limited skips are a true pain to many users who can't get premium.",0
I been paid users have family plan for many years and lately this app crashes lot!! For price should be having problems with it.,0
"App glitches when running in the background and if you pause with the Bluetooth command, you can't play unless you open the app. Sometimes podcasts pause for no reason. Sometimes the podcast keeps playing, but the ""command bar"" at the bottom disappears and you can't go back or pause. For all these reasons the app has to be closed and reopened frequently. This has been an issue forever now and I don't think the dev team will ever fix it.",0
"Awesome, fuan and easy.",1
The current updates Spotify app still does allow you to swipe across nor does it show its running you have force the app to restart or restart your phone never had any issues with the app till lately hope it gets fixed it's becoming a pain in the butt if its not resolved I will move over to another music platform,0
"Very solid app. Recently lots of issues with freezing and not loading albums/playlists at all, requires a force stop to work again.",0
"Music for free!!! and song's you love,plus it recamend's music of the same johnra,come on",1
I love spotify but I hate how many ads there are without premium,0
"I'm getting tired of all your YouTube ads back to back, and just your ads in general are way too long",0
"Ya. Latest update is very broken. You lose audio controls, and must terminate the process and restart the app. Big fan of Spotify, but this release was not properly tested, and has gone far too long without an update with a fix. Recommend to all to downgrade to the previous version until Spotify puts in the work.",0
"""Shows you might like"". NOPE. I don't listen to podcasts. Stop shoving them in my face. I don't know what I'm paying for. Music recommendations are horrible.",0
This is by far my favorite music app ðŸ¥°,1
I love it but sometimes i can only go back 3 songs,0
i will no longer be using Spotify unless it is my only option because I can not listen to music on my phone using Spotify because it shuffles the music.,0
Spotify I'd great and all but recently for some reason I can't listen offline even tho I've downloaded a playlist,0
Amazing Love how it connects to car radio automatically,1
It is the best music app I ever had.,1
"Im happy for this app because I no longer struggle to play myself favorite music,im always updated than with other applications i was struggling.i love it too much.",1
It's nice but on phone it mixes everything,1
This is amazing i can karaoke in this app and i can do listen my favorite songs,1
"The app is very nice, I mean better than the other music streamer apps. It has everything a gamer wants. It has relaxing music to calm you down while having a battle and it also has music to motivate you when you are about to lose. For example- I was loosing hopes because all of my squad members were dead and I was the only one alive then a motivational song played from my playlist and I finished the whole enemy squad",1
Great music selection,1
"Spotify has had all of the music that I have ever wanted to look up, no matter the genre and plays with no problem. I live this app!!",1
We spend most of our day listening to our favorite songs on Spotify. The recommendations algorithm picks the songs perfectly to the mood and the type of songs it picks is just incredible. Most of the time we get surprised byhow it picks the songs to our taste. Annual plan is a bit expensive but its worth taking it for the quality of music Spotify offers. Finally we fell into deep sleep listening to the soothing songs. Spotify has become part of our daily routine. ðŸŽŠðŸŽ¶ðŸ˜ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ¶ðŸŽŠ,1
It is not working well like previously it is working good there is laag when any song's are playing... Fix this!!,0
Same songs keep repeating,0
I really like this app. I can find any music I look for.,1
It was wonderful I loved it. It had many lovely songs,1
Love thiscapp great music and podcast selections,1
Always improving and substantially more evolved than AM. Bring on Spotify HiFi.,1
"I hate it, too many adverts, they just keep getting in the way of listening to the music. I have uninstalled it already, about a week or so ago because it was too annoying. I will spend a few hours copying the playlists I have in my laptop onto my phone and listen to music with better quality sound from now on. I cannot score zero for any apps unfortunately but this definitely gets a huge zero from me.",0
It is good app but while listening song suddenly the songs stop by itself and I need to open the app and the play the song,0
I love the app it was working really great for me for 2 months now it's running like s***,1
it a nice song,1
Spotify doesn't stop playing when alarm goes on,1
Pretty reliable bad cell service or not,0
Multiple options for content... All top notch,1
I wish it would play more of my original voice material..,0
Still certain music categories such as classic rock & metal are missing the bass & now the app is failing to connect to android auto these past 2 years have been ridiculous can't connect can't get the audio correctly it seems they're getting to big for their britches & neglecting there customers we're paying for a subscription we should continue to have good quality like we had 2 years ago all i'm asking for is fix the problems and give us back the quality we used to have it's all we ask,0
Fantastic and smooth functioning.,1
"Since last update, podcasts stop literally every 10 minutes and the display screen is gone so you can't skip forward or back, view queue, add to queue. It's currently unusable.",0
They charge me twice a month and won't stop when I ask them to. Terrible customer service.,1
Pretty much the best streaming / offline music app around.,1
Always has exactly what you are looking for! Old & very new..... Plus you can't beat the family bundle deal! ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,1
It was good at first then it went down hill I can't play the music I want without getting songs recommended to me and I have to just sit there and listen to it instead of music I want,0
"Excellent app, outstanding music quality. I love it ðŸ˜ðŸ’•",1
I have not been able to use Spotify for 3 days now as it is not connecting to the internet. Please fix this asap,0
It's simple enough fast and good app can play all track.,1
It become more sad and unplayable because some of my liked songs turned into unplayable and if they turn they play next. I hope spotify fix it on the next update and also the super anoying adds that pops reapeatedly.,0
Love the offline mode and ability to download playlists. I just realized I could upload music too.,0
Easy to find every sing I want. Couldn't be better for a free app,0
"Really , Spotify is a best music app",1
"Love Love Love Spotify.......got all my old faves as well as expanding my musical palette with new music suggestions......much better than the ""other"" music service......... Got a fan of Spotify for life......ðŸ‘",1
It is a nice app but it i cant access the premium gold because there is no payment option like Mpesa which would be more easier to pay for the premium,0
Sound quality is horrible. Add suport for better sound formats!,0
"Looooove me some Spotify! Obsessed with music for almost 35 years and this is my favorite music app, hands down. ðŸŽ¶âœ¨ðŸ’œâœ¨ðŸŽ¶",1
Your support is so trash it makes me want to switch to YouTube premium,0
"Ton of people having the same issue, randomly stops and doesn't have the control bar at the bottom. Yesterday the controls disappeared and I stopping stop it playing without force quitting the app. Not good enough can I undownload the last update?",0
"Best thing that ever happened in music, they just need to add music videos",1
Its nice and overwhelming,1
It adds songs it thinks I will like to my playlist automatically and there's no way to turn it off.,0
Really wish Spotify would listen to us. Adding songs to a playlist should be effortless.,0
Good variety of artists and playlists. User-friendly.,1
Very very buggy and the UI can be so much better. Give podcasts its own space in the library,0
"Since the last update I can no longer connect Spotify to my Google home system. I've tried reboots, relinking, and reinstalling everything. Other music platforms work just fine, but not Spotify.",0
It's great all my favorite artists under 1 app ðŸ‘Œ,1
I love the app just don't like that fb messenger makes the Spotify page freeze or glitch needing to be refreshed and sometimes it skips during songs like a old CD lol. I like the set up in general great for sharing and finding all kinds of music ðŸ¥°,0
Sometimes has troubles loading up pls fix that,0
Can't use the search option anymore. Keeps on saying 'No internet connection' while my internet works just fine. It's getting impossible to use Spotify with all these bugs. Please fix it.,0
Offers a very wide and eclectic selection of music.,1
"Nice ,best app for music lovers",1
"I like how this app has almost every song, but the problem is that whenever a few songs in my liked list finish, a random song starts to play and I really hate that. I wish it wasn't a thing, and since I only have 6 skips I can't change back to my liked songs.",0
"It is so amazing I love it, it is exactly what I hoped for, thank you for reading my mind. I have a great experience, I had no idea I would fall in love with it ""Spotify"". I definitely recommend it for every one. though I sometimes get jealous ðŸ¤ª. I'm enjoying the experience please I missed an offer you gave me earlier on the past few days, it had 8 days for me to accept but when I checked, I could not find it, so please can I have it back I need to accept it. Please. Spotify is the Thing.",1
"I've been using Spotify for a while now, and a premium subscriber so no ads. It's a pretty decent app. The problem I have with it is the random genre of music that is thrown into your daily mixes; with no option on the app to delete or change your preferences. They'll say keep listening to your favourite music and it'll change over time, but it doesn't. It gets pretty annoying real fast when you're seeing recommendations constantly from genres you've never listened to. Please fix this.",0
"I used to love listening to music with spotify it really helps me when I need it, but now theres way too many ads. I get to listen to two songs then five ads right after and it's just a constant cycle. They dont even give the option to listen to 30 minutes ad free anymore.",0
Love the new update It is amazing now that you can turn off suffle getting premium atleast for me and which songs are next are amazing thanks for this update Spotify it was very much needed keep up the good work,1
Newest updates make it crash 1 second into any song/podcast. I have to restart it 2-3 times for it to work properly everytime.,0
Love the app. I've been putting off signing up for premium but love that Spotify kept Joe Rogan. Immediately signed up for the Premium family plan!,1
Update removed lockscreen widget now I have to unlock and find the app to control it when i share to my roku tv it cuts out after2 minutes... I'm about to go back to pandora.,0
"It's been my streaming platform of choice since 2016 (at least), every update it's just as intuitive, the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because, sometimes, it can reset my downloads out of nowhere, and that can be inconvenient since I'm always on the go and in a need of music, other that, wouldn't change it for anything.",0
Great app but one thing don't like is that it doesn't let me list to eminem and I mad a Playlist just of his music to see if it was just my other Playlist but no I doesn't even show the music on there it doesn't show any music and I have already have updated it I just want to know if eminems music is not available on Spotify any more.,0
"Way too many ads i literally once got 11 ads in a row. It's honestly ridiculous, if you dont get premium you have to sit through 2-4 ads after every 3 songs its annoying and makes the whole experience suck. I get really overestimated sometimes and I have to play music to calm down but the ads really make it so much worse, especially if the person speaking in the ad makes mouth noises. There should be a way to at least flag certain ads so you don't have to listen to them.",0
"They play suggested songs that I really hate, and never stop doing it, because I am a free user they don't care, so I will take you out. What a way to ruin a experience, hope you get out of business.",0
im using spotify since then and i enjoy it because i can easily jam with the song because of the lyrics but now im kinda disappointed that my spotify doesnt have lyrics on... im always updated with my payments but why yhe lyrics on is not working anymore,0
"So disappointed in this app. I installed it to listen to some podcasts that are only available on Spotify. I thought since I had it I try listening to music on it. Boy was that a mistake! It will only Shuffle the playlist, it adds ""recommended"" songs in the middle of a song that's already playing & now I can only play music that I have on my phone in Spotify - the other app I was using no longer works. It will only play some of the files and not all of the files that used to play. Uninstalling.",0
"Car mode is broken, screen doesn't stay on",0
Great music collection,1
"Just don't give much adds,hv some more dynamic options for adding songs in queue.",0
"All of a sudden stops working. Have to reinstall to fix it. Pita. Support was garbage. Still use it, just wish they'd fix it.",0
Sound quality is great...,1
Listening music on this app is a kind of enjoyment which multuplies your happiness. ðŸ‘,1
Easy to use and very popular so it has a wide selection of music,1
"The songs are great..but when I go on tiktok,it normally shuts the song down but now it stops and keeps playing when I don't want it",0
Horrible when I make a Playlist it always adds songs I don't care about or don't like,0
It is way easier to work and workout with no looking at my phone,0
"I Wish there where less adds, and I also wish we could choose the songs we wanted to listen to. But overall Great quality music and podcasts",1
My favorite place to listen to music,1
Recently I have been noticing that when I pick songs they play for 8 seconds and just stops. It doesn't start playing again and if you try skipping back or forward in the song it still doesn't play. If you skip to the next or previous song they maybe do the same thing but if you go back to the first song and try playing it it will not play at all. Does anyone know what's happening or if there is a solution?,0
Buggy for a week. Stops randomly.,0
I'm giving 1 star until they regulate the volume level of commercials in between podcast. Do I need to blow up my eardrum with my own money?,0
Among us. Nah but fr it's pretty good just annoying to use on mobile if you don't have Spotify premium.,0
"I'm enjoying being able to select songs that are meaningful to me, with the choice of selecting which artist I prefer.",1
"Amazing app, premium has been very worth it but for the past few months since March or April I keep on getting bizarre pauses and break ups when listening to music downloaded or streamed. App also just crashes too. It's gotten unusually buggy recently and hard to use, would be great to get this fixed",0
Its a good app but im on my phone and it's like after about 10 songs in a Playlist it plays suggested songs instead of the rest of the Playlist and without the premium after the 6 skips you cant skip no matter what please fix that in pandora if ur Playlist plays a song u hate then u can close the app open it again and a new song will play instead of the old please make it like that instead of having to listen to the same songs after the 6 skips then why ads after every 2 songs please fix those,0
The app turns itself off while playing. I tested it on a few different devices and it does the same thing. I hate it. And no I'm trying to cancel the trial and I'm jumping through hoops because I can't find out how to do that. I triple hate this freaking app,0
"Terrible app, would only connect to Internet to take my payment details but not for the service it offers. Waste of time",0
"K well I pay for this bugged app and now it isn't coming up with the bar where I'm able to pause or switch songs, I can't even like songs! This review will remain like this until Spotify fixes this error so I can actually enjoy my music once again.",0
I love this app BTS all songs available for Spotify ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ,1
"Every since the more recent update, you can no longer preview songs (or atleast I can't) unless it is added to your playlist. This makes adding new songs to playlists a struggle as without the preview it is a borderline impossible decision and adding it to a playlist just to find out you do not enjoy the preview/song is a long time for nothing. Please add the preview back </3",0
Whenever I hear an ad on Spotify I vow I will never use that product,0
Latest app update...wow the app is so broken! I have paid for it for many years. Its pretty useless atm. Juat constantly crashes and no play button appears!!,0
love the service but recently ive been having a lot of issues with it not displaying the song im listening to. like i can play music but i cant pause it or see it in my notifications tab,0
buggy app for Android it shows advertising page after pressing dimiss it directly goes to current song playing page after pressing back it goes to advertisement page again so we stuck in a loop where we cannot change song.,0
I love all the k pop music and different styles of music for all ages and they're just awesome.love it 5 star,1
"Like using the app, but please the premium adðŸ¥º, it's too much",0
I dont like how I can only shuffle play which is really annoying since my playlist gets messed up every time I play it but the addition of random songs to my playlist is even worse so now instead of spotify I use youtube for my music.,0
"Who came up with this update, Neil Young? It's absolute trash now ðŸ—‘ It was fine before you did whatever it is you did. Playlist are gone, can't see what's playing, Bluetooth unpairs, random stoppages, canceling subscription today.",0
I need you tell you that please increase the sound quality like other apps the sound quality is low in the premium membership also. Apart that everything is perfect.,1
Enjoy the music ðŸŽ¶ options they have.,1
It is amazing that you can listen to music and not get hacked on your account,1
Not one single technical issue and Ive been a premium customer for three years Reliable and smooth,1
I love this music app!,1
"Terrible, why am i payin for premium and i can't download ANY playlist",0
No other streaming platform can compare love Spotify,1
Really love Spotify. Classical music for concentration keeps me focussed at work and music for deep sleep helps me at night.,1
Nice App for music...Many songs I found which I forgot.. Thank you...,1
Thanks for helping me. Now i Fun with Spotify. thanks again best music app ever. personally recommend this app to music lovers. And don't forget to try primium feature.,1
Fix this not working right! I've had Spotify for many years! It is freezing up entirely to much for my liking! If it continues I will have to forfeit my plan,0
"If you're reading this listen to ""The Official Podcast"" they're amazing and moisty is there",1
Gotten really buggy lately. I notice it when connecting with my car through Android auto. But then also sometimes when I'm just trying to switch songs or Playlist it just bugs out and crashes,0
"When Spotify is on the shuffle mode, it shouldn't repeat a song until ALL the songs have been played.",0
Radio doesn't work even after restarting everything a few times. Didn't play songs for more than a few seconds until I've restarted it.,0
Great music that you cam play anywhere. Easy to find your favourite songs and set up a play list.,1
"Enjoy music and selection, no grips here, keep it up, love ya, later Spotify.",0
Great lists of music to listen to,1
Spotify is great. Great variety and easy to use. They provide a great amount of variety for music. Also the podcasts are vast.ots of options and things to learn.,1
Unlimited music what's not to love about that yes there are big names missing but given the catolog size this is not the end of the world plus a great source for podcasts. I can't tell you how many artists & pods I've discovered thanks to this app (easily 1000's),0
The app has been extremely buggy lately. The now playing bar has disappeared so many times while the music is still playing.,0
"I'm giving it 4 stars, not 5, only for 1 reason. You can't select multiple songs at once to move in or out of a playlist, which means if you wanna build a playlist, it takes a lot longer than it should. It should be the same way your Gallery works, how you can tap and hold to move many pics / files at once. Other than that, spotify is awesome. Having millions of songs at your fingertips for the price of 2 starbucks coffees a month? Worth it =)",1
"one profile randomly added songs of an artist named 'pesukone' into my playlist which I have not shared with anyone except my brother and a cousin. I blocked that profile. However, when I checked my playlist today, there was an other account named 'emma' who added songs of the same artist 'pesukone'. I blocked that account as well, however I was not able to report both of the accounts. Please explain the reason, esp if they are some kind of hackers or idk",0
There is no option to download single song. Download is available for full album Only. So add icon to download one by one song.,0
I love the app but lately when it changes itself to music similar to a playlist it changes to completely different type of music. Completely RUBISH!,0
Bad ui not working smoothly on fossil 5 . Lacks some important features,0
Great music. Thank you.,1
Able to listen to varieties of music and simple to use,1
Why i cannot payment for premium after upgrade apps,0
"I love this app! Its so good I always listen to Japanese music while on Duolingo to help myself better understand it and use it in my free time to play other songs! Great up but its a bit unfair that you have to pay to download music, I'd understand if it was a majorly downloaded song but not songs that aren't as popular. Other than that I would say its good.",0
"Former Premium subscriber. Canceled account in solidarity with Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and other artists who believe that Spotify should serve music fans, not pander to an obnoxious and dangerous lunatic fringe. As a music fan, I feel betrayed by Spotify. As for the app, what can I say? It's a platform for anti-science right wing propaganda. That's a deal breaker.",0
"I don't need to say anything. This is the best music app, ever. made.",1
Good just long ads and to much ads I'll skip probably 1 so ng and I'll get about 3 to 4 ads,0
Amazing app sound quality is also good but pls show less ads,1
"There's way to much ads, besides a want the old version where you can just click the song",0
"This app has a nice discovery algorithm. I would pay more, monthly.. To be honest",1
Podcasting is still so bad on Spotify. Hard to find new shows. Still no on and off switch for video. Just bad design.,0
"I like it but I'd like it better if there will be romanized lyrics in foreign song like Korean,Thai,and Japanese",1
Excellent layout for ease of use. Thank you!,1
"Literally the most STUPID and USELESS app ever!!! It never plays the song I pressed,you can't skip songs,..If zero stars were possible that would be my rating.",0
"Getting endless ""Going for a drive?"" notifications. Makes me want to uninstall the app and cancel my subscription.",0
"If not for the ads it would be the perfect app, obviously if you spend money to remove apps it's better but then free comes with a cost..",0
Very nice and gives me no stress day..,1
Current version keep shutting off says Spotify trying to play... 4/11/22,0
What's playing now doesn't show up anymore. Can't get the app to play more than 2 or 3 songs at at time,0
This app is completley STUPID i try to play mc mental but it just turn into another song I NEED TO SPEAK TO THE COE THAT MADE THIS STUPID APP,0
New problems arise every time. I can't remove songs from my Playlists,0
"Good music app overall, I'm fine with the ads if you dont pay, but the fact that spotify ads random songs to your Playlist even after you've added 15 songs is annoying and causing me to uninstall the app and switch back to my ipod, they also limit the amount of skips you have that way you can't skip the songs randomly added to your Playlist",0
"Used to be my go-to app but since this last update it won't let me transfer my files to my data to my SD card, my data connection is NOT very good so I download my most listened to music for offline hence the SD card but now it doesn't work so 1 star... You will belucky if this app remains on my phone",0
I love yall but.....now i cant grab the Bar on the side to fast travel thru my music ðŸ˜—... issue started wen i updated the app,0
"I have trouble because I consider it a challenge to navigate without the ""help"" site! Otherwise I enjoy it !",0
I like this app. There are so many songs in this app. but some lirics are wrong.,0
I couldn't open my Spotify account anymore!,0
I try to listen to my music then out of no where a whole other song off of my Playlist this app is passing me off,0
The best music streaming app i've ever used. There is'nt any problem about it. The ad player is so good as it doesn't interrupt me always but in several times. This a good solution for your need of music and i recommend this for all the people.,1
"The only issue I have is the gapless feature, it works on my phone really nice but when I transfer to my google speakers or in my car it doesn't work at all.",0
Very nice app but please return the enhance button for liked songs,1
Hey there's a recent bug where Spotify decides to not count as playing however it will play audio. Becomes irritating because you cannot stop the audio without swiping the app away Pixel 5 Android 12 AT&T Make sure to reply when you fix so I can put this back at 5 stars,0
"Spotify can go to hell!! I only use spotify because of Joe Rogan!! I would rather listen to iTunes or Amazon. Joe, get rid of Spotify and build you own Podcast platform.",0
I absolutely love this app! However it is starting to have alot more commercials than it did when I first listened to it!!,0
The so takes forever to load playlists,0
Like the ease of picking out songs to make my own Playlist and the connection to my Bluetooth when I get in and out of car.,1
Vad,1
"Good app. But somehow, it doesnt remembers the songs i searched.",0
"I love everything but there is an odd behavior from this app. It tells me its downloading 45 out of 50 or something like that and when i open it, it just opens spotify i would like to know what its downloading so songs i dont like are not appearing on my list wich is not often but true i pick my music not you. Thanks for reading this if you did otherwise i love everything and pay for it gladly. Bless.",1
A very good app... Can be compared to youtube..,1
"Great selection and integrations. Point loss for UI though. Could give users more control and could have more features, especially in the podcast space. Automatic podcast downloads being the first thing that comes to mind.",0
"Turned autoplay off, yet, it keeps turning itself back on. Uninstalled.",0
"I wish Spotify didn't constantly show up in my Samsung phone notification screen. No other app has this behavior. Every time I go to my notification screen, Spotify is there showing a play bar and the last song that was played. I've tried a bunch of different things (including turning notifications completely off in the Spotify app settings) but it always appears.",0
OK,1
I love this when the songs play I feel calm,1
Music app it its best. Go for it,1
Same complaint as everyone else you play A song it will go for about 1min then it stops for a min and then starts again.also the play bar a the the bottom to start and stop the sings dissappear something meaning you have to close the app fully and restart it. You can do better stop drinking coffe and get it fixed you don't get paid for nothing,0
Great app! A loads if music and fun! Thank you!,1
"I actually like it but earlier when i want to play a song on my playlist idk what just happened cause you can't pick what song you want,you can only play randomly.",0
I can't access my music or podcast on the app even with premium. When I go into my playlist none of my songs are there but on the Web player and desktop app the playlists show without any problem. Also when I try to access my podcast it says that there is a problem with my Internet connection and I know my Internet isn't the problem FIX YOUR APP!!!,0
"Most recently I turned on the app to find the pause unpause button pushed all the way to the left for reasons unknown, so now I (right-handed) can't pause or unpause music with one hand! If this was a bug, how do I fix it. If this was a conscious choice, why in the holy vegetable patch did you want this? Who does that benefit? Edit: Messaged Spotify support, it's apparently intended for some reason, and impossible to change! So yeah, guess Spotify gains a secondary function as a juggling app.",0
Awesome music app. Spotify as everything I want to listen too.,1
Brilliant and easy even for a pensioner,1
Everyday is amazing because of spotify. I got able to go to different places thru music. Thanks spotify.,1
This is one of my fav app back then but now I'm getting irritated because it keeps playing songs that's not in my playlist and mixed the sings per album when I play it.,0
"Only plays the specific song you want only with premium. I have to ""buy"" the song if I want to play it.",0
"Fine for music, terrible podcast player (I'm a paid subscriber). I can't count the number of times I've had a podcast stop in the middle and either be marked played, or jump to another random episode. This has been going on for quite awhile now and has happened countless times on multiple devices. Too bad this is the only way to listen to Rogan.",0
"I love how I am able to link with Shazam for easier playlist additions and am able to retrieve playlists from years gone by , when they were erased by spiteful ex. Thx Spotify",1
"At the beginning i was listening eveything i want, now i can't listen anything???",0
Great application to my music world,1
"Great, Listen to any music you want to, absolutely fantastic love Spotify.",1
#NAME?,1
When I try and put a song it ends up turning into sexy moans or weird songs ðŸŽµ and I hate it and I tryed to change and it locked and switched my phone off so I would say DONT downloade this app it's super bad and PLEASE give it a bad review! IM DELETING IT AND PUTTING IN 5reports and it doesn't let me listen to my fav song even though I pay every month I'm unistalling,0
"It's a brilliant app for streaming musics, listening to songs, podcasts and audiobooks, stories etc..",1
Stop giving too much of ads .I had 3 adds in just a single song. Very bad experience,0
Great app 10 out of 10 not a bot I swear,0
"The best way to listen to music. Premium is fire for a low price. Everyone listen to new levels new devil's by polyphia, also pentakill",0
I can listin to music when i open the app then close it it still olays music on my home screen,0
Through out the day Spotify decides to stop whatever podcast episode I'm listening to and start another one. Randomly switching between downloaded episodes to streaming audio and video of another episode I haven't downloaded. On top of that it doesn't remember where I were in the episode I was listening to so I have to go back and search where in the episode I was. Infuriating as I can't always access my phone while listening through wireless headphones.,0
"I downloaded Spotify specifically to listen to the ""Science VS"" podcast. Due to spotify's stance that it is taking with Joe Rogan and the spreading of misinformation, I am now removing the app for my phone.",0
Been using Spotify for years now. I really can't fault it ðŸ˜Ž,0
"Easy, fun, great music every time. My favorite music app. The only one I pay for. 10/10",1
Very nice and easy to find and listen to music :),1
Have alot of trouble with Bluetooth. Also keep dropping out.,0
Very nice app,1
You can find songs old and new and lyrics are provided as the song plays...that's just one of the many likable things on spodify...â¤â¤â¤,1
"Great platform, very easy to select tunes with the option to shop artist.",1
The play/pause bar has been going missing for months. Nothing done by tech. Playing downloaded songs requires changing setup to off-line playback. That's dumb. Its because I don't have internet access then that's why I'm playing only downloaded songs. Switching back and forward is tiresome within the app. Needs a do-over. I just want to play music and not get annoyed by the app.,0
"Latest update keeps crashing. Then the music starts up suddenly later, which is super disruptive and has happened at work! Doh! Player is missing at the bottom. Using Android",0
"I don't know if this is just happening to me or to other people too, but whenever I download the app on my phone and try to log in the app won't let me because i'm 'offline' and I know for a fact that I am connected to wifi and online. I've uninstalled the app countless of times and reinstalled it but it says i'm offline every single time",0
"Easy to use n large music selection, allows use with streamdeck, everything i need it to do, it does with ease",1
the only issue i have with the app as of right now is that my downloaded songs glitch and show they arent downloaded anymore please fix this other than that no complaints,0
"I like Spotify, but why does the free plan force you to play music on shuffle? That's dumb. Why should I have to listen to a bunch of other songs before I get to listen to the one I wanted? You do realise how dumb that sounds, right?",0
"Ive been forced onto this. I pay for it as family want it. I hate the shuffle. Albums and playlists are all shuffled. The UI is too simple, you can't seem to configure it to play in another way. Also I play an artist and it adds in others, please no. Bring back the superior Google Play.",0
I so love the fact that I can play at the background,1
"Ugghhh... Im not a complainer but PLEASE fix all the recent glitches. Used to be a great app. I pay for premium now but can't take this forever. Most common issue: Often just black screen when click open and app won't even start (daily, have to restart phone, other apps work fine) Currently I'm in Offline mode (via settings)& locked out b/c it won't let me log in and says Error, you're offline! play button/shortcuts don't work anymore from pull down generic/phone menu (works with other apps)",0
"This may come as a shock to y'all but not every Bluetooth connection means I'm in a car. They're wireless earbuds, stop with the constant car notifications.",0
Add to queue option is absent .,0
Great selection of music and easy to use.,1
Could be better if I can look at more Of same type of songs from the group that I have chosen,0
Great blues and country,1
"This app is incredible. It's very very good to use and I am enjoying my music everyday, every minute and every seconds. I love it.",1
Excellent music experience,1
I think its a good app. But its unfair that the program isnt that good as the one you pay,0
"I liked it a lot until it fell BACK into 'no downloaded music available when offline'. Advice? REINSTALL + you'll lose all. Here I'd like to kindly ask why should I, who pays for the premium version reinstall so that your app does the MAIN think it was sold to me for and that I bought it for? I'm sorry, if I see it wrong way but to me as it's 2022!, it's your app, I pay - you fix it. Am I wrong? And if then please, why?? BTW, I did no changes in settings. It used to work and it doesn't now.",0
Very good at finding track and listening to,1
Good app. Though you probably need to pay for premium to get better usage.,1
"Definitely my go to for music! So many options! Sometimes the driving mode messes up, won't let me look at the current track to like or pause if I back out to look at playlists. The bar at the bottom disappears. Also the audio skips real quick on every song just a few seconds after the song starts but that just recently started happening. Other than that it's awesome! Got all of my play lists and favorites downloaded so I can listen to them even when I'm camping and don't have service!",0
Great app works well. Use it everywhere. Easiest music media to utilize out there.,1
"Spotify you HAVE to FIX this right away!!! As you can noticed we are many users very UNHAPPY with this AWFUL lag since the last update. If it is for free well, it's free BUT THE ONES WE PAY FOR A PREMIUM SERVICE **WE ARE IN THE NEED TO GET WHAT WE ARE PAYING FOR , THIS IS RIDICULOUS , IT IS ALREADY WEEKS SINCE THIS IS HAPPENING WE DEMAND A RAPIDLY SOLUTION TO FIX THIS ISSUE OR WHY NOT YOU DO A REFUND TO ALL OF US FOR THE DAYS THAT YOUR PLATFORM IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY?",0
keeps putting stuff on my playlist,1
"I've been an avid Spotify user for years, however I cannot help but agreeing with the bug reports of others. They are truly numerous and prevent you from listen to your music in a clean and organized fashion. Tidal can do it properly why can't you Spotify? The bugs in the beta were already but enough the fact that they actually made it to the alpha is disappointing. Cutting out music, disappearing downloads, offline play that doesn't work, and even the inability to access ones playlist. C'mon.",0
"Never plays the songs that are actually on the Playlist I selected, even when I search specific songs it plays ones I don't want. On the rare occasion it plays the song I do want to play, it only plays 3 seconds of the song. If I could rate 0 stars, I would. YouTube is a better app for music than thus garbage",0
Easy to use and good customer support.,1
Amazing such a great app and so much choice of music,1
I try to play a song that I always listen to and it plays something else not the song i want to listen to at all. I can go right to YouTube listen to it without no problems on YouTube at all.,1
It is an amazing app... I can't go a day without using it! Worth the subscription 100%...however have noticed that the app sometimes freezes and I have to restart it....,0
"Most enjoyable, finding songs from many years ago that I loved and still do",1
So many songs to choose from and making playlists is super fun and easy! Use it everyday!,1
"Lovw it BUT PLEASE fix the fact that when you add a song to your liked songs it won't change to a green heart most of the time and when you press again it doesn't remove from liked. It stays empty and keeps saying ""added to liked songs"".",1
"The app is very very boring to use. Ads pop up after every song or two. For every 5 minutes of use you have to hear about 30 seconds of ad. I have been using this app for about a year now but I have been disappointed by this app and hope you too. Until and unless you have the money to buy premium, I recommend you not to download this app. It really just sucks.",0
"Great app, love it i use it everyday. But sometimes my volume gets softer randomly.",0
Good ,1
Everything is good except for the adds. They give just too many adds,1
"It's very useful app, u can get lyrics, podcasts, sermons etc .. with subtitles, very convenient to use and can also avoid going through unnecessary videos unlike in YouTube..... I'm glad there is Spotify....",0
"I really enjoy using Spotify, the only thing is the ads. I'm okay with it and it's understandable that they need people to buy premium for income. But ya'll need to stop giving me ads after 2 songs cuz it's hard for me to listen to a ad in the middle of being depressed.",0
Very good and pretty easy to use,1
Best music streaming platform I've used such a clean UI and easy to use I recommend Spotify,1
Very happy able to find and enjoy music I haven't heard in a long time,1
"it was quite amazing, I appreciate your work",1
this sucks. When i try playing a song it plays a different one. I've been trying to fix it for 30 minutes and can't -5/10,0
Does not work on Wifi. It is frustrating.,0
"Play bar disappears and you cannot skip or pause playing episode, only way it comes back is with a force close.",1
"Spotify the service is great. Spotify the app is terrible. I woke up this morning and discovered all my downloaded podcasts were gone. Prior to that, i would be playing one podcast but it would show a different one in the window at the bottom and if i wanted to play the one it was showing, it would continue to play the wrong podcast. The app has all manner of frustrations if you're trying to use it offline, like download podcasts to listen to during flights or driving.",0
"Best music app, easy and the upgrade is worth it",1
Lots of options and simple to use.,1
Nice,1
"The ads are getting to much and are annoying, the app stops on random, which I have to re-open. I am basically repeating what everyone already said.",0
"Love using Spotify, I do wish however they would consider adding an audio boost option for those of us with hearing loss. I'm HOH, and my old mp3 files from 2010 that still exist on my phone today will play with a very noticeable increase in volume versus streaming music from spotify. It almost sounds lightly muted when using headphones. That is my one and only gripe about this app, and I hope they attempt to accommodate this demographic in the future.",0
It's an amazing app but keeps randomly undownloading my music and when i try to edit my playlists it wont save even if i have wifi,0
"If you want to search and play a specific song in this app, it does not play, another song from that album starts playing, automatically.ðŸ˜’ I think this aspect needs to be taken into consideration.ðŸ’¡",0
Nice music updates but only if you put the option for downloading mp3,0
It's a very impactful app with different contents of interest,1
The app is wonderful I love it and it gives me no problems,1
Mind-blowing very lovable app for me ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜ðŸ¥°â™¥ï¸ðŸ”¥better sound quality and minimum ads which is good â˜ºï¸,1
"Love the app, have had it for years, but I just got a new phone (Galaxy S22), and since then when I use Spotify, my queue doesn't pop up when I start listening, I can't pause or go back and forward in any podcast or song/playlist. Obviously this is annoying if you want to check how long is left on a podcast or song, or missed something that was said now can't hear again without starting over, or worse needing to pause for a variety of reasons. Please fix",0
good app for nice song,1
On time and always on point,1
Excellent service good choice of music,1
That is a good song app and game play with kgf song nice ðŸ‘Œ,1
Lot of ads,0
Greatest Musical Experience outside of a actual live experience of course but to anyone looking for a better music listening and learning experience come to Spotify,1
"Glitching real bad. Couldn't pause or rewind, would randomly stop.",0
Too many ads,0
"I think it's great.Unlike some of the other music apps,it does not stop everything you go out of it.Nor have I been pestered constantly with ads.",1
Oh its a nice app thats all i want to say,1
This is the best and most simple music app,1
Best app for music.. periot,1
"The App has been awfully laggy as of recently. It suddenly stops playing music,cuts out,etc. If it carries on,I will cancel my subscription and switch elsewhere.",0
Continuous playlist. Diversity and full entertainment,1
"Iâ€™ve been a Spotify user for a long time, but just this year Iâ€™m having some discomfort using Spotify. My internet network is very good, but itâ€™s hard to play music",0
So easy to get the music you really like.,1
"Constantly crashing and playing the wrong song or podcast episode I choose. I click on one song and it will cycle through others on the playlist or album and not even play whatever it lands on. When it finally does play the right thing, the time bar is either wrong or not moving at all.",0
"Im on here all day, fast, inexpensive, all yhe albums and music I love",1
Umm it was great before but currently there's too much ads and the limited skips are kinda annoying.... Overall it's pretty decent ( might be better idk ) compared to other music apps,0
"UPDATE: Issue has been resolved. Spotify is awesome. I love that I can make my own Playlist. Great feature! I enjoy using Spotify. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that I can't turn off shuffle play. I have tried everything. Also, I was told that Spotify no longer takes my MC debit card issued through my credit union for payment. I have to go to the store and purchase a gift card for payment. However, my daughter uses the same credit union and she hasn't had any trouble.",1
Awesome features and sound,1
Access to a variety of music is impressive,1
An okay app but i had a lot of issues with playing music. As example the music just started to play on its own and it was super annoying and embarissing....,0
Promotes misinformation. Never worked on my phone anyway and customer support couldn't ever help. Not worth it even more so now because of misinformation. I'll support my favorite artists on YouTube or Apple.,0
Great app but I have been having issue like when I playy music the app closes it and when I open the app it won't let me even I tried everything also the 6 skips is too low to be honest especially I have to whatch 5 amount of ads which is ridiculous I hope this get fixed,0
I love this app coz I can hear my favourite songs so I give 5 star this app is very usefull thanks creator â˜ºï¸ðŸ˜Š,1
"Had premium couple of months, worked perfect, cancelled premium and it's rubbish, music stops every 10 minutes, need to go in the app to start playing. Everything is self explanatory.",0
Good ,1
"Hey Spotify, App keeps crashing on the device iQoo Z5 5G. Can't play any song. Please fix it.",0
Whenever I ay my music and I got on a another app like discord and the music just stops and I been restarting the app and my phone but I can't find out how to stop it help!,0
Spotify have became the worst app of music,0
"Spotify has been having so many issues lately. Music seems to stop playing randomly, can't skip nor pause. Something needs to be done, I'm paying for the service.",0
Its good but my favorite album just got randomized out of no where like earthquake turned into see you again or new magic wand turned into bastard,0
"Newest update made the app unusable. It deleted all my saved songs and the bar at the bottom (with play and skip songs) disappeared and the only way to get it back is to force stop the app. This happens around 20 times per day. As of April 21st this issue is still happening. Deletes my downloads everyday. Freezes constantly. As of April 25th its still happening. Haven't been contacted, do you even care about the service you offer?",0
I love the app but they recently did an update where they were giving the playlists and artists section a new look but they also change it where you can't have your artists sorted by alphabetical or recently added you can't separate that from playlist which you used to be able to do before so you could have your playlist sorted by alphabetical where as your artist was sorted by newly added or whatever and now it's gone,0
I love this app this app so cool and another song app like gana they are not good but spotify is so good I love it and put many k pop song like BTS and black pink that also so good to listen and other kpop groups are good so put it .ðŸ’œ,1
Ongoing issues with 'no internet' access despite having WiFi and data. Very frustrating and impossible to find effective help. Not worth the money.,0
Cool. Played for background while bridge ladies were here. They wanted to know about it. So I showed them that I had it on my phone. They loved it.,1
"Covid vaccine propaganda push in this app is so ridiculous, i had to give it a 1 star and delete. App is terrible.",0
"My complaint is consistent with other people, glitches for months now and has not been fixed and no refund. For such an expensive service, I am not paying for a consistently glitchy service.",0
Very smooth process to connect to my car and my devices.,1
Excellent for free that good I'm thinking going premium no more adverts there pretty annoying but u need to make money some way so I understand it ðŸ˜‰,1
It is very nice app. We can listen song with playing games also...ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰,1
"It's a great app to listen music on but it crashes or stops for a long time after every song or ad, and I don't know if you guys removed it but, now I can't listen to previews of music I would like to add to my playlist. You really got to do something about the problems, it just gets really annoying having it stop out of nowhere.",0
You guys need to really work on ads!!!!! Please reduce them!! After listening to 2 songs 3 ads start to play which annoys a lot and disturbs the whole ongoing musical mood!! Either reduce them or atleast give an option to skip them!! It's a advice to you... because you may lose many of your users because of these ads! Plzzzzzz reduce them!!!,0
The recent update has caused my app to constantly lose track of where I am with my music and disconnect from my phone controls. I can't pause or unpause until I force quit the app and restart it.,0
I rate this 1 star bc when I play my favorite song it keeps playing on different song which making me hate this app. Plss fix this,0
Spotify has become trash within the last 6 months Please make it good again,1
Best app for kpop especially bts,1
Many artists are not present for India. It'll be 5 stars once we have them. Edit: Got em. Thanks Spotify.,0
All my downloaded songs are gone somehow. Now Im unable to play offline. Worst experience ever.,0
"I'm just cutting 1 star due to unwanted adds that I've to watch..otherwise the best music app till date.. can do a lot better.. After a year of use.. I'm cutting one more star, not because of the collection of songs.. it's a fabulous app.. but as I started listening more n more through Spotify.. they have increased their selling pitch and trying hard to convert user to premium.. the ads length have increased and utsy like they are mocking users who do not have premium subscription.. this is bad",0
Good,1
"Would give a 0. Can't play anything right. The only option available to play is shuffle and play which makes it impossible play a song of choice. There's no option to edit the play queue. Even clicking on play for a single song album, shuffles and plaid random songs. Very irritating!",0
"Im not getting updates? But my other friends do get updates, they have options which i don't have and why's that",0
Im going to uninstall and definitely stop paying for this if the bugs dont get fixed asap. Music is my anger relief and these bugs are making want to switch to youtube,0
Dosent have some songs that i like but its okay,1
Love the Spotify app. Playlists recommended based on what I have played have led to my discovering some new (to me) artists that have become some of my favorites.,1
Best app ever they gave me 6 months premium for free now I get to listen what ever song I want,1
Have found virtually everything I have looked for and thoroughly enjoyed the listening experience. The play lists put together for me by Spotify have been spot on and a delight to be able to listen to old favorite music.,1
Very efficient and absolutely brilliant to listen to,1
Love the app but not so much after the latest update. The Now Playing bar disappears all the time and the app has to be reset to get it back. I'm on Android and j see lots of other users complaining about the same thing.,0
Fix the bugs on your app. I'm unable to go twice a day without force stopping your app. It dousnt stop playing and needs to be forced closed or will stop playing music randomly. Fix this,0
To many adds . After a song you get a add this goes on and on.,0
I can't even play the music I want because it's playing something else I don't like!!! Fix it now!!,0
This used- now is my favorite music app ever since they changed it back to where you can choose if you want shuffle play any song in a playlist by tapping on it and can skip as many times as you want,1
so now we cant even listen to the song we want to play unless we upgrade to premium. just great,1
Been having very bad bugs lately,0
I downloaded this for 1 reason. To be able to play music on DDJ400 but unfortunately it doesn't works anymore. Waste of time,0
"As of lately, about 2 months ago, Spotify app on all platforms when used as a streaming controller for my Google home is just beyond broken. Let me name just a COUPLE of the issues I encounter: -Skipping songs when I don't tell it to skip songs and continuing until I disconnect Spotify -Doubling songs on queue and refusing to remove one of the 2 songs doubled, or doubling songs that aren't even on queue -Not playing a song at all even if clicked a million times. Absolutely atrocious.",0
Very nice and jungkook's angelic voice our golden voice ðŸ˜šðŸ˜˜,1
Ive been using this app for a long time but recently ever time i get the 30 min of add free music the app crashes and i end up with adds,0
Its one of the best ones out there. Only if it doesn't filter streams for BTS songs too much. They did it by more than 50% last time. I only use this application for BTS' music,1
"Don't really think I want to pay a company who choices covid misinformation podcasts over a musician because of how many people they bring to your platform. Highly considering cancelling premium, I already pay for YouTube music and Amazon music, no need for a company like this.",0
Best app Recommend,1
"I love this app as I can look for just any music from any era and I always find it! Also,great for parties as you can queue your music!!",1
Massively drains the battery of my pixel 6. Terrible app,0
The only thing is that it didn't have alot of songs that youtube had.,0
Best music player in the world love you spotify ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—,1
"BRING BACK THE OLD UPDATE, i cant play a single song shuffle is sucks",0
I love it!ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ I enjoy creating Mt own play list. My family says it sounds like their at the club. ðŸ˜‚,1
I cannot even listen to the music in my playlist,1
"I just recently updated Spotify and now it's notifications is hard to remove unless I remove Spotify from my task bar, Spotify keeps on cutting off the songs unexpectedly and this has been happening numerous times despite resetting my app at least 3 whole times. And also one more thing, sometimes when I select a song, notifications doesn't pop up below the screen to show you can stop, skip or reverse the music. And I had to keep resetting the app againx2 Please fix these problems if you could!!",0
The option to play liked songs was my favorite feature of this app. For some reason that feature has been removed without actually changing the option to still play like to music. I select play liked songs and random songs play. I'll update my review when this gets corrected,0
Super Duper....sucks a little in the free option.,0
Great app but very annoying. I accidentally hit 'do not play again' because I wanted it to play on loop and now I cant play it no more and it really anoys me because this is the only app I can shut my phone off with,0
"I hve premium subs to this and GM - and not long ago, Apple. Spotify does what it's supposed to pretty well. Google is catching up as of late though. Still, Spotify is my go-to for reliable music and podcast listening.",1
"I love the variety of music and podcasts. Definitely, interested in premium. Maybe one day I will create a podcast. I would like replay to be provided.",1
the best you gotta go premium but get the family bundle everyone will be your new best friend just to get an account lol,0
All your music needs in one place,0
Used to love using this app constantly but since the new update where the video plays the songs are always stopping on me and saying they where paused. I do have premium and before it worked fine. Idk if it's a me problem but it's something I've noticed,0
It's great minus last update now you can't preview songs before adding,1
"One of my favorite apps for all thibgs podcast and music, but latley so many hickups and changes with no reason or rhym, is becoming quite annoying.",0
"Grate service, still can't get sertin songs same as apple",0
Got a new phone. Unknowingly had a 14-day free trial. Got used to it and then trial I didn't ask for ended. Now the app sucks. Poor marketing scheme.,0
"One word, Amazing!",1
"Buggy, and clearly more optimized for iOS than Android. But better than Tidal by a mile thanks to the music recommendation engine.",1
It was amazing and worth my time listening podcast using this appðŸ’•ðŸ‘Š,1
This is an awful app for listening to podcasts. Spotify devours battery life while watching video podcasts. Fix this already! Update: app continues to be awful for podcast listening.,0
"Recent update is Terrible! The new car mode now blocks inputs from my cars controls. When I tap a song to play it, there's no visual effect for me to know my touch was received. The urgently playing song is no longer highlighted, and I can no longer play/pause/skip songs within the app",0
Still the largest selection of music. Opens quickly with 0 bugs or lag.,0
"App has been weird lately. I am playing my playlist then in the middle of a song, it would suddenly jump to some instrumental music (example: Josephine Nyvoll) that is not even on any of my playlists. This has never happened before, and I hope it's just a bug that will be fixed soon. This is not supposed to happen, especially when using Spotify Premium",0
"I like this app very much. But unfortunately, I pressed the button that puts the song in the TV. And I didn't want that to happen. But now it's all good. So, thanks for making this app awesome!",1
"i wanted to try out 3 month free Spotify premium, but the app keeps saying that i already tried premium version, tho i haven't. i looked through my history, there wasn't anything about buying/trying anything. please help!",0
"Edit, dropped to 2 stars now as i can no longer just hit shuffle play from my playlist when im on it, iv suffenlu got an extra button, comparing with same version on wifes phone and she doesnt have it, seems to only require it on 1 playlist. I will fix this review when you fix your issues, i am a pod host and prem user. . You can do better than this guys, let me play my shuffle, so youve taken away people being able to shuffle albums and such because of ADELE f ing Karen . Really. No shuffle ðŸ˜’",0
"Somehow took up almost 100gb on my phone last month even though hadn't downloaded anything new, which then used all of my data for the month. ðŸ¤·ðŸ½â€â™€ï¸ Stopped automatically playing in my car AND has ads on podcasts even though I paid for premium. No thanks ðŸ‘ŽðŸ½",0
Imagine an app is 2022 that is trying to make money by irritating its users by disabling some app features on top of force feeding you ad's every couple minutes... nope thank you. I can just play my youtube playlist with the same amount of ads.,0
"I love Spotify I use it everyday, but since the last update 4 days ago some functionality is not working... constantly stops, doesn't show up on lock screen for easy pause/play/skip, and doesn't show current song playing at the bottom of the app or highlight it in the app play list. What have you guys done to my favourite app??? Please fix it its driving me nuts!!!",0
"Would give 3 stars, if not for my history with this app. Please get it back to shape. Some design decisions are hard to understand, some technical aspects reminds rather an alpha version than long developed mature application. Let me give you 5 stars back again.",0
Nice app best for music . But I want to buy premium but it is not on redeem code that's why I can't buy it plz .Make it on redeem code also,0
"Update: They brought back the âªâ¯â© AND driving mode. ðŸ’™ðŸ˜ â€¢ 3/'21: Love Spotify. Had it for many years on PC. Would give 5 â˜†s if Spotify would include itself and the âªâ¯â© buttons on the drop down notification bar on Androids for quicker access to them like it used to. It was b/c of this feature that I deleted other apps. Having to minimize all apps to reopen Spotify app, and then reopen the track just to get the âªâ¯â© menu is a bummer... I need this feature back please.",0
Please take this review as a serious feedback. Add option to report wrong lyrics or option to request lyrics. Lyrics make little unique in Spotify. Artists detailing is also not good.,0
"Okay. Spotify often doesn't give me what I search for, and when it ""does"", it often doesn't give me what it said it would. The next tracks are similar, but not from the same artist. YouTube sticks to one artist mostly, but introduces you to knew people too, so that's better. YouTube gives you what/who you searched for. Spotify plays in the background, so that's better than YouTube or TY Music. YouTube 2 Spotify 1. YT Music is basically a poor man's version of YouTube, so no point there.",0
"Pathetic. No indication where shuffle is, and only plays 10 seconds of yr 'liked' songs from yr lists that you've spent ages compiling. Then, if you do manage to play a full song, instead of playing the next on the album it plays its own recommended one for you as though IT knows you. Totally spoilt afternoon in the sun listening to what I thought would be music I like.",0
Im getting pissed off because songs that i dont like are playing in my liked playlist.,0
"There's gotta be a bug or something it won't let me like or download anything, it's frustrating, u just wanna listen to music before I have to be at work",0
Easy to get around app but music to add ratio is more adds that music,1
"Too many ads. Also, why is skipping multiple songs a premium feature? Tf? To listen to a song you like you need to pay Â£11.99 a month? I don't got much money, I think I'll stick without Spotify.",0
Spotify is a good music app with fresh n new music,1
Don't like ads,0
Great selection of tunes.,1
Live for this music app. Love it and take it eveeywhere I go. Best entertainment on the go and at home!!!,1
App usually crashes 2-3 times before it'll start behaving itself. Crashes when you play the 1st song. Getting a bit silly now.,0
Nice with premium,1
"Everything is really good. easy to use, good design, big community and song collection. Hope for better sound quality. And maybe some social features, could really raise the time spent on app. More widgets please.",1
"Used spotify for YEARS! love the platform and will be a user for life! The yearly wrap ups of all your top songs is great and lots of Playlist variety! You can find almost any song you want, even soundtracks. 5 stars!!!",1
I haven't used this app yet because it doesn't open when i press the app.. Spotify pls fix this.,0
Simple and easy navigation and listening.,1
It used be the one of the best music apps out there . IDK why now its become so buggy and experience is so lousy and hard navigate through app. please fix that as i'm mammoth music lover this experience giving lot of irritation.,0
I get ads very two songs it's so annoying,0
April 22nd: my volume reduces by 25% which is very ANNOYING. PLAYING ON LOUDSPEAKER!! FIX.,0
Too many ads. Otherwise it's a good app,1
"I like it, find new music all the time",1
"I used to love this product. Then the gave a ton of money to a guy spreading deadly disinformation on their platform. They are literally getting people killed because of this. There are plenty of other streaming services that are just as good without all that unethical baggage, so I quit.",0
My app stops playing intermittently and some times the buttons play/pause skip/reverse aren't available to press.,0
Why if I press the song I want it the result is different pls arrange this,0
"Its a good app with alarge selection of music but what is up with the amount of ads? There used to be a few ads evry here and ther but now i cant listen to 2 songs without 5 ads in the middle. I understand that free apps have ads but this is just getting ridiculous. Also the ads are so insanely repetitive, once i got the same ad twice in a row. And it was a spotify ad. Those are completely unnecessary. Premium is 100% worth it but its alonost the same price as a netflix subscription.",0
It's a great app but it pauses everytime I listen to music and it's annoying when they add music to your own playlists,0
I love this app. But. Why do i get 6 skips per hour,0
Crashes often. Won't let me listen to offline stuff unless I'm online. Just not a good app.,0
"The new update sucks. It won't actually let me listen to my playlists anymore. I made a new playlist this morning and instead of letting me listen to it, it started playing the recommended songs and there's no way that I've been able to find to make it stop. There's also no way to turn off shuffle. It won't let you click on specific songs in your playlist anymore and the daily skips have lowered by a lot. Did I use up a free trial of premium or something? Because I did not sign up for one.",0
This all is good but without premium we have to listen so much ads btw this so good,1
Nice songs available,1
Spotify is my favorite !,1
"Pay for premium but still lots of ads, what am I paying for?",0
Since the last update this app is basically unusable. It crashes so frequently. No longer showing currently playing playing song. Inconsistently overlaying in Google Maps. Embarrassing that they would go live with update like this.,0
"App is awful and broken. Podcasts randomly stop, also can no longer use skip/play/stop because the neccessary buttons no longer show up. Have to force close the entire App if I want to pause anything.",0
"I really love this app.i have some playlist but this app contains so much ads ,but I enjoy itðŸ˜‚â˜ºï¸",1
Thanks for fixing the bugs bestie,1
I open the app. It plays 1 song followed by literally 7 ads before the second song. Then crashed half way into the second song. I open the app again. Proceeds to plaay 2 more ads before playing anything. I listened to 5 minutes of ads to unsuccessfully listen to 3 minutes of music.,0
Again massive playback dramas following an update. When trying to change a song it often stays on the song playing and the change or any other attempted function doesn't register. Nor does it allow to stop the song or continue properly using the app without rebooting my phone. Uninstall doesn't make a difference. Deadset joke for a so-called premium service.,0
Love the ease in navigating. And love the variety!,1
"Cant work on mobile data for android, but works fine on wifi. Other apps work fine on mobile data. Lousy",0
So far so good ,1
"Spotify is best music app! whether with premium or not premium, I can enjoy it.",1
I found Spotify very good specially pace of music is excellent,1
Please add the song promise by Jimin of bts. Just many ad's but to music hats off. Best music quality with music in every language. Keep it up.,1
nice update,1
updated music app loud and clear tune,1
Easy to use. Not too many annoying commercials in free-bee mode.,1
Really enjoyable music channel . I have recommended to many of my music loving friends..,1
Great choice,1
Love it,1
"When you search for a specific song like song that has long title since it's an OST, results are very INACCURATEðŸ™ƒ",0
"spotify is good but idk why, maybe its a new update, but lately i havent been able to preview any songs while in the search bar. so basically i have to add the song to my playlist before I can preview it to hear what it is",0
"I don't know whats going on with this app, but I'm encountering so many problems now. The player is not visible nearly all of the time which makes it VERY difficult. Never used to have these problems. Needs to be fixed for Android users.",0
I love spotify. It says it's downloaded.. Why can't I see it?? Now it says I have multiple devices. I still can't see spotify?,1
"Awesome. Way better than I tunes, Deezer, youtube and has remained on point with each update.",1
"Spotify is okay (not great) for playing music, but it is the worst podcast platform. It's extremely irritating that there are now so many Spotify exclusive podcasts when they are so bad at streaming podcasts. It doesn't remember where I left off and randomly in the middle of a podcast it'll stop and start playing a different episode. As for music, Spotify seems to choose the cheapest option to play (weird covers or other languages) rather than the popular or desired version of a song.",0
"I have no idea why but when I want to play songs from my liked list for some reason they don't show. It says I have 300+ liked songs but I can't play them all. This issue mainly occurs in ""offline mode"". This started to happen ever since the latest update. Should I uninstall the app and try again? Spotify Im a big fan and big supporter of you but please fix this issue",0
Great station I love this app you can choose your own music and play all day long,1
I love Spotify so much,1
Awesome ,1
Many problems but gave 4 stars cause i can listen to kpop songs and you recommend me good songs of my choice 1. Not proper lyrics in tamil 2. Does not have lyrics for all songs And 1 feature I like is that the app has Korean to English translation but I have seen this feature only in Alcohol free(Twice) song.... Hope that this feature will be available to all songs in future,0
"Great music selection tonight, just a little pricey",1
Only give 3 stars caz. of adds caz they says 30 min of uninterrupted music and adds comes after every music,0
"GREAT I love this app, old and new music. I can access via my phone, car and TV. I live for music so it is great. I pay a reasonable monthy fee to remove ads. The only bug bear is I download music for the car, and they sometimes it says I need to re download for no apparent reason which means if I am out and about I can't do. Also great for playlists and suggesting similar liked music.",1
"The app has shown that I'm offline and I can't do anything with it. Tried everything I can think of, but no way",0
"Great app, but I give it only 3 stars, for a subscription which is not cheap, I have ongoing issues, with songs stopping halfway in a track and at times it repeats 30 odd songs continually, even uninstalling/installing the app will not stop this frustrating cycle. So, my favourite music with some annoying issues, pls solve this.",0
I feel like their should not ever be suggested songs it is so annoying and wastes your skips ðŸ™„ fix it and my rating will go to 5,0
It's great clear music so far no ads,1
Lots of bugs lately and now on top of that all the podcasts I'm listening to are getting removed by this censorship loving company. Thinking of cancelling my subscription..,0
"Worst platform to listen to podcasts on. It will forget where you were and start at the very beginning. Even if you saved it to your episodes, it still somehow forgets. It goes through a forced ad even though you pay for premium, it will forget where you were and start the podcast from the beginning. Saved the podcast for later? Too bad it still forgets and starts from the beginning. Close the app and open it an hour later? Still forgets the podcast and starts from the beginning.",0
ðŸŒ¸I can listen to all the music I like with no trouble ðŸŒ¸,1
"I've put off joining Spotify for years, even though Literally everyone I know uses it! Decided today was the day because I want to support companies that respect freedom of speech. Loving it so far. Will be deleting YouTube Music soon. Thanks Spotify for standing up to the mob!",1
They are not responding to any reports about hacked accounts on Spotify and sudden change of song by a musician on a playlist that's why it got removed on my playlist and Top trending hits. So incompetent.,0
Suggest for Japanese songs to have romanized lyrics,0
This app has a POS and it deletes my podcast or music three days after I listen to it just the best at being the worst it is now outdone by a string with a whistle on it at least that's consistent oh wait I believe that's also called YouTube anybody wants to use a decent streaming platform pick something different Spotify sucks the biggest of testicles honest opinion thank you I hope Spotify reads this screw your application.ps they are not number 1 in free streaming that's YouTube if anyone,0
Great app ðŸ‘. It has a lot of ads but if you buy premium it's great.,1
I was in from the beginning and researched hidden gems from the past. Still ready for new,1
Keeps undownloading my lists and skips on a downloaded podcast or song like the old disc man's. And won't stay playing if the phone shuts the home screen off,0
"Great ui loved it, you should buy premium its worth the price, amazing app overall 9/10",1
It's a great platform for streaming your favourite,1
"Love the music, hate the ads.",0
Too many ads.,0
"Verrry Good musicplayer. Connects with alexa, You can open 10+ tabs in your device and can listen music side by side. Most important, very good quality technology and music. All in all none is better than this music and podcasts player.",1
"Usually I love this app, and I've been paying for premium for years, but this most recent update is messing everything up. The app just downright refused to work yesterday, no matter what I did. It's working slightly better today but still randomly stopped working on my morning drive to work which wasn't super convenient. Please fix the bugs from the latest update!",0
Best music app except if you dont have premium,1
"Better than the competition but buggy as hell. If you want to push a group sessions feature then at least make it work. Oh also the shuffle button on playlists doesn't work on tablets. Edit 2022: now they moved shuffle to another menu, who asked for this???",0
Was given no warning/ reminder that my premium ran out. The email team needs better training.,0
"I started using the app in 2021 and I enjoyed great functionality and overall convenience, my gripe is that my payments won't go through on all my debit cards so I don't have access to premium services.",1
Everytime you guys updste a new bug appears. This time when i hit to play a song it doesnt actually show that it is playing even tho i can hear it.,0
"I got tired of my jazmin account so i decided to create another on my computer and I tried to log into my ItsPerÃº account and It keeps saying ""Password and Username don't match"" even though I am typing the password correctly. Or something like that.",0
"Still great for playing mysic, but the creeping advertisements and recommendations for podcasts I don't care about is making me consider switching to something else. UX is starting to exploit me, rather than work for me.",0
"Still learning as I go. Love hearing my favorite musician, Rio Tripiano!!",1
Constantly glitches and app wont open when Im paying alot of money for it and my family account Might have to try Amazon music,1
"Can't hide podcasts. Can't mark media as something I don't want to see again. If there's something upsetting, I can't block it. Definitely missing vital features.",0
"I've been a premium user for years and I've been mostly happy with the app. I love the customized ""Made For You"" playlists and Wrapped at the end of the year. It is a great app for music discovery. I only wish they paid artists more.",1
Phenomenal selection of song and very well balanced playlist make for an enjoyable experience every time with something fresh and interesting to discover,1
Latest update might as well been a brick. Bugs are bad. Can't see playback menu. Doesn't tell you if anything is playing. Will no longer communicate with phone notifications or toolbar,0
Best app for listening music ðŸŽ¶ Op app,1
What kind of app will not allow you to cancel your subscription and also have hardly no way to get a hold of them or sign in to do it? What a sham! I probably paid for extra months because I could not figure out how to manage my subscription because there is nowhere in my account to do so.,0
I am listening music on Spotify better music app ads free of premium good app listening of music platforms Spotify Better music and improved on app of quality good music for relaxation of Spotify,1
"Keeps crashing. When you skip ads it starts playing at a different place, basically I think just self sabotaging to force me to buy premium, which I never will.",0
Nice,1
Too many commercials.,0
Can't play Money by LISA in most of my playlists because it was replaced by another song. And many already reported this incident but it's been two days no response/action from Spotify.,0
If you listen to music this app for you lol,0
Spotify is very easy to use It's one of the best music apps out their if not best.,1
Easy to navigate & share between devices. But it doesn't always play videos,0
"Please change the payment method to be like most other android apps so that we don't need to subscribe from the web but directly from the app instead, it's much easier and we can use our Google play balance too.",0
It's all good but there are too much adds i mean not all of us can afford premium so please look after the adds i mean dude 3 adds after 2 songs is way too much . . .,0
Love the library you can build and the depth of choices but miss Neil and Joni,1
Awesome app,1
Unfortunately Spotify doesn't seem to be able to push updates that aren't loaded with bugs. Playback pauses unexpectedly,0
"The last few updates have made the app super laggy and unresponsive half the time, it's getting pretty ridiculous",0
"Lately the app keeps playing music fine showing the song and artist on my phone and my car stereo and letting me skip, stop, pause and play, then suddenly it will go off and I have to uninstall the app then reinstall, if this fault hasn't changed by my next payment due date I'll be cancelling and going back with amazon music! I'm Â£9.99 per month this shouldn't be an issue! I've seen another review so I know this is a problem with samusung galaxy phones.",0
Everything is now a premium feature I would request Spotify to make us listen to the songs by giving 200 to each song,1
"The app has started stop to play when music is ongoing. This is very annoying, plz fix that",0
Used to work well but now it's just keep playing wrong music.,0
"For some reason it stops playing my music out of nowhere, or it will stop playing for a couple seconds and starts playing again, it happens often to a Point where it's really annoying!! I thought it was my phone but I recently got a new one and it still happens",0
Amazing experience just perfer yt music better,1
Amazing it helps me to listen to song even when I'm on another app like I study maths with music so it helps me a lot best app ever seen as a kpop Stan too,1
Great to find almost any artist but what I really like is the recommendations that Spotify makes. Much of my new favorite artists were recommended so good job!,1
This one pick this over all other music apps,0
"a lot of ad... it disgusted me.. like after two song, it always play 3 or 4 ad and it's 30 second longðŸ˜¡ and also only one song and then 3 ad come 15 to 30 second long.. really badðŸ‘ŽðŸ»ðŸ˜’",0
Fantastic music experience Spotify brought to my life personal playlist the best,1
Spotify is more difficult to work than other similar platform but one's you get the hang of it it's all good from there Scotty boy ðŸ’¯ Spotify playlist check me out ðŸŽ§ðŸ’¯ plus if I make a playlist up I want to play it in the order that I set it up on its on shuffle and it's a pain when I'm trying to show my skills to the public what goes with what track after another in a selective way like it should be done by Scotty boy ðŸ’¯ Spotify playlist ðŸŽ§,0
Quality of music is awesome in this app,1
Great music and format,1
"It's nice when l don't want to watch TV I have a great selection of music oldies and modern to listen to, goes with my moods brilliant",1
I'm still able to play music but I have to use Bixby in order to get it to play anything. The app won't let me tap on anything or even change songs really,0
"I've used spotify for years but recently it's been crashing too much! Music stops for no absolute reason midway, the app itself crashes making me have to close it and reopen it, songs get skipped out of nowhere, and the worst part for me is that they removed a very useful feature! The feature in which you could go to your Playlist, click add songs, and preview the song to know how it sounds like in order to check it out. I used to really love this app and i only wish for it to get fixed.",0
I love Spotify!,1
Easy to find music and has a great selection. Love their genre play lists.,1
"The app is so buggy. Other than that, it's great. very buggy, what's up with that",0
The best online music app ever and the deal with barcelona put you guys as the greatest of all time for me !!!,1
"Love the app , although they shud let rhe ppl online have a lil more accessible option",1
Since the update music randomly stops playing and sometimes the play bar doesn't appear so you can't skip songs etc.,1
Thank you for bringing back the song previews. I can efficiently make my playlists again ðŸ¤—,1
The app is always crashing always has trouble loading podcasts. The worst is when an add comes on and after the add is done the podcast I'm listening to skips right to the end. Total waste of time,0
All good but adds are more,1
"Downloaded songs and playlists are useless when the connection is lost. No matter how many times you restart the app, it bugs out and keeps giving an ""offline"" error. This started happening a couple of months ago and never got better with any update so far.",0
Superb app with music & podcasts!,1
"Wonky with sd card, no easy way to manage downloads or see how many songs you have downloaded, no good way to true shuffle through all your songs",0
I can now listen to my favorites genre,1
"Spotify used to be a great app in all aspects, but now it fails in every department except they have the largest selection of music. The worst and most frustrating thing, is now you can't even play your DOWNLOADED songs when your offline. There is a reason that customers need this option like myself (not to waste unneeded data daily), and this app fails miserably with a ""No Internet Available"" notification that doesn't permit you to play your songs at all. I truly hope they are working on a fix.",0
"Caving, they just pulled 71 episodes of The Joe Rogan Experience. Absolutely thoughtless.. I'm only sticking around to see what the response is..",0
this app is so fun and it has great music,1
"The option to listen to a preview before adding a song to your playlist is gone , the app it's always pausing ... what's going on? ðŸ˜",0
All the options are premium,1
Good,1
"Wish the shuffle options was better, but great overall.",1
Thank you because I am abled to play the songs of my ears. This is such a plaque ready to be played anytime.,1
There's a bug where everytime I play music it crashes. Please fix the bug!,0
One of the Splendid Musical Apps as I luv to read the lyrics along with the song.,1
Good app,1
My dudes i love you but i now cant listen to music when my phones locked. Please fix and ill change rating,0
"DOESN'T WORK ON ANY WIFI EVEN AFTER BUYING THE PREMIUM, AND IT'S NOT JUST MY PHONE , DOESN'T WORK ON OTHER PEOPLE'S PHONE ALSo",0
Can you please make it easier to apply RSS links for shows I pay for? This is Spotify's weakest point,0
Good,1
Nice supper WW,1
Horrible do not get! It was ok at first but after 30 days it made it to where you were forced to watch ads and made it to where your songs shuffle automatically and you can't disable the shuffle. Worst app ever . Uninstall,0
Best for listening music but adds comes when the fav song comes ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜….....,1
Songs and podcast pause randomly with no known solution. Have been paying for 5+ years for terrible service,0
Realy nice app. I can hear music very clearly.,1
"Since last update been having NOTHING but problems! Randomly just stops playing music, doesn't show on lock screen what's playing and even after closing app continues to play music. Have to restart phone to turn music off. Fix this asap!!!",0
"Ever since I got my one person premium account all the sudden I can't access all of my music and I can't access a few other things and now Spotify sucks to me and if it doesn't go back to the way it was I'm going to ask for my money back and I'm going to go somewhere else thank you very much. Sincerely, Kim Goheen",0
After last update there is a problem in chrome cast please fix it,0
Superb,1
This has always been a good app to listen to your favorite songs all day or night.,1
"Downloaded to hear Joe Rogan podcasts, app image and sound quality excellent. To Neal Young: Bye Felicia!",1
Best music streaming app you can find!,1
"Why can't you find a full list of songs by an artist? They're obviously there as you can search for a specific track and bam it's there, but if you do a general search for an artist only 5 tracks show up",0
"Incredible variey of genre's, best audio app ever.â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†",1
"Will not shut down and keeps running in the background,even when I force stop the app.Uninstalled.",1
"I continue to experience bugs with this app. Although I will be playing a podcast, the app says that nothing is playing. Therefore, all the controls (pause/play/rewind 15sec) are greyed out. The only way to pause what I'm listening to is to force quit the app.",0
Very easy to find songs and to download,1
I love it,1
Super glitchy. No longer shows whats playing. Randomly plays and doesn't play when told.,0
I love this app,1
Works great but I'd like the option to add playlists to the queue,1
"I wonder whose bright idea it was to remove the feature of listening to the songs before adding them into your playlist, it was a good feature why did you get rid of it?",1
Amazing,1
"Doesn't support free speech. Was considering a premium account, but I'll rather spend my money elsewhere.",0
This is a great app let's me listen to any song I want with no problems except when I watch the video that suppose to give me 30 mins without ads I get an ad after my music ends,1
Soon as I lock my screen within 5 mins or so it stops playing then I have to change song for it to work. (It's not on sleeping battery saver btw) nor is it on a timer on the actual app. Its been playing up now since last yeay,0
"Editing playlists, making playlists, and even playing songs are a chore using this app. The ui can use alot of work, and the fact that so many necessary features are locked behind premium make it so much more aggravating. The only reason I still use this app are the huge library of songs it contains",0
I like being able to play music even when my phone is off,1
Spotify is a great music app. I've discovered a lot of really amazing artists on the platform. The reason why I'm giving it a 4 star is because I've been trying to subscribe to premium with my Samsung phone but I can't seem to select a payment method. Is there anywhere I can resolve this?,0
"Since the latest update, the ability to rewind or fast forward is gone. What kind if update is this? It's no longer user friendly. I've used the app for a long time & previous rating was a 4 due to app not recommending similar podcasts after searching.",0
Fresh music easy to access it fantastic thanks to the developer of this platform for great work he has provided,1
"Great, enjoying the audio books, great podcasts",1
I can find almost anything I want to listen to.,1
"Using for years now non stop pausing, I can't even listen to music anymore without it pausing every 15 seconds, I have tried everything and nothing fixes it, has been going on for months now and hope it gets fixed 15$ a month for music that keeps pausing :/",0
I can literally listen to my fav music artist but I don't like because your automatic on shuffle which annoys me,0
I absolutely love spotify. I can play any music I want for free,1
"The app says my ""14 Day Trial"" was ended, yet I don't recall any claiming free trial.",0
Would be better if you got more songs /artist you have previously liked instead of random songs,0
"I like this app,but what is wrong with it? 3 ads?! I can handle 2 but I draw the line at 3,you must keep it to a limit of 2 when entering the app and 1 as well,like I am gonna buy premium just because you shove 3 ads every 3 to 4 music played,like why?! That ain't business,rip me and those who don't own premium,but either that it's pretty fine,limit the ads pls",0
I really love this app but ad's are the issu here that's not a big deal any way I do love this app ðŸ˜˜,0
Great for offline listening great organization of songs and great quality love this app,1
Showing no internet connection even we have the connection on! So that makes irritating!,0
This so awesome,1
bring back the heart,1
Great provider.. no problems ever. Tons of streaming stuff. Worth every penny!,1
This application is good application,1
"Amazing Sound Quality , Ads is an issue For a free listenerðŸ˜Œ",1
Amazing,1
Not crazy over this app. Music box was so much easier to use and save music,0
Trash app. Have to pay just to turn off the shuffle button,0
Great app with a wide range of music genre!,1
Started making music of my own and finally got em on the best streaming app there is thanks again guys.,1
"Spotify is a great app and I will always use it to listen to music but I really hate when they add songs to your Playlist it just really isn't necessary at all, I mean it's basically their account and it's like... the government they can do whatever they want if they think it's right for you. All in all spotify is a good app and I recommend it but when you get it make your Playlist over an hour otherwise you will get random songs.",1
Please fix the bugs. I can't play the song I want. Always says I'm offline. Which is I'm not.,0
Great but too many adverts..after each track..really?,0
You start well and love the app. Wait after 3 weeks and Spotify starts to irritate you until you dance to it's tune,0
Dring AI DJ to India,1
You guys ruined Spotify. Its awful and not what it used to be. So sad to see another American freedom taken away. Time to go back to pandora.,0
"Good, I like the lyrics",1
A recent change has (once again) ruined the experience for commuters with intermittent connections (like the 8M NYC subway riders). You now need a connection to look at a playlist you already have downloaded...,0
"I rate a 1 because every night when I was trying to listen to calm music, Spotify keep adding other music that's not even in my Playlist which absolutely suck beacuse I don't even like the music they put in, there is not even a option to disable it. At least give us infinite skips bruh. Edit: there is a option to disable it but it doesn't even work.",0
"Honestly can't stand free Spotify ( it probably doesn't bother everyone as much but oh my god for me I might've deleted the app if I couldn't get premiumðŸ˜­ ) but Spotify with premium I really enjoy everything there and use it pretty much everyday. I also like the for you weekly playlists,I've found so many new songs I really like off there.(+premium or not Spotify is still the best music/podcast app I've been able to find ever imo)",1
It's pushing up to 5 ads in a row. This ain't it. More often than not it plays suggested songs instead of what I actually put on my playlists,0
"It's good . Plz try to bring me more categories like soothing,edm, nostalgia also try different languages too. Add more remixes of songs.",0
Liked playlist doesn't work first song is a liked then keeps playing song I've never heard of or liked,0
Quality music just get the premium voucher and feel it ðŸ˜Š,1
"Since i downloaded this app I've been unable to buy premium. Each time i click ""start my Spotify premium"" it says ooops something went wrong. It's been that way since last year.",0
ads are annoying ... a lot,0
"I had to downgrade the app as the latest version is unusable due to the play panel disappearing, not working with auto in car, why do I pay for this rubbish. I may look around for any alternative. In addition lots of new features irritate me.",0
Forcing us to be connected to the internet to access the music sucks. Whoever came up with this bright idea needs to have a rethink. Many thousands of premium subscriptions (including mine) will be lost over this. Guaranteed. Put it back the way it was asap.,0
Love the access to favourites from the past Gym selections keeping me moving as well,1
Excellent music suggestions,1
Great music and if you don't want don't mind the occasion occasional advert it's all free,1
"I like the app, but the ads are awful. And the 30 minutes of ad free music doesn't work. When I say the ads are awful, I have gotten more than 7 in a row once. I just want to listen to music and I am okay with listening to some ads but 7 in a row is just stupid.",0
This app freezes + takes forever to load! Really bad when you are paying Â£10 a month for a service that always lets me down when I need a song or playlist fast!,0
This app has gone from good to worse I listen to one song and I get 5 to 6 advertisements at a time it's ridiculous nobody should download this app anymore,0
Cant play music without closing the app every single time,1
Sorting content need help. Especially with podcasts,0
I've been using this app since elementary and still use it to this day and all I got to say is its amazing if I could give you guys 10/10 I would. good app ðŸ¥³,1
"Good App, I wish tho I could be able to have a Playlist of all my music in one place, like the music I have searched or played before",0
"would love if i could use the app without uninstalling and reinstalling everytime the player goes away in my notifications. seems the recent update went too far into trying to make something more of what already worked. please fix this asap, i pay for premium for a reason.",0
This app was great until a few days ago where it started to bug out and crash. There is no play bar and it only functions for a few seconds before crashing. Please fix this.,0
"About 1 per day the app bugs out and either stops playing and won't play anything unless I reset the phone, or it simply won't stop playing.",0
"It's been a week that spotify only opens if I connect it to wifi, app has so many bugs. Also there is no point paying for premium if I have to download songs again and again everyday. I will highly suggest to not pay for premium services, it only eliminates the add and you have to keep downloading songs every freaking day to get them offline.",0
Spotify is the best for podcasts & Music like when I work out. I use Spotify and I will never use any other music service,1
I love the extensive music options,1
"The service itself is great but the mobile app is infintely annoying. Most frequently I just listen to my ""Liked Songs"" playlist. I choose a song to listen to in the car then close the app when I get out. Anyone with a brain would think I'd want to continue listening from where I left off, right? So why is it that when I reopen the app, even if it's only been closed for a minute, my playlist has jumped ahead by about 100 songs? This is incredibly irritating. I would give 5 stars if not for this.",0
Why is spotify adding 2 ads now?!,0
All I use for music anymore besides the few artists on YouTube they don't have that I like,0
"Really good for music. Just wish there was a way to disable podcast suggestions or just hide them all together. Also seems to always play the same songs first when you ""shuffle"" a play list.",0
Worked great initially but then had sound issues,0
Awesome variety of music! I actually like Spotify more than Pandora! If I could give Spotify a higher rating I would give it a perfect 10!!!!,1
App has been very very buggy lately,0
I have not been able to get into my account for 4 days now it is completely locking up and not allowing me to pull up any of my music podcasts anything I guess I'm going to have to cancel my membership which is just unfortunate because I have always loved my Spotify account,0
Op song,1
"One of the best apps on my phone, so easy to use and garante has something for everyone to enjoy. I simply love spotify â™¥ï¸",1
Been having a lot of bugs recently. The player keeps dissapearing. The songs stop playing more than once. And then they just JUMP to the next song when they're not even 3/4 done with the first song. Please fix these Bugs. I pay for the service and have for 4 years so to have so much disconnection due to the app that was working fine before is dissapointing.,0
Im really happy you can preview songs before you add them to a playlist again!!! like it was 3 stars without but like ahhhhhh yes. makes making playlists and discovering new music a million times easier! (i have premium btw),1
Pretty good app. Would rate it better if I could thumbs down songs I don't like.,1
"One of my favourite app, they provide good experience on listening music, podcast, instrumental, i am just so happy with it ðŸ˜†",1
"I am 74 in years and it was my 45yr daughter who introduced me to Spotify. I am not good at understanding this 'new age technical stuff' but I found it relatively easy to get around in. I believe this App is the BEST thing to come out using new technology. I will spread the word around other Seniors, and encourage them to at least give it a go. Thank you, and well done. S. Veale. 2022.",1
Its nice to use premium but sometimes when I have a playlist downloaded sertain songs will undownload them selves and stuff. If that could ve fixed I will be very happy and make my rating a 5. Thank you.,0
"Subtle inconveniences, such as opening a sponsored ad for a specific song, then not hearing that song, instead shuffled songs from that artist. Algorithm is a little weak compared to SoundCloud as well, doesn't quite pick out the right genres, I might be wrong though.",0
It's great fun you can listen to the best music and play games at the same time as listing to music but there are to many ad verts,1
It's amazing...just don't have the premium yet...but it's still fine,1
"How can you not give 5 stars to your own personel jukebox for $10 a month! As a music fanatic from a very early age to playing guitar for almost 40 years, this is the greatest thing technology can do for me, in my car, at home, on my phone, and they even have my album on here! ""KEGASAURUS WRECKS"" c'mon man! Thank you Spotify!!",1
"Same is happening again now, see issue below. Love spotify. I am using premium. But if I listen to any songs that are not 'liked' songs and I lock my screen it stops playing for anything from 5 seconds to 2 minutes or it completely stops until my screen is unlocked again. Phone make and model: Samsung Galaxy S10+. If this is not sorted by December I will be canceling my subscription, need uninterrupted playback during the holiday season at the beach :)",0
Been using Spotify for almost 10 years now. It never disappoints. I consume probably 95% of all my music and podcasts on Spotify,1
It's horrible for phone it always plays songs that I don't like when I try to play a song in my Playlist and most of the time I can't even listen to a Playlist because when I click play it plays a random song not in my Playlist. When I search up a song and click play it plays a random song which I dislike even more.,0
"Most recent update means I play music, it will start playing but I have no controls and then I have to shut down and reopen the app.",0
Premium Version is the best!,1
"The apps keeps crashing anytime I try to make a Playlist, and even then I can't listen to a single song or podcast because ""my internet connection is not responding"" or something, it says as I play YouTube videos just fine. Even created Playlist appear to be empty. Every. Single. One. If I try to make a Playlist and it doesn't crash for some damn miracle as much as I add songs the Playlist it stays empty... and I really wanted to use this app, fix it or lose my money.",0
I'm giving this app 4 stars because I wish that it had the option to add music (albums) to a certain playlist. It's so time-consuming to add singular songs from an album to a playlist.,0
Great service to discover new music based on your tastes,1
Great songs you can't anywhere else!,1
This song app is very usefull app and i listen all the songs without any subscription thanks spotifyâ˜ºï¸,1
"So it's not just me having problems then. I used to pay for premium but stopped to try another site. However ive been using it again this last month but its been burning my battery out. Had to uninstall it, its that bad. i couldn't understand why i was charging my phone like 4 times a day. Absolute joke!",0
If app did not stop my music automatically It will be the best,1
"Seriously. I am connected, why is my Spotify still in a so-called offline mode? And why cant i log the f in? This inspires my inner serial killer",0
I have been using Spotify from past two years and it was working so good..but I don't know what happened.. I'm trying to buy a premium pack with my sim card but it's not working.. please fix this..I really need Spotify,0
"I love that I can get whatever music I want, and listen to it whenever I want.",1
"FIX SPOTIFY, I have explicit content on, yet it won't let me play the songs, FIX THIS PLEASE.",0
A basic feature like editing your own playlist has been made premium for some reason. And what happened to 30 mins of uninterrupted listening?,0
I hated the ads but i love spotify because theres so many different song and it adds extra bass to the song 8/10,1
The UI malfunctioning in dark mode.,0
On my galaxy s22 this app is unreliable at best. Podcasts drop off or the app crashes and I can't stop the track and Spotify doesn't remember were I was inside of the podcast. It's not usable.,0
This is a good music service,1
Throughout the years more and more things are taken away from free Spotify and made premium only. What a greedy app.,0
The app is great but that doesn't mean it doesn't have problems so one prob that I have is when I start shuffle playing my liked music it plays music I've never heard of before so if you could fix that I might change my mind,1
I LOVED Spotify until I wasn't allowed to play my playlistðŸ˜¡,0
"really good music app with a few audio books like Solitaire by Alice Oseman, but lately it has been glitching to the point that I have to install it, log in, use it, and delete it multiple times! when it glitches, it plays but doesn't let me go to where I wanna go to in the audio book",0
Premium isn't worth it but if you don't buy it you get spammed with ads constantly. Most albums are missing at least 3 songs. Overall just feels like the app is mad at me for using it. Garbage.,0
Nice app! Wonderful music mixes!,1
I can't pic my own song now I have to shuffle them to listen to music and sometimes it will switch to recommended music and just stop playing my playlist it's weird I don't like the new update I should be able to choose my songs,0
"Ek is steering the company into an iceberg and it shows. Audio quality is enough for podcasts, not music -- for the same price, Tidal is a whole new league, even cassettes are better than Spotify. That aside, the UI is pathetically outdated. Ek wants to turn the company into a content producer...by hiring untalented loudmouths - way to betray the people that built the company, buddy! Dump this sinking ship, spend your money and time on something, anything worthwhile.",0
Spotify has an amazing way of noting music you love and creating a playlist for you that at your best and worst mood they are with you. Keep up the good work SPOT. Thank you.,1
Best App Ever ,1
THE AD SAY U WILL NOT GET ANY ADVERTISEMENT UNTIL 30 MIN BUT I GET AFTER EVERY 3 MINUTES I AM DELETING THE APP ðŸ’©,0
"PLEASE FIX THIS BROKEN APP. Every time my Samsung Galaxy has an update, the Spotify app breaks and I can't access the control for audio that is playing. It just plays, without control, until I cost the app.",0
So far so good,1
Spotify is not up to date. No control bar to control your music. Very disappointing,0
"Excellent app, Happy that I can hear my local Konkani songs unlimited.",1
I have a problem at sertain times it won't show the bar at the bottom when I play music and I can't change the song or restart the song the only way I can get rid of it is if I restart my phone please help me.,0
10/10 its just a tad bit difficult skipping songs on iphone.,0
I like how Spotify has so much variety as I get bored really easily I like this app.,1
"App stops while playing Spotify-made playlists for no reason. Usually middle of a song. If on shuffle it then restarts the shuffle from when you press play again. I don't want the same songs I just listened to. Meanwhile, a new ""feature"" of not showing a now-playing bar in-app! Bring it back, it's important!",0
Amazing app........Best app I have ever used ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š I recommend you are on the perfect platform if your searching for songs app..There is every song on this app Just amazing. Thank you spotify,1
"Nice and thoughtful, I'd however prefer if it didn't mix secular music into gospel tracks, when customizing a playlist.",1
The app is glitching a lot.. It is stopping the song suddenly and going blank. Please look into it,0
"The app works great, but there's 2 things I dislike about it, 1. Is the songs don't go in order of how they are listed, and 2 is how a song that's not even on my Playlist plays",0
Sometimes harder to control on the cellphone app. PC app is much easier.,0
"This is the best app for music lovers and this app contains kpop songs, pop, raps and many more. Must download",1
I live Spotify but the app is broken! Pretty bad interaction with other apps like Instagram and sometimes even whatsapp. Recently my app would just lose the play/pause forward bar and the currently playing song screen. So there would be no way to stop music without killing the app. The song also keeps freezing (even if it's downloaded) while in car and it is absolutely frustrating,0
"Couldn't live without my Spotify, use it most day's and it's well worth the money.",1
Spotify is one of the best platforms,1
This aapnis very nice I really love it. Listening to songs on it for atleat 3-4hrs a day. Plus I have premium membership. I just had one question... Is the canvas mode not available in India??,1
I don't know why I can't just select a song and listen or restart a playlist it's really annoying I mean I have Spotify on Xbox and I can pick whatever song I want to play whenever without it forcing me to listen to there garbage suggestions,0
Very nice,1
"It is good other than the fact that it adds songs to MY playlists, when I don't want them. Please fix, also ads were horrid.",1
"Way too many ads but good music, maybe put like 2-3 songs between every 5 songs instead of 10 songs between 5 songs?",0
cant listen to downloaded songs offline without update,0
Keeps going to sleep while listening,0
Works good. Good music,1
"Very unhappy, each time I time to play a song it would not work, or kept stopping",0
This app has ever song that you are looking for and it has a lot of podcasts but there are ads but they are not back to back you can listen to some music and the n you will get an ad,0
I love Spotify! The format is easy to read and understand. Not confusing like the competition. Also plays in the background while doing other task. Get it!,1
"This app has veen good for awhile now I just love that I can pay through other online paying application as long as it's available, however the vpn for this I'mstill struggling since thereare songs that aren't playable in other countries.",0
"Okay so i like the app and all, good quality and all songs you could wish for but the only problem that annoys me A LOT is the fact that you can't listen to a playlist in the order the playlist is created and you can't pick the song you want to listen to when in a playlist instead you have to search for it, this is only a problem with the free version which is just annoying cause id rather listen to my songs on other apps then so i can actually listen to what i want. Please fix this. Thank you.",0
This app is good for hearing BTS songs ðŸ˜‚,1
"Playlists don't function properly. Even when I download an episode, it won't play without a strong internet connection. Very resource heavy for bandwidth. UI is mediocre at best. If they didn't own Rogan, I wouldn't use them.",0
"Never had an app that literally ignores my imput... garbage. I search a song I want to listen to, listen to the ad then guess what... It plays sum bs not even related to the artist or song I want to hear. Okay no big deal I'll just skip it then... NOPE ANOTHER IRRELEVANT song I didn't ask for until I have no skips left and it never attempted to play the song or artist I wanted. Again... garbage",0
Too much ads are there even when Spotify showed 30min of ad free music I've seen ads.,0
I would say it is amazing but the adverts are not for me and it I was yo play something it would take me to a way different song which I dont really like but other than that the app it very good and better than sound cloud,1
"Perfect, just perfect",1
Features don't work. Doesn't allow me to like songs and crashes when I try to open the menu,0
Love the Music & it's so clear! Music to sooth the savage beast!!,1
The free accounts are ok. I get the ads but I really dont think it is great that you cannot choose what song you want to play with a free account. It is a good music streaming service though and I will recommend but they need to work on some of the free account features.,1
"No shuffle all, and massively wasteful with my data. Maybe Spotify doesn't bother playing downloaded music locally.",0
"Great app!! But could you please provide the song listen hits as an option?! ALSO, sort our liked list based on how many times we have listened to a song and give them our listen hits too?! Thanks!!",1
Need to stop play button,0
"I absolutely love Spotify but just recently I've been experiencing a reccuring issue, otherwise my score would be 5.",0
I rated spotify 4 stars because when you like the songs that you liked you need wifiðŸ™ and sometimes wifi is kinda slow in our house,0
Best music app,1
I can't skip any songs properly. From today. It is showing that you can skip only 6 songs in per hour. Please solve the the proBlem,0
Why don't the lyrics work. I pick a song saying it has lyrics but can't get them to come up. Swiping from the bottom of the screen does nothing and most of the time ends up switching to the previous or next song.,0
"I'm paying for the premium, but lately, a normal file player would have been better. It breaks music, without hitting any buttons, then I need to force stop and restart, it won't play on my computer and certain podcasts, eventhough it did two days ago. A serious bug fix needed!!!",0
There are way to many adds for example i listen to one song and then i get two adds that are each 30 seconds which is 1 minute and you get adds every 2 songs,0
Too much advertise,0
"Its terrible, i suggest you use youtube music, at first i thought it was great but once you have it for a while it gets annoying. Also the last few updates have been horrible. I think that not being able to chose what song you want to listen to is very annoying, you end up having to skip most of the songs. It also adds things to your playlists. I have a wide variety of music and most of the songs they add i personal hate. I love YouTube music so much more and none of these problems are there.",0
"This app is just superb... there is only one suggestion, when I opened this app it automatically started playing songs which I've heard last time... other than this... everything is good. I really loved that this app contains podcast... Thank you Spotify.",1
I like the app because it is good for listening to music but there is just kn one issue I have I keeps signing me out of my account randomly and it is quite hard to get back into it when does this. Can you please fix that one issue.,0
"Senior First timer! I can't afford premium rate...so I need to be more patient with the adds. I'm still learning how to use it and it's good , that in a way I can listen my favorite music and artists .It would be nice to include special rates to seniors ðŸ™‚. Thanks and Blessings ! Be Safe! Be nice!â¤ Granny ðŸ‘µ 67",1
It a very great for hearing music,1
"Spotify mobile is a good way to stream music, although it does get annoying to have advertisments every 2 songs, they aren't too long and usually aren't terrible. But for the love of all that is holy you gotta add the ability to stop certain ads from playing, ive been genuinely turned off from listening to Spotify because of that garbage Uber eats ad that plays every break, it doesn't make much sense to force tons of ads every 2 songs, and to give the user almost 0 control over what plays.",0
Easily best music spot to have on my phone.,1
Yall are amazing just wish all the premium services can be free just for 17 days,1
It is a wonderful app. It has all. Kind of songs and can be operated on both PC and mobiles.,1
Very good thank you Spotify,1
Luv it ,1
"Used it for years but it's gotten so glitchy recently. And with the controversy, honestly just go back to pirating",0
Video podcasts don't work while one wireless earphones.,0
"I like the app, but I just wish you didn't have to pay for premium just to listen off-line. I'm tired of using my data, and I've been trying to use other apps that I can download and listen off-line but I have a new phone so I can't download them. It'd be better if they didn't have people pay, and only 6 skips. It's a good app the music plays just fine.",1
"The app logged me out of my account, I've had to update my password and now the app stays on a screen with the logo and won't open at all. I have uninstalled and downloaded again and updated and it won't open.",0
"This app used to be fine, but now I can't even play music from my Playlist because all it does is show me previews of music I already have.",0
"They pay artists next to nothing, and exploit their users for market data. Use another app for music, like Tidal.",0
it was good until the shuffle button was replaced with a pause button with the option to shuffle the playlist. Now I have to find songs instead of just pressing the shuffle button,1
"FIX THE ISSUES EVERYONE IS COMPLAINING ABOUT! Stops playing randomly, the player doesn't even come up to switch songs, keeps playing when disconnected from speaker and everything else everyone has said. We pay a monthly subscription for you to make it annoying to use!",0
App is insanely clunky. Keep crashing on podcasts. Pauses for no reason. Just all around annoying to use.,0
I've had Spotify for 5 years or so and I'm a ride or die. I even had it downloaded on my iPhone to replace Apple Music because duh.,0
Never could update card details so can't play music in my van no Internet is Al l I get but that is Spotify s fault hence poor review,0
Terrible app. Constant bugs and issues. Works for two days and then crashes. You have uninstall and then reinstall. I've been a subscriber for over 8 years. No longer. Its not worth the money.,0
Love it but I wish it was unlimited skips all the time but it's a good app,1
More ads on Spotify,0
It sometimes lags my phone severely. Sometimes it just straight up refuses to play the next song in my playlist until I open my phone and tell it to keep going.,0
The app was working well until the past couple of weeks. It always shows I'm offline even if I'm not and now my login won't come through (using app) even if my password works via web. It is very frustrating.,0
"Worst app ever. They give songs between ads, I mean how can they even put songs between the ads , it just ruins the joyful exprience of listening to the ads. If they remove the songs I will definitely give them 5 stars.",0
This app doesn't have half of the songs specially remixes. And there is no option to suggest a song to add in Spotify.,0
Love it I just don't like mobile because you can't play songs it just gives you a preview otherwise I would say it's good.,1
"Best invention ever and if you are not on Spotify, I don't know what you are doing with your life.",1
"Features can be buggy / not robust. Collaborative list can't add to, arduous navigation to blend (search, create new, then send SMS), new likes don't appear added at times when clicking icon.",0
Ads are way too loud + annoying. Don't even try and ask me to join premium I'm broke.,0
Selection of song is very easy Enjoying,1
Very good app,1
"So much to receive with this app. Brings back so many memories ""even If I forgotten all about it the song remembers when""",1
"I like how it works but some of us want to pick instrumental only or voice only. I'm still figuring out to accomplish this on this app. Also I prefer to not here some instruments, ie piano, accordion, or nationality blends. I have now signed up for it, so as I become expert on its use which means I will continue to streamline the app to my needs!!",1
It's awesome it just sucks that u have to pay for it,1
This app sucks. It constanly stops playing. It also leans to live music versus originals. I see the idea but I hate the experience. I recommend Stucher for podcasts.,0
"It's a good App, now I can listen to music without having Internet, thank to premium",1
Yall lost two of my accounts and won't let me sign in to either of them because they don't exist because I didn't use it for 2 days? 2 DAYS AND MY ACCOUNT IS LOST. I spent 2 hours making Playlist that I liked and you ruined it for me because yall can't keep your accounts straight. On top of that the ads are so annoying and you only get 30 minute without them which is like no time compared to the time songs take. This whole thing annoys me and I literally hate it now. GET my account back.,0
So I have had enough of paying premium Spotify when the past 2/3 months everytime I play Spotify and then lock my phone it stops working have been through all my setting. Have been hoping that the updates that I do help but nope. Getting real sick of it,0
"Need to make new version work with the spotify app on pioneer radio, 8.7 worked and now it won't",0
"Gr8 is all i have to say, theres some ads but that's fine tbh",0
All I gotta say is Spotify is frustrating asf to use.,0
"It's getting better each update!! Now even i can sort my playlist alphabetically without literally move the song one by one. Thank you, Spotify!",0
My fave streaming app! The biggest selection of music !!,1
It is a very nice app. I personally liked it and even in offline it is working also. Very cool app.,1
I love everything about Spotify except one thing and that is song's quality!!,1
Best App for music!,1
"Spotify is so easy to use, and has a wide variety of choice whether you want music, podcasts etc. Would highly recommend to anyone xx",1
"It does have all the songs I'm looking for, but I hate how it will add more song into my Playlist and I can't slip it because I can't make money for premium.",0
"Paying for premium, but constantly drops connection and app crashes",0
Its my favorite app to listen to my favorite Latino songs I also love the premium Duo I think its a big save,1
Great but it would be best if you can add the play next option and you can let all songs play continuously not that I have to change it myself all the time am done with a song,0
"Latest update I cannot pause, fast forward a song or close the app. Review just went from 5 stars to 1 star.",0
Spotify has ease of use and millions of songs to choose from and if you choose to get premium say goodbye to ads and hello to Playlists really there is no way to go wrong with this app,1
I put on Whitney Houston and Spotify made me the best play list I ever heard. I listened to it over and over!!!!,1
Love my morning gospel playlists on my way to and from work,1
Nice app for listening music . Most of the songs are available. User friendly interface.but the adds are annoying you can buy premium so that you do not face ads.BTS ARMY ðŸ’—,0
"It's a great app!but can you please add,, 03 by SHMEKERA"" please it's my favorite song.",1
Not happy with the music stoping every time and not paying in the background have changed the settings so that it can not pleased,0
I'm new to Spotify and still learning. I'm sure that once l become a seasoned user I'll be in a better position to fairly judge the merits of the service.,1
lately whenever Im listening to a playlist on my phone the whole app will reload and the music will stop playing On my TV too the ads cut through the music before its done playing and its become very annoying I love Spotify but I want to enjoy my day without these types of interruptions Thank you,1
too bad cant play songs bad update,0
"Let people exclude songs, playlists from their taste profile so recommendation doesn't become full of sleeping music",0
This is a excellent App I seen in my life,1
"Edit: still not fixed for weeks already.. If you are into bugs and apps that barely work then Spotify is the right choice for you! Queue system is broken as soon as I add a song, the mini playbar disappears out of nowhere and plays the music in the background and stays like that until the app gets terminated.",0
"I love love the app , the only place I listen to my music onall the time .listen to my music as soon as I open my eyes , until I go to bed .",1
Everything is good but if I play my or any other playlist it plays any different playlist expect that everything is fine ,1
App not working. Play bar is not there and music stops when my phone is sat on the table,0
"The app keeps crashing, whenever I play music",0
Annoying nag for extra unnecessary Bluetooth permissions every time you open the app. The answer is no. And no means NO. Respect that and stop asking.,0
"This will stay 5 stars and I will stay with Spotify as long as the don't cower to the left and kick Joe Rogan off. Keep your testicles, Spotify.",1
"I'd like to be able to remove a song from a Playlist that is currently playing without having to scroll through hundreds of songs, find it, and then remove it.",1
It is so nice to listen to my music on Spotify it's the best app you ever created.,1
"I like spotify, you can look for any genre and artist or Playlist but what I hate is that I can't turn off shuffle mode which is very annoying. please do something about that, I searched for a shuffle button in the apo but could find it, on Google it says that the shuffle button is near the ""now playing"" bar but I can't seem to find it :(",0
Poor app it's not working,0
"Bugs everywhere after 29 March 2022 update. Can't see the playing song screen, can't control next/prev song with bluetooth (which ran perfectly fine before) have to force close consistently.",0
"Probably the best music app ever made, its only downside is that it doesn't have that much unreleased music",1
"Hello, why spotify alwasy automatic playing while i am open the apps? I was find setting to turn off ,but there is not an option for that. I am using samsung galaxy S21 and also S22 in the same case. Please fix it or just garbage for a while if not fix!",0
Horrible. Not Worth the Price. It used to be BEST. They now got someone developing it Completely Wong! It just hurts the users and that sucks for premium subscribers like me. Middle Finger if you will. I'm done paying for errors! It just constantly stops.. They owe me and you.. they owe us all..,0
The UI is worsening with each update. The app feels slow. The semi-transparent titlebar at the bottom of the screen looks horrible. The artist image in artist pages often cut out the face of the artist for older artists. It doesn't even fetch the actual image sometimes - just loads a random album cover instead of it (although works in the desktop version).,0
The app is great but beware of the ads every like 3 songs there are multiple ads one time I had there be at least 5-6 adds in between songs. But other than that the app is amazing,1
Excellent music and songs provider,1
I love Joe Rogan podcast and installed spotify because of his podcast.Now my entire music tracks I love and other podcasts is on Spotify....Hail JRE,1
"This is by far one of the best apps. The ui is sleek, suggestions work great , my family has no problem with paying the relatively small cost of the family premium membership (which covers our 4 accounts), great music selection, I've started listening to some podcasts. And it is just overall a solid app. The only problem I have with it would be how much space its takes up, but with how much I use it that's worth it",1
More ads than Hulu and YouTube combined. Going back to the pirates. â˜ ï¸,0
Where do I start well Spotify was the last musical platform that I added to my music app ecosystem I already have YouTube music and SoundCloud and Spotify has been a welcome addition I love the fact that I have the ability to search for singles remixes and albums from all three what I enjoy doing is opening Spotify and SoundCloud in split screen view and being able to blend and mix between the twoðŸŽ›ï¸,1
Never have been annoyed in my entire life than while using this application,1
"Just got the s22 ultra, and after opening the app, it just shows the logo and doesn't do anything else. I haven't even logged in to my account",0
"Locked me out of my account. It got my email wrong, despite putting it correctly the first timeand changed it to one that didn't exist. Then it said my password was wrong as well. So now my accounts and playlists that I have been building over a year are gone.",0
Amazing but if the premium prices where cheaper it would be better.,0
"If I want to play a specific song, it plays the whole playlist, which i find extremely annoying and it only let's me skip six songs an hour, so I'm stuck with the same playlistof songs even though i wanted tailored songs",0
"Please allow people to change theme, I personally don't like apps with black design.",1
"I love it. My music doesn't get put on hold for any ads, it's the best app ever. No regrets.",1
likeee,1
The app has become really glitchy following recent updates. Playback continually drops out despite strong network signal. Playback freezes and minicontrols etc are inconsistent. Often the mini control reflects a different Playlist for example or shows nothing playing while a.playback is in progress. Used to be an easy five star but not getting value for money at the moment.,0
All good....But stop bullshitting with the free thing u guys mislead us Spotify users,0
Great collection of music!,1
So buggy. This time its turning off after a few minutes of me turning my phone off. Each time there's an update something new goes wrong.,0
"It's a great app for listening music, I have playlists I've made as profile Cheetah345 with probably thousands of songs. I have few complaints other than the fact that premium is just expensive enough that as a teenager with not much income I can't afford to spend that much. Unfortunately you are pushing a political agenda with ads that I am sick of. Every time I listen anymore every single ad is for pro gay junk. I don't want ads for that. It's gotten so bad I can't even use this app anymore",1
I Give It a five star because you can listen do any music you like and it has the best taste,1
It's a really frustrating that I cannot play the song i want it's playing another song not everyone can buy the premium and I'm really hatijg this update like seriously? I am going to uninstall this app if the problem dosen't fix The team should check the problem of millions,0
I had very well experience with this application but as being Nepali it is very hard to buy simple subscription of this app because in my country everyone don't have master or visa card to do international transition. I wish the team will come with some solutions as fastest as can be................,0
It's a great app and probably my favourite music app but I hate the fact we can't remove songs from our recently played or tube our recommendation because someone listened to songs that I find bad and then my recommendation is filled with them. Pls solve this issue,0
"I've been a premium subscriber since 2020 and the app was amazing until the last update. What happened to the ""preview song"" feature?? It used to be so convenient, clicking the side of the song that I've searched to hear a bit out of it, now I need to guess if the piece that I want to add to my playlist is the one I wanted or go to YouTube to be sure, please bring it back",0
The app was working fine until a couple of weeks ago. I can play any songs and it says I have no playlists. The app for my PC works fine and I downloaded it on my tablet and it works fine. It somehow just isn't cooperating with my phone.,0
"Easy and instant to use, fantastic searches.",1
"After every single song an advertisement, so annoying ðŸ˜–",0
I always listen tp my favorite songs,1
I really love this app. It has a wide selection of music and podcasts to choose from. I also like that the payment plans for premium are varied and one can comfortably choose a plan that works for them.,1
friend activity tab and profile tab instead of the premium tab on android/ios and CHANGE THE LAYOUT OF THE PLAY SKIP LIKE AND WHATEVER BUTTONS THEY LOOK HORRIBLE,0
"Used to love app but since last update, triple dot on right corner of song while searching gets removed,app doesn't work well if song stops then resume,Lyrics translation option's gone. Overall experience is getting worst with each passing day.",0
It's great but it's a shame you can't download your music selected .,0
App frequently crashes and loses control on my z flip 3.,0
"Please fix your app! Long time subscriber and recently my music skips and now playing just disappears on my S21 Ultra. If there was a obscure feature not working, that would be one thing, in this case it is the core functionality not working. I am very disappointed. Contemplating subscribing to a different service.",0
"I love this app I can hear to bts songsðŸŽ§ðŸŽµ, hurray! And this is jst awesome for all, but especially for armys ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ¥°â¤",1
"Huge connectivity issues with Samsung S22 ultra , also it does not show the music bar.",0
Let me listen to my own damn songs not some suggested songs.,0
Great as all my old song ðŸ’“ and the up dates are great ðŸ’ž,1
Suddenly missing the option to shuffle my liked songs by genre and customer service was horrible didn't have a clue i just started back with Spotify and already disappointed,0
"Crashes constantly, related artists questionable, terrible UI. Least ethical company out of the bunch. Later.",0
"I like the large variety of music! And I love how you can create endless playlists! I do wish you could organize your playlists on the mobile app. Also, clean versions would make family rides a whole lot easier! I have to switch to YouTube if I want to play a clean song, which is an inconvenience because I don't pay premium for YT. It's not cheap, I wish it was a little less for premium. It does tend to bug every few months, and stops playing 98% of all my songs after 9 seconds.",0
It's great! There are a lot of different choices for music and podcasts.,1
The only thing I don't like is adsðŸ˜£,0
"Downloaded this for podcasts - what a disappointing, frustrating experience. Far worse than any podcasting app i've used. Update - April 2022 - they seem to have done away with the ability to pause, skip forward, skip back etc. So i can start playing a given podcast, and i can select a different podcast, but that is about it. If i want to ""pause"" an episode, i have to quit the app entirely. This is incomprehensible. If Rogan ever leaves, i will delete this app, with gratitude.",0
We love our Spotify!,1
Too Good App for listening music ðŸŽ¼ðŸ”¥,1
"Music removed. App keeps asking to connect Bluetooth and no option to turn off the message. Button layout changed, looks unfriendly and ugly.",0
App is crashing itself when i play songs do something about it fast,0
Almost tempted to return to radio or other players due to not being able to play albums in order just cos you're not premium. Functionality is curtailed to what they want you to do and not user experience. Ads also reliant on gambling etc,0
"When the app works, it's fantastic! For over two months I have only been able to listen to the app for a few hours before it will no longer pause, skip, show the correct information for what is playing, etc. I usually have to force stop the app and open it again or have to restart my phone completely. I'm a monthly subscriber and have been for over two years. I don't understand why this app can be so great one day then be complete trash for months after an update.",0
Wonderful easy to use,1
"I've had Spotify paid subscription for years and love the app, but ever since the last update it randomly stops showing the song that is playing as well as pause stop next etc and the only way to see it again is to reboot my device. Could you please look and fix this?",0
An exceptional experience indeed. Just a subscription away from music heaven and full access.,0
There are buggs when you want to use your other device az a remote the track wont always skip,0
The music and stations and radios are always so cooperative they work so good and I appreciate everything that they do music here just it hits different and I love it that is why I am here giving it a five star I highly recommend this app it's plays music and podcasts and so many different genres of music and stuff and it's amazing and I highly recommend it,1
I like Spotify but I don't like that when you make you're playlist it's doesn't let you play the song you want and before you could I want it how it was before ngl it was better,0
I really love the wide variety of music the app has. I can jam to my favorites and new favorites anytime,1
"I know this is a business thing but please make us choose the song we want to listen to, and i can't find the song i need in a readable format, i was enjoying the thing first and then i found out that i can't choose the song any more, this will cause the app to be hated and will attract less people to it.",0
"I love listening all of my favorite songs, old and new ðŸ¤˜ðŸ˜Š",1
A very interesting app packed with cool choice of music. But to those in Africa it is more data consuming,1
The best music app ever! Our whole family has individual accounts,1
I like it but the new update is trash and is makes me want to get rid of it please fix it,0
"1st class, brilliant songs and artists at a touch of a button.",1
"I really enjoy Spotify. In the past I have lost my downloaded songs on other devices , but have kept this account across multie phones so don't have to keep starting again. Plus I listen to my favourite podcasts too!",0
It is a good app but for me it cuts off randomly and says Spotify isn't working right now,0
If not for the amount if humongous ads for premium the app is best for itself,0
I am updating my review. Spotify is awesome. No problems whatsoever! I play monthly for the extra service. That includes my 3 boys and myself. Soo worthh it!,1
Bekar hei yar mat karo download,1
"Spotify is bs. Pandora is better because atleast doesn't have a limit on FREE. Your ads were on a loop for a while. If you think I'm gonna pay with money I don't got and try a trap me with loops of ads.... then not only is this a shifty app, it's getting reported everyday. Don't like it, don't con people.",0
Good app for music fanatics. Good content well organized layout. Graphics are great. Loving it so far. ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾,1
Its a great app,1
It was fine before update but after the update I can't pick the songs I want to play on the playlist I made to listen to Please fix it!!,0
"All that needs to be said, unable to launch. Tried everything. Had to allow all permissions and go into recovery mode and ""Mount System"" and then clear cache and ""optimize apps"" to get the app to run again this time. Seriously Spotify, this needs to be fixed. I wouldn't be surprised if these issues and or constant problems cause a mass exodus of members from your service.",0
I have premium but its easy and has all the music I love,1
"Samsung users beware. Switched from Amazon Unlimited because my wife (iPhone 13 user had Spotofy and really liked it). App works fine on her phone and on our Roku at home. Is a complete nightmare on my A71. Constantly pausing and has no player interface 80% of the time. So you have to force stop to pause, skip, etc. Spent a few hours with Spotify techs online. The end result being that they are aware of the problem. You shouldn't be taking on new customers without notifying them!!",0
"Simple. Everytime I select a song for ANYTHING, it selects a different song. Not ok, my Spotify on my PC does way better than this.",0
The best music streaming platform at an affordable price,1
Omg is so good I love Spotify #kl perfect,1
been using spotify for 5+ years and they have never let me down. premium is amazing and i'm always discovering a new song/ artist.,1
Like the music but it is a pain that spotify auto connects every time I get in the car or on the bike. Even if I was listening to a podcast or some other music streaming service. Probably delete it before the week is out unless I find out how to stop it.,0
Great experience . Only thing that would make me rate this a five star is to improve the lack of options there are for podcast listeners. I could only imagine a no ad podcast that would be supported by Spotifys monthly membership. Creators receive a more steady income & we the listeners don't have to hear the same ad read on 4 different podcasts. Love you Spotify @Jamonconqueso on IG .,0
"My Spotify mobile app is not connecting to the internet, same issue is there for my friend. Please look into this.",0
Spotify needs to chill with the premium not everyone can afford premium just chill with the premium simple,0
SuperðŸ‘ but you have to improveðŸ˜‡,0
likeee,1
Very easy to use and wide selection of artists,1
It is better but the spotify ads does not like good i recommend you to stop the spotify ads,0
I can't skip songs nor can I pause them. My husband and I have been having this issue for a few days and I'm not due for an update. Please fix as soon as possible.,0
"Bugs galore. When a song is playing, there isn't the little card on the bottom that lets you access previous, play pause, next song or any controls anymore",0
Redoing the play button skip n rewind leaving them unorganized was dumb af. That alone is gonna make me unsubscribe. Why mess with a good thing smfh,0
"I really enjoyed Spotify for a long time, but their support is terrible. Recently my liked songs keep disappearing and i spoke to 4 representatives. the first was friendly but unhelpful. The next three were rude or just not responsive and they also were not helpful. What is the point of paying so much money for aomething that doesn't even work anymore?",0
Your only job is to play podcasts. I wish I could give zero stars,0
"I used to love this app, but the since the latest update spotify connect won't work I can still cast through chromecast but the audio quality isn't as good. A large part of why I pay for premium is for the high quality audio through my amp. If this doesn't get fixed soon I am seriously considering cancelling my subscription and going back to being a free user even if it means I have to listen to ads.",0
"Revert to an older version or fix your app!!! It is insane that your app has been broken for months. I've read articles how the now playing functions disappear so I know it's not just me. This should be something that could be fixed in a day once you were aware of the issue, and if you can't fix it, then revert to the last working version until you have the problem solved. It is beyond comprehension that I have to force close the app 5 times a day because I can't rewind or pause what's playing.",0
It's downhill from here. Looks like the app glitches way too much. If this keeps up I'll be switching services for sure,0
Love it....they have an amazing amount of songs at your fingertips. And gemerally it plays without trouble but Giving them 4 stars because at least once a week it won't play when I connect it to my car even if the Playlist is downloaded to my phone. Does not matter what song I choose in tbe list it will not play. I have to choose a different Playlist and go back to original once the new one plays then no trouble,1
Decent app. Playlist with thousands of songs are repetative and predictable with premium/paid thus is the main complaint,0
"Spotify is my go to music streaming platform. It's very easy to create playlists. Only two requests I have of Spotify on next update. Do the Youtube thing where you can add a song to multiple playlists at once. And, make Russian Doll playlists. As in, so you can make an ultimate playlist. Anytime I add a song to these playlists, it automatically adds to this other overarching playlist. That would simplify things a lot so I'm not constantly having to manage all my different playlists.",1
Impossible to listen to offline playlists unless started on wifi.,0
I .ove playing my Playlist and other music on Spotify.,1
"The best algorithm for music finding that there is and the only reason I'm still paying for premium. Otherwise the app takes ages to load My downloaded songs sometimes undownload themselves Other times my playlists don't load even though they are downloaded and thus can happen online and offline All this is happening on a Samsung s21, Hauwei P30 Pro, Macbook Pro",0
The app has been buggy the past couple of days the play bar just doesnt show up,0
Love Spotify has all the songs I search for,1
"Why am I getting ads when all its playing is suggested songs,then 3 ads? 2 30 seconds and a 10 second one. I'm currently listening to my liked songs and I've been listening for nearly an hour and have only heard the song that wasn't finished playing from last time and one after,the rest has been suggested songs.",0
Good,1
Good music and easy to use,1
"The app is rlly good, the thing is that every time a song ends 2 30s ads come up, and another thing is when I play my playlist, it plays a random song that isn't even on my playlist, please fix that, I just wanna listen to songs in my playlist, not random songs",0
"Updates with spotify are dangerous find a working version and dont update. Now the clip art doesnt work right in all liked songs AND when I go into an artist and then my liked songs within that artist and hit shuffle I now get random unrelated artists instead of shuffling the liked songs within that artist which is how it has always worked in the past! This is a failure of leadership, please do not blame the lowest employees/developers. Those who higher the failing managers need to be replaced.",0
Nice app,1
is great best app ever it just has a little bit of glitches but that's expected when you listen to it more than 5 hours a day,0
I like this app because of bts songs is there...,1
I love Spotify. I can find anytjing I want to liaten to. They have any genre I want or if I want a podcast they have it!,0
"I really hate how it adds extra songs to your playlists. I have to constantly go through and take them all off. I make my playlists how I like them and don't need your input. Also, the ads are far too loud. Why are that so much louder than the music? I have my music quite quiet when using headphones but the ads pop up and I have to take my headphones off because it hurts my ears.",0
"it won't let me past the opening screen with the logo I tried re Installing, clear data/cache, force stop , restarting device nothing seems to work plus I don't get canvas feature so I'm gonna cancel premium",0
"The best, I get to listen to my favorite songs",1
"Doesn't even work. I pay for this and it keep saying ""playback failed"" when trying to listen to a podcast. Where is the pause button? I can never find it.",0
Has been super glitchy and slow in the last month. Considering cancelling my subscription for pandora,0
Botched everything up recently. Please make it better or back to how it was.,0
Love music I love this sporting app good to listen ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ‘Œ ..and one thing I don't like there is so many ads...,1
They have all the music I like!!,1
"Good but annoying. How does an app with playlists give 7 ads in a row and still be called a music app? I legit stoped and move to SoundCloud and YT Music. And wth is ""can't skip for 1hr"" what is this? TinderðŸ˜‚? ""Ran outta right swipes wait 6hrs""",0
I unsubscribe to your service and removed but I am still being charged please reverse the transaction,0
Shuffles songs instead of letting me pick one,0
It doesn't even play the song you want to listen seriously,0
Easy stable interface. Lots of artists.,1
"ever since the update its terribly slow. ive had premium for years and im now thinking about canceling it. its been like this for about 2 months. i got tge trial for youtube music premium and thats a lot better. i cant even use spotify, it takes like 5 minutes to load then like a min for every playlist i click on and its even worse on offline mode.",0
"Well, it continously says offline and to get online to listen to anything. I am online....ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ðŸ˜’",0
I can't login in this app.Please fix it soon.,0
Bring back being able to preview a song when adding to a playlist. I have no idea why yall would remove this feature in the first place. Made adding songs more convenient and not annoying as it is right now.,0
The music stops playing randomly in the update. I'll change it if it gets fixed.,0
The app is amazing. It is great for listening to music. 5 of 5 stars for my review.,1
Old songs are not yet available,0
Unable to pause or stop in app. Playback pauses for no apparent reason. Phone must be restarted in order to stop app.,0
"Have been having many problems since April, still often doesn't even manage to play a song when I open the app and press a song, literally the most basic function you could imagine from a music app. Fix your app!!!!!",0
So sweet,1
I am having some issue with Spotify in my phone. It opens a lot slower than other apps in my phone. I also compared it with other phones and only in my phone there is this slowness. I researched and tried everything I could but it did not solve the issue. Other than that it is a pretty good app.,0
Spotify randomly deleted Spotify blend last month.,0
Love it awesome Playlist and student plan is for amazing for 4.99 of months,1
It's wonderful that I can listen to music I like with my playlist and put it on loop too,1
"Canâ€™t preview songs when adding to playlist When I want to add songs to my playlists and click on add songs I can't play the songs it suggests to me, I only have the option to add songs. I can't listen to a song before adding it to my playlist. ""like listening to see if you would like a song or not before adding it to a playlist.""",0
Free version; went from same ad over and over to multiples ads after almost every song. I'll just listen to the radio,0
Absolutely love Spotify â¤ï¸,1
"Loving it. Keep me going all day. Great app, music for all ages.",1
"Updates that others have doesn't seem to be applied to all... Like where are my lyrics, also downloaded music doesn't always play with no internet",0
"The last update really made a mess of ""car thing"" and mobile Bluetooth streaming in my car.",0
"It is a great music app, but I can't find some songs.",0
"I had Spotify for a long time then it started no longer worked so I switched to YouTube premium. Although I am writing this negative review now due to recent controversy, because they should not allow false information on their platform.",0
"Recently started randomly stopping songs, also the play controls do not appear in app unless I force close it and open it again. I wish there was an option to hide podcasts, I'm not interested and it clutters the UI for nothing.",0
To choose my like songs with the lyrics on the bottom of the screen is fantastic.,1
"NO INTERNET CONNECTION ISSUE I haven't been able to connect to my Spotify account for the past 1 week because it keeps telling me that there's no internet. Fix this pls else we switch to Audiomack, there are less issues there.",0
Clear music havent looked for a song they didnt have,0
Great sound quality and easy app to use,1
I hope there will be an upgrade in the equalizer. 5 band is good but I guess 10-band is better if there is no 31-band.,0
Update broke the app. Will stop playing music at random even when songs are downloaded and sometimes wont stop playing when app has been cleared.,0
This is an very good app to listen Your favourite songs i love it It have all the songs i need to listen other people think that this is bad but it is not bad it is smooth to use and to hear,1
"When I came here in Dubai, UAE, the rewind button is not working, I can't adjust the streaming line and I can only skip 6 times per hour. I can tolerate all the ads in the world but what is this. Seriously!! In order to get rid of these inconvenience I have to shell out 20 AED PM?? Spotify!! Can u really do something bout this.?? ðŸ˜«.",0
"Wish I could give 0 stars! Even if you download a podcast, if you dont have an internet connection you cant listen. What's the point of downloading? Re downloaded and works great now",1
The best app for music,1
"It is best for study , it is best music app, if I get chance I will give it millions of stars, but for now 5 star is best",1
"I am a premium user, and I can't access music downloaded and I have tried redownloading it but it is still not working.",0
"This app used to be good, they didn't used to have excessive ads, it was 1-2 ads every 5-6 songs, now its like 5-6 ads every 2 songs",0
"I have this app, why does it pick songs that I don't want? Like it was not in my playlist it's damn anoying, really hate it. Ugh!!!!",0
"Adding tracks on paid version It seems that Spotify feel that they can add tracks to my selection, eg album, despite me just uninstall and reinstall and paying 9.99 per month. Looks like I will be trying tidal. Very poor",0
Best place for music and podcasts!,1
"Local files are not showing anymore, since this new update released. Do you have any way to fix this?!?!?!?!",0
"It Could be 5 but bcuz of ads and you should also add karoake version of song with it, everyone agree??",1
Good morning When I first got hooked up with Spotify love it to be truthful about it l just got to have it all day and GOD knows l need it..l listen to the new young Christian gospel song amen.good stuff..,1
"I've been using Spotify for years. Only a few bugs here and there, but they're usually quick to update. I will say, lately, I've been having issues with the auto update. There's also this weird problem where the app will just start playing music even if NOTHING is open. It's strange and I'm not sure why it keeps happening, but it's not just me. Spotify, could you please try and fix this? You guys would be 5 star, but that bug has been getting annoying ðŸ˜“",0
Spotify podcast suck so much a**. The absolute only reason I use it is to occasionally listen to Rogan... unfortunately it barely works. Spotify should gtfo of podcast because they can't even make a reliable podcast player... POS.,0
Very buggy for the past few months Often doesn't show what is currently playing in the app which also prevents me from pausing or skipping to the next song. When this happens even force closing the app doesn't work. Quality has declined massively,0
Best app for music playlists!!!,1
Someone explain to me why there is no 'recently released' songs section on Artists profile?,0
It is best for music field,1
"Fix the app! Its been broken for long enough. It's practically unusable. Keeps crashing, controls don't display (including not displaying song details) only way to stop a song playing is close the app. (Or wait for it to crash)",0
Can't Spotify just give us the chance to hear a song again n again and count as stream!!!! please i wanna hear Jimin's ost without stopping ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,1
"Love the app, I have used it for years but recently the mini player within the has disappeared and no really way to see what's playing,pause or skip tracks and I'm also have the problem of having to close down all apps when disconnecting aux from car because music keeps playing on phone. Spotify is this a bug from recent update or ......?",0
Amazing app! Been using it for almost 2 and a half years. But lately the app has been faking the time for ex: the real time is 1:30 but the song says 0:00 not letting me restart the song very quickly like i used to. Hopefully you fix it soon but other than this its awesome,1
It's brilliant needs everything I got thanks â˜ºï¸,1
I'm gonna give 4 star's bc y'all don't deserve 5 star. So I'm gonna explain how is it first of all idk why is the music cracking also I can't even know how many times the music stops on is own so can you please make it right plz idc what it takes to make it right but plz make it right then I don't see any problem with this app so yea app is great I love it byee then ~,1
Amazing except I can only skip 3 times and it should tell me when I am going to get an add,1
much more fun Reasonable easy and cheaper,1
"Recently the app has been randomly losing the player. Can't close the app, can't stop what's playing. Argh! Been using the app for years and have loved it. This needs to be fixed - please! Update July 5, 2022 Seemed to have returned to normal until today - same issue. Am un-installing and re-installing.",1
Excellent variety of music!!,1
I like this app and I really wanted to give it 5 stars even tho the adds are just so INAPPROPRIATE but I just wanna delete it because of the new update It makes you listen to the popular part only in your likes and you have to make your own playlist and it's really sucks cuz when I finish listening to my fav songs it gives me other songs which I hate If I find another app I'll literally download it and delete Spotify,0
The app updated recently and now the app crashes when the play button is clicked. Please do check on this issue.,0
I love this damn app till the end of time.,1
"Hi, so when i play any songs and randomly a song pop-up a different song, so i was like WHAT THE HECC IS WRONG WITH SPOTIFY, so yea i gave you a bad review",0
"My very own favourite music on a loop without adverts, Heaven",1
I've been using spotify premium for a years. And suddenly can't register for premium account because over limit. Please fix it then i will change it to 5 stars,0
Amazing audio streaming app that everyone should have on their device. I'm a bit late to the party having just started getting into it recently. I hope that all video streaming services take note of the features Spotify has and work them into their own services. They also continue to innovate with more great ideas so keep up the great work!,1
Very good app. Sometimes I have to mess around and reset my phone or stop the app a few times because it can't play songs or whole playlists,0
"Such a wide ranging choice of music. Has taken Nokia's Mix Radio function from years ago and made it their own, but the algorithms at play are exceptionally clever in deciding what you want to listen to. Tidal and Qobuz quality is better for hi-fi, but for sheer choice and volume of music and podcasts, Spotify is the best.",1
Good app to use. Sone songs are unavailable. Its not possible to skip the adds...not everyone can afford subscription,0
Constant crashing and songs pausing for no reason after latest update. Often the app doesn't recognize a song is playing,0
It's just amazing. Better than apple music.,1
Very satisfying. I'm able to listen all the oldies,1
"Can't even start the app, I have to use spotify lite",0
Best app for music ever,1
When you select an artist Playlist it plays one song by the artist plays a commercial and then plays random songs you don't want to hear so you use all your skips,0
Absolutely amazing any song you search it will find. Love it so much,1
"Super glitchy and frustrating I ended up cancelling my subscription and deleting the app. It never works properly anymore and I can't use it most of the time. It constantly states that it's not connected to the internet even though it is. I've tried all the ""tips"" to fix it and it still doesn't work. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but now it won't even let me log in. This app is absolutely horrible.",0
The app stops playing when I lock my phone. Also it acts like I'm not playing something when I am so I doesn't let me change the song or podcast. It has been getting worse fix and I will give 5 stars,0
"I have been a subscriber family for a long time, 5 star no problems, how ever just recent, I have now don't have the lyrics and some songs don't play, please get it all sorted please",0
Because it keeps saying spotify can't play in the background and my music keeps pausing like please fix it or I'm not gonna use your app,0
Isse badhiya to youtube ha ,1
"Longtime Premium subscriber who loves the service for the most part, but the most recent app update is buggy and nearly unusable. Frequently stops playback, and playback controls often vanish, both within the app and in the system playback monitor. This update is a dumpster fire.",0
The layout is frustrating. I just want to see the things I want not the things that Spotify wants me to see. I only got the app to see Joe rogan and I get bombarded with a bunch of trash I never wanted to see,0
"I hate the ads, everything else is ðŸ‘",0
It's very good if you have premium but sometimes it stays on shuffle instead of going down the line of songs,1
"This app is main stream and has all of my favorite songs, artists, and podcasts. I love using this app day and night and absolutely am in love with the premium version!! I loved the end of the year wrap on Spotify where it tells you your number one listened to song and number one artist etc. Only 4 stars though because premium used to only be a dollar and now it's ten dollars a month. Please lower the premium price and this app will get 5 stars for sure!!",1
"I've been a spotify premium member for as long as they've been out. Due to divorce I lapsed and for the first time I experienced spotify free, don't use this, the last month's has been atrocious. I'm a life long customer and it's terrible. If you can't pay for premium LATTERLY ANY OTHER MUSIC Survice IS BETTER. 10/10 DO",0
Why did you remove the feature to slide a song to the side to put it in your queue in the 'liked songs' list. I enjoyed that feature. It still works in playlists which is weird.,1
Music can make or break my day and Spotify is a vibe. I love the new music I have discovered over the years with Spotify's made for you playlists & the daily mix customized for me. Thanks!,1
Good app for songs and easy to use.,1
The best music choices....there is no comparison.,1
Stop muting my PC when I'm playing through my phone OR vice versa!! I want the option to play both playing at the same time!! THIS SHOULD NOT BE A PREMIUM MEMBERS FEATURE! ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬,0
i can't download song and my song are not in offline playlist i have to use my data to listen to the songs,0
I had a best experience with this app but as time goes it doesn't play my playlists anymore,0
"Spotify is the best source of music there is, and thank god they've fixed the crashing problem.",1
It is great but the new layout is bad and awkward,0
It's terrible I have to wait an hour just to skip 6 more times this app is horrible,0
"removed the option to play samples when adding new music to playlists, this makes ot so awkward and genuinely annoying to make playlists now",0
"Just sitting here with a podcast on, probably about half way through the episode, suddenly, the app skips to some seemingly random different episode, and loses track of when the last episode left off.",0
Super easy to use and the best app ever,1
"I'm on premium but not for much longer with these latest changes! The media player bar is gone, can't turn off shuffle, spotify doesn't come up in my phone's status bar when playing anymore, can't get songs off the queue list even by completely closing the app, can't pause music in the app so I'm having to completely close the app. I can't believe they expect people to pay for this with all these horrible changes. I know I won't be for much longer unless they fix all this very quickly!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Love it, it's been a year and a half since I purchased the premium version",1
Love the app so far. Very good selections of music for all taste.,1
Sometimes it makes me wait to listen to a song and I have to sit there and listen to like 20 adds for that one song it passing me of spotify...,0
"The new update is trash. The ""now playing"" keeps disappearing and when it does, you have to restart the app if you want to skip/rewind/see what song is playing, etc. PLEASE FIX.",0
The latest update had bug ut keeps crash and does not show the play/pause bar untill close the whole app and run it all over again,0
"Music, music and more music. Access possibly the most complete library of recordings known to mankind, with Spotify.",1
"I can't take specific song off my queue, one thing Soundcloud wins at",0
"Love the app, use the calculator functiion often. I can't seem to get Spotify to work though, it just says install and takes me to the play store page for spotify?",0
Love Spotify honestly. I pay for the premium so no ads but even without premium it's amazing ðŸ˜,1
"even in the newest version(8.7.38.667), I still can't view the lyric",0
"Good app, just not so many adds would be good and it gives me 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening but i didnt ask for it",0
Sometimes my spotify plays random music not in ny playlist,0
"Endless bugs, developers need to try using their own app on different devices. I've been paying Â£10 a month for years for premium but the app barely works now, wonder if i can migrate my playlists over to youtube music..",0
Its a great app but I wish you could click on the images and wish they would give information on the artist like musicians and producers on the recordings,0
ads really sucks,0
I've always loved this app but lately it has been randomly pausing while playing via Bluetooth and most of the time it is impossible to pause a song or change songs because the now playing bar disappears.,0
Won't allow you review songs before downloading them. They need to revise that.,0
Where are the controls for the music? It was simply removed for days and no fix yet? I wonder if no one working in the app noticed this major flaw.,0
"I had issues with my app on my phone so I emailed and it was fixed so quickly, same day I emailed. Great customer service :)",0
I enjoy being able to listen to a variety of music with interference from adds.,1
I pay premium. Spotify keeps logging me out of the app meaning I need to enter my password every few days which is annoying and ridiculous. Also the shuffle option algorithm isn't great- it plays the same songs over and over almost in the same order. It feels like I listen to the same 100 liked songs over and over again,0
"Sincerely I don't recommend this app, it's so bad, without premium it's so desperating cause the long ads you can't skip, when you try to play a song you just can't, YouTube and their ads are a million times better and with premium it's not even good enough, you don't have many songs in the app and you need to go to other app if you want to listen, I sincerely recommend you to buy YouTube Premium, it's much better",0
Very good/nice/Great/awesome/ appðŸ‘ðŸ‘ lot of song for ðŸ†“ðŸ†“ðŸ†“ðŸ†“ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
Has been a great app for years but recently has become very over engineered and buggy,0
The platform has been recommending me to listen to Joe Rogan podcast. And this content included health misinformation and promotion of dangerous conspiracy theories. Do not recommend.,0
Spotify is a great music and podcast App. So much better than U tube. Enough said.,1
"Spotify was great when it first started however, I've been having to turn to youtube red due to all the Spotify bugs. Lately this app has been crashing, some of the crashes are exiting out randomly, not pulling up my DOWNLOADED songs which shouldn't be an issue, not pulling up the app at all and finally it won't let me restart the song it'll just keep playing when I hit back. This is my second 2 star review by the way, I left a review 3 months ago and I've seen little to no progress.",0
My app works great. I stopped updating and have no issues ðŸ˜†,1
"Absolutely great app and so affordable and literally has any song, any podcast & tailor made recommendations just for you - so awesome. HOWEVER, if multiple devices are using the account, only one device can listen at a time - probably some profit scheme to get people to pay for their own individual accounts K bye :)",1
Easy and relaxing,1
All songs are available this site thanks to Spotify I am very impersive I am downloaded 5th tym good job Spotify.,0
"i always play music on stpotify when i'm studying or sleeping, even though there's some ads it doesn't bither me that much",0
This app is good for music. However I have 2 complaints. 1. The play lists are always the same. Amazon music mixes up their music. But more importantly: 2. I don't see any lyrics!?!?,0
Please make better changes I think it's good but I don't like some of the updates you made in it it's a really good app though,1
"Seriously, can you please stop breaking Chromecast Audio casting on Android. It's like roulette as to whether I can use it or not.",0
Still the best among the rest....bunches of songs library. Perhaps improvement on recommended/proposed music or chart....to be more relevant with user preferences (needs an AI though).,1
Happy to find stuff I enjoy and so easy.,1
Never disappointed in the songs they have except all the dammm adds,1
I'm having it 4 stars because lately whenever I play music it'll freeze for like 2 or 3 seconds and then continue playing and its gotten really frustrating. I've tried re-download the app and my music but nothing seems to work,0
Ads so many ads kinda to much ngl,0
It's a great app but in the new update they updated icons which doesn't looks good. Old icons looked better.,0
Very nice selection of music,1
Only ads and didn't give premium even after paying,0
After update. Unable to control with my sport gear 3 watch. Would give negative stars if possible. It is really that bad!!!,0
Sometimes there are just too many commercials but still my go to music app.,0
Too much ads...... But good ðŸ‘ listening ...... But I need more and more song's should have lyrics ðŸ˜....... All best ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ very good app ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ good experience...... ðŸ˜˜ And that's all Thank you,1
It's a really good app to use while sleeping or when ur doing work but there are just UNLIMITED amount of ads. Like 1 song plays then there will be like 3 ads and that's just ruins the fun. Overall it's the best app to listen music!,0
I like finding the music I like. I'm only kinda upset that 'Knife In My Back' By Alec Benjamin isn't on here.,0
Best app for song...less add and best song can be found ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,1
It's so annoying like I wanna listen to madonna and I've already listen to it and I listen to it again but it shuffle so it's only on Spotify ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜­ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜¡,0
Never expected such a drastic update,1
Don't know happaned to this app but it is slow now.....to play or find a song takes forever now... it is very irritating and i seriously consider unsubscribing and quitting using it,0
"This app is great but everytime I'm listening to my liked song list, a song that isn't on the list or a familiar artist pops up and play. I have to delete the app and download it back and that happens when I add a new song. So can you plz fix thisðŸ¥º",0
"They don't pay artists nearly enough, they have a monopoly on the market, and the app doesn't always work as advertised.",0
It was easy to choose who I wanted to listen to and I love it.,1
"Fabulous. Bye bye CD, LP & cassette collection of 1,000+ albums, hello unlimited music ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜",1
It's really good for listening to music and I haven't dealt with problems yet at all which I can't say for all but if you just feel like listening to music Spotify is a good resource,1
"In the last few weeks the app has been unstable with the control banner at the bottom of the screen disappearing, with no way to control the music other then to select a new song or playlist. Constantly having to un/reinstall the app multiple times a day just for it to work for 2-3 songs before the same issue. You can tell when the apps breaks as the control from the lock screen and the swipe down control disappear too (android user). Have updated my phone os and still facing issues.",0
The best! Especially since Neil Young us out! Way to stand up for freedom Spotify!,1
SONGGS ,1
This app is very good put too much adds and everytime asking to upgrade into prime,1
Love it!! Except the ads hehe,1
MODIFIED APK IS LEGIT never got into any trouble like ads cant skipresumeshuffle songs and btw I should be your brand ambassador by now cause like every now and then I keep telling people to download Spotify Mod apk like genuinely Im not even bragging in love with Spotify for a very long time nowAnyway I bought premium huh idk why my life was goin great even when I hadnt bought the membership waste of money Thank you,1
"I just have one problem with this app otherwise it's all good. The problem is that I put recive notifications and autoplay on one of my podcasts. And now even after stopping notifications, deleting the app and adding it again and again, still continues to auto play even after trying to fix so that it will no longer auto play. Fix this please. And Thank-you. Other than that the app is all gravy baby",0
I absolutely LOVE my spotify app! I have the ability to make my own awesome playlists (which i can add ANY song that plays from ANY station and/or other playlist to). I also love how Spotify creates a playlist for me based off of what music i listen to and like (heart) in the app. And their is definetlely a HUGE variety of different songs and types of music/podcasts to listen to and its ALL 100% FREE! The ONLY thing i really dislike about the app is that i am not able to just search specifc song,1
"I like this app because, all the songs are found in this. And the sound quality is great too.ðŸŽ§",1
Best ever App I used to listen to my favourite music. I like the suggestions it makes once it knows what you listen to.,1
I'm rating this app for 4 star because its songs touch my heart but i can't see much more remix in this app so please try to upload much more remix,0
I use Spotify almost everyday for podcasts and music and my experience is always positive ðŸ‘,1
I cannot like the horror story but you can send me a horror story next time you can send me horror story so I am delete you your this app understand,0
"Overall, it is a good app. I do not use any other music app. However, some of the updates will mess up the app. Thankfully I was able to resolve to problem with the help from others that had a similar experience of music and playlist not displaying.",0
Not bad great app. Continue promoting the music,1
I love this app so much! It's my only music software I chose after using them all,1
Clear sound. I always prefer Spotify to listen music.,1
Good stuff,1
...'plugged' in a few artists and get more artists and tunes I like.,1
Good,1
"Keep having to uninstall then re-install. I listen to podcasts and when it's working normally, if you click on the podcast it brings you to where you left off. But more often than not it doesn't give you the option. Then it stops randomly. You have to search back through to where you were before. Its really really annoying.",0
"I have to say, very convenient app for music in one place but YouTube music is better at finding the vibe of a song.",0
Please where did the shuttle button go??? Or is it just my phone or what?? As in what the hell is going on?? How would one always play the same songs all the time#borinnnnnnnnggggggggg,0
"Podcast playlists don't have a shuffle toggle off option. If you shuffle a music playlist then play a podcast playlist, your podcast playlist will shuffle until you go back to music and toggle shuffle.",0
Awesome,1
Since a few days the app is asking for permission to detect nearby Bluetooth devices every single time I open the app. Every single time. There is no way to dismiss the message entirely and it's just annoying. I don't need for Spotify to have those permissions.,0
I have been using Spotify for years now after switching from IOS to Android and I absolutely love it. Don't have to worry about purchasing the songs and the device options for connecting are excellent. I especially love that I can connect it to my fitbit,1
Fantastic app. Especially loving the lyrics And the enormous range of music,1
Excellent music variety.,1
Easy to use and has a bunch of variety. Love this app.,1
"Since last update the app is unreliable. Crashes a lot, starts playing on it's own, the mini player on the notification bar doesn't show or doesn't work, Bluetooth devices are all over the place. please roll back",0
I just love this app way better than any other that works amazing everywhere I go try it out don't be scared don't love it too,1
Buena esperanzas,1
The only thing I dont like is constant ads. Or I can't click on the music I want to play unless I have premium,0
this app was good in 2017,1
Spotify is good. No issues.,1
I liked this at first because I got to pick my songs in my playlist. But lately the ads have been ridiculous. Every so often I have to listen to 5-7 ads between songs! I try to listen to music on my way home from work (I live pretty close) and don't end up getting to because I just listen the the ads the entire time so a rough estimate for the time of ads would be about 3-4 minutes of ads.,0
Latest update has issues. App keeps closing and I have to start the playlist over. Also doesn't have the currently playing banner on the bottom. Please fix.,0
Spotify went from songs not staying downloaded to becoming unresponsive and bricking my phone when it becomes stuck ðŸ™ƒ,0
Great app and easy to use. Very convienient to have music always avaliable and great to be able to download songs when the internet is not avaliable.,1
I was having issues for a little bit but the support chat helped me a lot before nothing was working so I contacted support at one point everything was deleted all the music on my playlists were gone that I had added over the last 10+ years but they helped me get it all back!,0
"Worked perfectly fine and great till an update a month or two back, half the time I listen to music it stops after a song when repeat is on on a playlist and have to restart the app.",0
Good variety but on the free version I'm getting 2 to 3 ads for every song played. Too annoying.,0
Best clear song app but app sound slow please fix thoda,0
"It's such a good app, I love it. But the problem is; I don't have the lyrics feature which is kind of weird. I have 3 Spotify accounts but only 2 of them that has the lyrics feature. The other account doesn't have it eventhough it's a Premium account. Please help me with this issue. Thank you.",1
"No this app is trash. Too slow to respond just like the creators. Unauthorized song has replace MONEY by LISA on your TTH, now it is either unavailable in Top 200. Will you really allow someone hacking your app? Please move and address this issue. Thank you.",0
I have only used Spotify on my phone and I love it. Some of the best feature is the ability to make playlist and the variety of podcasts and songs available. I appreciate the freedom to choose what music or podcasts I want to listen to. Thank you.,1
i want to be able to swipe to add to que like ios. also pls make it easier to change the order of the playlist on both android and laptops.,0
"three stars cuz I'm facing a big glitch. i can listen to the song i want and the quality is good and all but it aint showin any option to play the same some on repeat. like dude i really need to stren some songs yk please fix this glitch, apart from this its a pretty good app ngl",1
I'm having the same issues as others. Music controls not appearing so can't play/pause/skip songs. Also not working on Android auto anymore,0
This is a perfect platform for songs and musics,1
Would be 5 starts if we get the shuffle downloaded songs button,0
"Like Spotify, but often dislike the recommendations based on my playlist, especially when driving. Maybe it's because of my random taste in music.",0
"I wa good until it started playing 'recommended' songs, it would even let me choose the song I wanted to play, it's a stupid idea.",0
I can't play my download song when I turn off my wifi. Even if its in offline mode,0
"Where is the now playing bar? The app randomly stops playing now, or It keeps playing and won't stop when disconnected causing me to relaunch to close the app. I can't pause, skip , or even see what I am listening to. I had premium before , but canceled it & had been listening fine for months without issues until recently. Pretty important feature to not be working, hope its a bug and fixed soon. Or this is a deal breaker for me.",0
Amazing app best for streaming music,1
Honestly love this app any new music you know genres I listen to they always bring it in you know it's affordable never had any issues,1
Excellent sound quality,1
"Literally littered with bugs! Since about a month the app is becoming slowly unusable. Songs stop in the middle and restart, the currently playing is not showing anymore, it crashes randomly and so on. Come on Spotify do something about it!",0
Best ad listening aap. Plz show only one ad for people who don't have premium. Due to some reasons only we can't have premium. Show some less ad,0
"Don't know if this app could be any worse, updates that no one wanted, constantly undownloading songs even though when I connect back to WiFi they reappear... Christ sort it out already, before someone who cares even a little bit overtakes you *cough* apple music *cough*",0
"My Spotify keeps crashing, please work on it.",1
It isy humble request to Spotify developers that you add the feature that listen to ads one time and then watch without ads for 30 minutes and after 30 minutes expire's then after after another ad it should provide another 30 minutes ad free listening and so on,0
"It's a very good app for music lisners, but I think you should add a lyric translator also in this app to understand lyrics of different languages ðŸ™„ðŸ™ðŸ»ðŸ’œ",1
"Having used both Spotify and apple music for years I can say Spotify is better in terms of music collection. However it's a very buggy app and I don't have an ""old"" phone. For example the app crashes without fail when I'm looking up the #2020wrapped stats. The way Spotify organizes it's music playlist It's super weird and doesn't suggest artists I actually listen to. They need to work on organizing the music better and suggestions.",0
"I love how Spotify constantly analyzes your music, whether it's old or new and puts together numerous Playlist Recommendations that include music you know & music that you're not familiar with but sounds like something you might enjoy !! (*And, of course, you can pick and choose WHATEVER music, podcast you want, at any given time ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ§ðŸ¥ ðŸ“» )",1
It is a amazing app for listening songs but a lot advertisements is to high in between songs,1
Very easy to use,1
"Lately paying for premium doesn't seem worth it. Their app is awful. I've had issues with it randomly skipping songs, starts playing after I pause it in my car, and now it won't show the controls at the bottom. Several times today I had the issue of getting into my car and it say ""Spotify is trying to play"" while playing music, but the app wasn't open on my phone. If this continues I'm ending my subscription. Very unfortunate considering how long I've been a premium member.",0
You should put lyrics on every songs And this is a very good app,1
All the music you want and more....,1
"STOP CHANGING MY LAYOUT. This time, I can't even play the songs. I love Spotify, but I'm almost giving up. These changes of layout are horrible, please stop.",0
I love to use this app it has all for my favorite things like Gospel music on it and I like that music.,1
Love listening to beautiful music the kind I like. So easy to spend the whole day just listening.,1
Love it! With the music I listen to there are little to no ads at all.,1
App works fine for the most part. One small problem I have been facing lately is the inability to swipe and clear the music player from the notification centre even when the music is stopped. The player only disappears when I close the app completely.,0
"+he Volume Level feature isn't working, was working before +he last 2 updates!",0
Please make hifi music available as well!!,1
"The app used to be great but recent updates have caused issues with connectivity and playback buttons dissappearing! I now have to close the app to stop music. Wonderful. Surprising though, that there are no issues with billing whatsoever!",0
"I have to understand this app since it refuses to close and stay closed. I listen to something on the app and then I swipe the app closed on my phone and 10 minutes later it pops back up starts playing again and I swipe the clothes again and start listening to a different app, and all the sudden Spotify starts back up again.",0
"Spotify music app is a unique app unquantifiable to other apps, all types of music is found there in. Bravo to Spotify music app, Wonderful. Thanks.",1
"I absolutely hate this app. The adds very very irritating. I know you are trying to force people to buy sprtify premium but enough is enough. Adds come almost after every 2 song. And not just one add, it's 2 adds. This is horrible. Trying to force customers into buying premium by irritating them while they listen to music. This app sucks ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼",0
I love it for music and podcasts,1
Love the oldies that come up. The ones that bring back great memories,1
I listened to podcasts i didn't like and can't take them of my home page I don't want to see them every time I open the app I am very annoyed,0
Awesome app but can reduce ads for free users,0
"un-subscribe and moving away from spotify. get frustrated, app having problem they not able to solve but blame my devices! I tested with couple of similar music apps with same devices set-up, all working fine. Finally decided go to Tidal. Goodbye Spotify.",0
"The app is really dump, I can't make an international payment because I'm not doing it outside the country of where my credit card was issued, uÅ¾kniso",0
It's an exceptional collection of music you can't stop listening to ... That's what this app provides you.,1
"Spotify for me is like the No. app that I use to listen to music especially during my studies,",0
"it's very good! I wish there would actually be 30 mins of no interrupted listing, but in reality it's only 10. but def recommend",1
"It just stops playing music and podcast it will work for a song or two or 10 minutes into a podcast then it just stops, play bar is going like you just started the app up, doesn't remember that played a song or where it stopped in song or podcast. Then you have to go back in the app find where you stopped hearing the content. Got full bars, 5G unlimited plan no where near the ramp down limit so it's not that. Pandora and utube music play just fine. Starting to wonder why I pay for this when it",0
"Hi, new update does not show currently playing song (even though there is background music). The screen for currently playing song disappeared and it is VERY hard to navigate. New update lags music, current song not on display, app does not connect to bluetooth properly. We are paying for this so please fix it asap. Thank you",0
"I use Spotify all the time, it helps me sleep, it lessens my anxiety... But for some reason recently it won't let me heart songs or hide them... It's not too big of an issue I guess but I would like it to be seen to",1
"Spotify is amazing.I use for my kids when on road trips, and I use it when I need some time to my self but still need music I give it a 5/5",1
"Resent update has caused app to lose major functions. 1) listening to song and random stops/pause track. 2) progress/sound bar in app and notification drop-down not showing so unable to pause or next track unless tapping next song manually. Please patch asap, long time user and this is first time it's caused the app almost inoperable for continuing use.",0
Its a good app for misic so i do recomend for school and otger puppese.,0
"I am thisclose to switching my subscription from YT to Spotify!! Great music, awesome podcasts, all with minimal (or no?) censorship. The app itself functions great and is user friendly. It's definitely winning me over!",1
"Every update makes it worse. There's no controls, it keeps cutting out. Can you provide an older working version?",0
Would like a seek bar on android auto.,0
Has been terrible the last couple of weeks. Frequently stops in the middle of tracks. Cannot pause or stop. Please fix.,0
"Suddenly the user interface from the lock or home screen has become unusable. Can't pause, play, or go back and forth most of the time and have to close and restart the app. Please fix",0
"Can't search for songs when connected to WiFi. It says no internet connection, even though it can continue playing from the playlist and network being fine. I'm facing the same issue for almost a month now and no successive update seems to fix it. Now I need to find a older version of Spotify. Newer updates keep screwing up the experience",0
"I've recently purchased the Google Pixel 6 Pro and noticed that Spotify has been crashing several times per day to the point where I have to power off my device b/c (play, pause) are not visible. Can anyone provide an explanation as to why this is happening all of a sudden?",0
Bad content. If I go into any more detail than that the review gets deleted. Spotify clearly doesn't like free speech as much as it says it does.,0
The issue on your playlists including TTH where 'MONEY' by LISA has been replaced with an unauthorized song with an identical name is still not fixed. Please rectify this!!!,0
Glad the car mode is back,1
"Our family loves Spotify, use it everywhere!",1
Great variety & easy to navigate.,1
Junk never works pos app,0
"I can't get a song in this I was tryna get the song ""tongue twister"" by cash cash but it says it's unavailable to play ðŸ˜•",0
Recent update has resulted in many flaws. Can't stop music from playing unless you force shut down. Music stops playing in the middle of songs. Can't select the playing song anymore to see lyrics or videos. Can't pause. Please fix and I will change my rating,0
"Anyone having trouble with the app currently, I uninstalled and re-downloaded the app again and it fixed the issue.",0
Bro where did the option to review the songs before adding them to you Playlist go. It's so stupid like why take it away. Not to mention the countless adds after every 2 songs,0
Good selection and sound quality. Easy navigation. A lot of settings.,1
"Love the app's content, but FIGURING OUT how to navigate the app is a bit confusing for someone like me, with little app experience other than fb, etc.",0
"Hello Spotify team! I am recently having a problem with Spotify that is I can't log in my old account I always try but never work even if I try to sign in it's still not work it's not making my account neither letting me use my old account please solve this problem I really love Spotify songs, I hope you will get this problem repair soon thank you!",0
Why I can't install Spotify in Samsung Galaxy Watch 4? Can't support?,0
Simple and convenient app for music.,1
The timing of droping ads are too poor. Like I don't know if it is a glitch or something but I am repeatedly getting ads in the middle of songs which is not good ðŸ˜žðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜Ÿ And I hope they will fix it as soon as possible otherwise the app and it's sound quality is very good. ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,0
So easy to access. Educational and entertaining.,1
it's just wicked after i found all but more reggae to be featured..also ghana good funky hilife music .. also got all that old funk music..soft rock.. etc... keep it going..i am on full blast.. just keep me spotified..,1
Spotify keeps stopping and I no longer have control of the music. I can't even top the music from playing. I have to restart my phone to make it stop. I can no skip forward or backwards. I paid for premium. It is currently a worthless mess!,0
I love this app it has good music!,1
My experience with Spotify is really awesome! The thing I most like about Spotify is the 'daily playlist' that really contains the songs of my choice so i don't have to do constant searching for finding songs of my taste. So for me Spotify is my daily go app for songsðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,1
I really love app but it plays songs I do not have on my playlist and I really do not like that and every time I play another playlist it always plays songs that are not on my playlist and that pisses me tf off,0
"This was great till it got over run by count less adds and not to mention that there are songs that I used to love listening to that now show that they are hidden and I cant unhide them, it's not that i cant find them, it's that they are just permanently hidden or almost like they're banned",0
"Deserves 0 stars for blatant obvious reasons. Get rid of Joe Rogan then I'll possibly reconsider using Spotify again. Plus it constantly ran in the background even after closing it, and draining my battery faster.",0
"Despite being off line, and not even listening to music this app used nearly 1GB data!",0
Easy to use always find what I'm looking for,1
"I've had 2 phones and this is app is ridiculously slow, takes ages to show my downloaded songs EVEN WHEN I'M NOT ON THE INTERNET I've deleted my cache, and more. But no this app is goddamn terrible. Ugh",0
"The song and everything is great but when I open it and play a song, it will automatically take me back to my home screen and the song won't play as well, my phone is a vivo Y21T",0
"Love the app works well on everything I have, security is a bit iffy since I've had issues in the past with people actually having into my account which is why I give 4 stars but pairs well with my crypto card, android and watch and usually has good prices and deals!",1
Recommended songs. Stop. It's annoying,0
I already pay for premium. DISABLE. THE F**KING. POPUPS. We've been telling you for AGES. Deezer and YouTube Music never felt so enticing.,1
Very bad app my heads pain by using this app After one or two songs adv. Come again and again. And the adv. Make more headache by saying rubbesh things and the adv. The adv. Come long..,0
"there is a problem in my phone where i cant listen to music, im using the same account on my pc and phone but i cant listen to music on my phone. it shows me add songs only.",0
As of the latest update Spotify keeps using (tons of) mobile data although I am only listening to downloaded podcast episodes. The data usage is so high that it seems like it keeps re-downloading stuff in the background while on mobile data.,0
Spotify is the best music and podcast platform web design is easy to use and no hassle payment at a reasonable cost. Keep up the Awesome work!!!ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,1
I love it better than YouTube music or apple,1
Decent app,1
Best app for music and the free premium for a month is good to,1
I downloaded songs and next day it's showing downloading agian. If we use data to download daily we can play songs online only na. Why offline mode?,0
Worst worst app i hate this app a lot of ads making me irritating and not at all giving pleasant music with this stupid ads and subscription is highly cost and i feel so bad about it ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
Its nice,1
Spotify is a good platform for music I have only one complain that they don't provide canvas in India every thing else is fine,1
"Everything is good about it. But, I canceled my subscription weeks before it was set to renew and still got charged 12 dollars so that is very upsetting.",0
"Ten commercials for two songs. 45 minutes from work, Got five songs in. Got so bad after the whole Rogan thing, not even useable.",0
"Would be a lot better if I could hear a specific song, instead of hearing one by the same band. I often find myself going to YouTube if I want something specific.",0
Well organized intuitive interface.,1
It's amazing you can get any song you want; but you may need to turn on your data and it's annoying.,0
"When I play my downloaded songs, there are times when it stops out of nowhere...and it's not that my speaker needs charging.",0
"Don't use often enough to make paying viable so use the free version can be a bit anoying with strange adds, but still ok.",1
Too slow to load,0
"AVOID THIS APP!!! you are better off listening to song on YouTube. I uninstalled it 2 hours after I installed it. You can search for a song but when you try to play it Spotify decides you really should listen to another. I searched for Should Have Been a Cowboy, song not album. I hit the play button and what comes out of my phone? Bubby Shot the Jukebox. Ok, I must have done something wrong so I do it again. I never did get this steaming pile of fecal matter to play it get correct song.",0
"app is and always was amazing,, even going 3 years back, this is still my 'one of choice'. however recently i downloaded it for mobile and soon found out that after a certain amount of time, you can't play any song from a certain folder you made that you wish to play ; instead having to just play it on shuffle,, annoyingly enough.",0
Spotify is the best of all music archives. The quality of music is just but phenomenal on their free plan. I wonder what is inside the premium plan. Glory obviously!,1
It is an amazing app like everything is proper but few song are not synced except this everything is excellent,1
"Upd: watch your language Spotify and don't command me like that: ""Update your payment methods NOW!"". I won't update anything if I don't want to. I'm tired that I can't add to blacklist ONE specific track from recommendations/radios. I block it every day and Spotify continues to add it in my auto generated playlists. It's hard to reorder playlist in Android app.",0
Good songs quality,1
Very easy and quick to use and straight forward,1
I love Spotify. Very essy to use. Lots of music to choose from.,1
"App randomly stopped working after the last update, tried reinstalling it couple of times didn't help.",0
I like spotify it is good . Pls put new songs on it .,1
"It has a nasty habit of mixing Red Hot Chili Peppers in with my death metal playlists, but other than that, it's pretty good.",1
"Spotify been a best platform for me,keep it up guys",1
Why does it keep on asking me to allow Bluetooth when I click on allow every single time? The app is also failing in many ways. It's highly disappointing,0
I am really enjoy spotify app,1
"I could not live without Spotify. It's the best medicine ever. Through your own individual choose of music, Spotify will set up playlists for songs of the genre you like, which helps you connect with old and new music. Spotify has saved me in my darkest of places in the corners of my mind. It's fantastic value for money and it helps the environment by not buying CDs etc. Well done Spotify. You're here with now and you'll be there at the end. There's so much talent around eg Thomas Rhett... xxx",1
Awesome App but it's dosen't open when i turn on my WiFi so please solve this matter ThankyouðŸ’œ,0
It's easy to use and helps me discover new music.,1
my favourite thing in the world is putting on some indie pop while reading heartstopper for the billionth time!! ðŸâ¤ï¸,1
"I like some of the newer features, but I have two problems with the current version. 1. When I'm listening, every minute or so it pauses for a few seconds even if I have a great signal and speed, 2. I really hate the fact it auto plays EVERY SINGLE TIME I connect to soemthing over bluetooth I've tried blocking all permissions and turning off related settings but nothing stops it even if the app is not even open. I don't want this, please let me turn it off so it only plays when the app is open.",0
"Nice apps, chillax listening to musics",1
i dont like it for example you only get 6 skips an HOUR i hate that plus i cant copy the album:/ fix it now,0
"I've been using this app for 4 years,but the new update is getting on my nerves.If you want to listen to a song you can't listen to it first if you even wanted to, instead it puts the songs in a order where you can't choose which one you wanna listen to first. Not only that, but when I tap on a song to listen to it instead of showing the play button it shows other songs and not the one I wanted to listen to. It is also frustrating when I wanna play a song on my playlist.",0
This app suckssssss better than this I wish I will not listen song,0
Canceling subscription fixes all bugs with the app,0
"Very nice app made by what seems to be very nice people, just kind of noticed that while using the app",1
Ok so here's the deal Spotify has this new update where they add there recommended songs on there...this is a problem because you come to Spotify yo listen to your Playlist and the music you like now all you here on YOUR Playlist is songs you don't know and can't sing along to...the only way to get rid of it is by adding at least 15 songs to your Playlist! So me being like ok I did so...for awhile everything was good but the Spotify kept playing songs that I didn't add! USELESS!!!,0
"I have enjoyed Spotify, and I even have a podcast. I like the grouping of music and suggestions of podcasts that happens in the App. It's really easy to use and provides a range of options in entertainment.",1
Ads are ok till a limit but now its crossing the line ..... I know u want every user to join your premium packages but if you are giving free the pls don't give this much ads ....i listen to 4 songs and after every song I have to listen to the ads and its completely irritating ....either make your app fully premium or remove excess ads ... Worst experience didn't expected this after being such an active user since so many years ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,0
This app is very good and very interesting....but I choose to give it four stars because a person can't switch themes at anytime he/she wants,1
App contacts Spotify and shows preferences but doesn't provide Playlist when you click on selected items.,0
There r too many ads while listening online otherwise it the most awesome app I hv ever seen â˜º,1
It's so nice to use Spotify,1
Not good app can't skip songs,0
Great app so much old school music love itðŸ‘,1
"The worst, most unstable app I've ever used for Android. Audio goes out when screen turns off, audio controls frequently crash while playing, integrated ads crash podcasts, audio skips, etc. I want to support Spotify because of commitment to free speech, but such an awful, unstable POS makes it a challenge.",0
it is number one in my eyes it hits top charts with music artisist you like all variety music that is great listening app i love it !,1
Playlist are virtually useless since it floods the songs you want with random garbage and doesn't let you choose your preferred song. It's just so money grabbing. Only way to use this app is through premium.,0
Ive always loved spotify and it great for listening to music I dont have premium but the only complaint I have is that the lyrics never load for most songs for me Not sure if thats just for me but it would be great if that could be fixed Other than that I love this app,1
Nvr go for free plan. I have faced the worst experience. Those MF still charging me 117 even after i cancel the subscription. Seems like i have to change my DEBIT CARD. Blody MF,0
I used to love this app but it's become unusable as of late on Android.,0
Had to delete. Free version is really bad and an extra $9.99 every month is not an option I can afford to do with gas prices going up and cost of living,0
I am editing this review i earlier rated it 5 but now after you know which updates i am rating it what it deserves,1
Excellent app for music and podcasts.,1
Spotify always hits the spot of feelings when i need a song. They have a great selection and never disappoints.,1
"April 18 edit: App is barely usable anymore. Controls gone, music abruptly stops every couple seconds. The past few updates have made the app take steps backwards, not forwards. Original: The new update is garbage, so buggy. Randomly stops, can't type to search, freezing, the odd time crashes my phone. Barely even usable atm. Ready to cancel.",0
"Not sure what's happened, but since last few updates the shuffle feature has gotten worse and worse. Kinda annoying only hearing 10 songs from a playlist on repeat due to the problems with it.",0
I believe that they should NOT add random somgs into your Spotify playlist and expect you to like it :// and the fact that you can't even choose the songs that you wanna hear is highly wrong >:(,0
Nice addition to my utillity,1
"I love it, but lately is being really sucks, I can't see which sing is playing, the song stop for seconds ðŸ˜« don't want it",0
Just too much of advertisement. Which gets irritable.,0
This is good app to learn songs but when the 60 days free premium us finished I got angry but also I give 5 star  to this super songs and some days free premium,1
My only complain is not being able to download a single song... Like i have to create a playlist everytime to download a song,0
Great sound tracks.,1
Spotify absolutely blows Pandora out of the water. Never looked back.,1
Out of this World,1
Spotify is a really good app that doesn't have a lot of ads and even when it does they are only short so I realy enjoy this app and if you choose artists to like they will appear on your home screen,1
"Jabarjast, great no words it has memories my old fav song of reel which I have been forgot.",0
Too much ads ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²,0
Please remove this chand waliyan song from ad after every song it pops out If it continues Then I will uninstall spotify,0
I love this app sm bc it has all of my fav songs and playlist,1
Its free and I listen to my favorite songs! The only thing thats annoying bout it is that It can be frustrating to find the song you want.,0
"Update 1/6/22.. The app is even worse on Android, looks like everyone else is having similar issues even on Premium (which I'm using) so I'll be using a different service til this is fixed... - It's terrible at the moment, the music controls keep showing a completely different song to what's playing and I have to force close the app just to stop playing a song as the controls don't work, I'm using premium too...",0
I would give it a 5 star but I'm not. Don't get me wrong this app is amazing. Every now and then I can pause the music or skip the music. It just won't give me the option. Please fix it.ðŸ™,1
I need to cancel this app please give me link so I can cancel my member this app so poor not many song like I use with YouTube music,0
I love this app but why my app didn't update whenever I want to update it...please do something....,0
Best app ever!!!! Love it just wish it wasn't so expensive....tbh it's worth it,1
"Excellent, the way it syncs with other devices makes it a breeze to use. Hugh library of music, I have not found something that it is not in the catalog yet. The only thing is that my flac files still sound better, even when Spotify is set to the maximum quality.",1
Spotify is hands down the best music app I love it,1
"The good things about spotify were probably already said by other users so let me review the negative side. Sometimes i feel uncomfortable while using this app because when i listen to music it suddenly stop and i had to go back open the app and check why is it stop and i need to click the pause/play button so i could continue listening the music, after i updated the app it lagging a lot!! and sometimes the lyrics won't show upðŸ˜© please fix the bugs & keep up the performance of the app.",0
"Adds random songs from a random playlist onto the current queue I'm listening to. Also, why did you get rid of the song preview? That was really useful!",0
One star because Spotify did not fullfil it's promise to launch lossless in year 2021. One less star for Lyrics issue. The design of Lyrics layout is not good as compared to other apps. The sync of song with lyrics is not good for many songs. â­â­â­â­ To â­â­â­â­â­ Because Spotify improve lyrics.. ðŸ‘,0
It's good but sometimes all song are repeating,1
"New update glitches and the music cuts out, also when the phone locks the music stops playing and that's with premium version. Is this how Spotify is going to operate now? If so I'll cancel my subscription and find another app",0
"Couldn't find anything, wouldn't let me see all the songs in a Playlist, an changed the songs in an album",0
Love spotify! Very intuitive algorithm.,1
Great but sometimes my downloaded music cannot play. I hove to connect to the internet to listen sometimes,0
Good application for lovers of music,1
Works great if you ain't broke lol,1
I love listening to Spotify,1
best songs app :),1
"To many ads and the limitations on skipping songs is ridiculous, you also should be able to search for a song and listen to the exact song and not have to listen to similar songs, doesn't make sense at all, if you are searching for a song to listen to you should be able to listen to it...",0
"Had given it 5 stars.. Until they removed the ""enhance Playlist"" feature. I'm really disappointed ðŸ˜¥",0
Just had three ads in a row. No. Just. No.,0
"I would rate it 5 stars but there is no reason to have to have Spotify premium just to go to your Playlist and pick any song that you want. If Spotify would fix it and make it to where if you go to your Playlist you could pick a song. Also, I don't want you to add songs to my Playlist I already did that. Fix it please.",0
I love Spotify but there's a real big problem with the ads I'll be listening to a song and see my favorite song coming up but when the song ends I get it with 3-10 ads and really throws off the vibe and most of the time I'll just switch to YouTube/YouTube Music please Spotify tone down the ads cuz I'm not paying money to listen to music,0
this is the best music app ever. The ads only show up every now and and when they do it's only two or three ads.,1
Luv it Downloaded it for special podcast by Erin Bailey...She is awesome..,1
It's awesome we can heare so many songs at best quality,1
"BUGG where notification disappears, play/pause interface also disappeared",0
Its great and all but u need Spotify Premium to play the songs u want. And im not paying for premium,0
Very nice app! You can use your mobile as a remote control for pc in Spotify. Just a problem and I can't play the musics directly from artist's profile and I should listen it from playlists.,0
Just recently I tried to choose a song then it automatically closes the app it's been doing this for 3 days now I've even done a factory reset and thankfully it worked but then a pop up came for something about Bluetooth for Android 12 then clicked allow. After that it did it again! Please fix this as soon as possible!!!!,0
Love the music BUT the massive volume imbalance between the music and the overloud adverts is serious annoying and needs sorting ASAP!!!!!,0
Amazing App all you need for the soul and more .. music is life,1
Love the music like how I down loady my music that I wont to hear and in order this is a really good app,1
Its like it knows me! Love it!!!,1
Loding and ads issues always,0
Spotify is the best thank you,1
By far THE BEST music platform. Majority of all music out there is on here (some exceptions - please add Travis Scott's 'Days Before Rodeo' if ya can.) But yea I love it - I make all my playlists on here. The interface makes that extremely simple and straightforward.,1
it's nice to be able to lisen to muis,1
Periodically starts playing music and not allowing me to see what's playing or change the song,0
I loved Spotify until the new upgrade. I can't stop my interaction with the app and have uninstalled it until it is fixed. Very disappointed! :-(,0
"Love that I can think of a song, and I can find it and listen to it. Woohoo!",1
"I wish the Artist Radio Stations played a wider selection of tracks, they are extremely repetitive.",0
Nice because i can play any song that i want like K-pop song,1
"This is an amazing app to listen to endless ads... only problem is , it sometimes play music interrupting your ad...but don't worry, that only happens once in a blue moon.",1
"I love it...works great and I can get just about any artist, song and album out there!! Highly recommend this.",1
It's very difficult to unsubscribe,0
Hopefully with less ads,0
I bought premium xD,1
"Was great, never had an issue before. Today it logged me out and when i try to sign in it says i have no connection. The fact that I'm posting this review on the same phone says otherwise. I cleared the cache, rebooted and nothing works. I'm paying for premium for nothing.",0
Everything is good but this app shows tooooo much ads... It's just Irritating...,0
"It is impossible to shuffle play all downloaded tracks. People have been asking for this simple, highly useful feature for years. Before that it was actually possible. Apparently the folks at Spotify have never been on a road trip through the mountains or on a flight with no internet connection. In the forums, their answer is to build a playlist; this answer is condescending and unhelpful.",0
Love this app helps me a lot with studying and others!ðŸ˜€,1
Plays music that I love as well as music that I never heard b4. Even better finding edited/clean version music to listen to with kids around.,1
It's good over all but i searched for few songs which weren't there. If that problem is fixed it will just be very fine.,1
"Ive had this app for as long as I can remeber and had no problems. Now, the app either shuts off on its own or pauses the music. Ill give a better rating when the bug gets fixed",0
"So After 3 Years I Log Back On And, ITS FIXED. THANK U SPOTIFY I WUV U! Here Is what i said on october 26 2019 : the new update is TARABLE i hate it i can't play songs from playlists i say they shold bring back the old vison and everone thats with me commit down below",0
I've been using spotify for several years and I used to be much happier with the previous versions of the app. The small issues are making me very frustrated lately. The app just randomly stops playing podcasts after a couple of minutes without the sleep time being set. I tried to change the settings in my android and nothing seems to work. Another issue that happens every day more than 10 times is the navigation bar disappears whilst a podcast being played. I have to restart everytime!!!,0
"This version its worse you cant play a song,The old version is better than this please change for us if not you are going to lose,its becoming worse",0
Love the app but it's been a bit glitchy lately in downloading podcasts. It mysteriously refuses to sync even on WiFi and the only fix seems to be to uninstall and reinstall the app.,0
"Horrible! After creating a profile the home page loaded for 6 minutes, then after my patience began wearing thin I turned my WiFi on and off, closed the app 10+ times and even uninstalled and logged in again. Nothing worked. A huge disappointment from such an acclaimed app.",0
Had to uninstall and reinstall for the second time due to years-old bug triggered by app updates when spotify set to offline mode. Cannot login unless I do this.,0
"Walking around my home, doing chores, and foot tapping with hands free.... Loving Spotify!",1
"I've been a Premium subscriber for 2 years. Value for money, will never run out of choices!",1
Easy to access,1
I am new to this and honestly I don't know how a major app like this one can't allow u to just shut down the music when u leave the app or even allow u to not auto reconnect to it every time u use Bluetooth. Seriously I tried everything but still the music plays on unless I pause it which means it's not stopped just paused and so uses my batter for no reason .that's why I deleted it,0
Unmatchable experience with uninterrupted music. Spotify is the best,1
What an amazing app cause I always work with tunes in my ears and now all my music are at my fingertips!,1
"Been a Spotifier for years, as has my whole family. Love it!",1
I've had my smart TV for 3 years. I just mounted it on the wall 2 years ago. Then I had trouble making it work. Then a friend showed me in 3-5min. I'm really enjoying all the old programs I like to watch. Thank you so very much.,1
"this afternoon I got a glitch where the ui button moved, but it didn't affect the audio quality.",0
"Worst player ever. Does not play the song I need, always plays something else. Not talking about the adds. It was not like that previously when i was using it a year ago. Decided to use it again, but deleting the app after 1 day of use. Spotify goes to the rubbish bin!",0
Too much advertisement.. I'm fed up... It ruins the mood.,0
"Best ever, i really loved it! There have many song and you guys can play your favorite song at here! Enjoy!",1
Constantly clips in and out even with 5 bars. And just try to watch it on a smart tv... I wish that Rogan was back on YouTube,0
Good and easy to use the ads can get very annoying and sometimes a random song will play and you won't be able to get onto your liked songs.,0
BOYCOTT SPOTIFY YOU CANNOT SKIP TO A SPECIFIC PART,1
"Always loved spotify, I pay for the no ads subscription. My life without music would suck and spotify gives me the joy",1
I love the features and flexibility.,1
"Love Spotify. Best music,new music and playlists.",1
"I would like to listen to my fave music whilst I'm on my phone but this app seems to want to make that impossible! Spotify works on my PC and Tablet but on my phone.. it does what it feels like. I try to play an album or a playlist and after it plays one song, it will then play something completely different that has nothing to do with the album or playlist. I've checked Settings and cannot find anything to sort this out. Unless it can be sorted, it's being removed! Can anyone help?",0
"It shuffles podcasts by default with no clear way to turn off the ""feature"". I'm also trying to use it with a Bluetooth headset and it keeps pausing randomly for no reason.",0
It works perfectly fine before but starting yesterday it won't get pass the spotify logo sign for minutes then it would freeze and exit on its own. I'm missing my playlists already so please fix it!,0
Great app! Has become an essential part of my life. But there are some smaller problems like the long loding times when opening the app. Or for some months it doesnt show a mini player anymore where you can skip a song even if the phone is locked. Every time you want to skip you have to go in the app. And also if you are in offline mode it has too long of a loading time even for your downloaded songs. If those things are fixed -> easy 5 stars,0
My experience with this app is amazing i can listen all my favourite songs while doing stuff.,1
The best songs app. I have tried many more app but Spotify I liked it the most,1
Too many advertisements. Had to listen to 10 advertisements in a row before finally listening to some music,0
Getting really tired of Spotify not loading any downloaded music while I'm offline with no internet connection. Many times i work in an environment with absolutely no cell service and I cannot play downloaded music.,0
Its good,1
"I've used Spotify for years based on European friends recommending it. Great music selection, it learns what I like, allows me to construct playlists for any occasion.",1
What happened to play pause controls. Can't see what's currently playing can't pause it either. Hope Its just the version I have. Going to uninstall and use the web version for now,0
"I was skeptical at first since I've had YouTube music forever, but after I switched over to Spotify everything was seamlessly easy. From the navigation of the app to creating my lists, I was able to get all of my music and then some back. So great job y'all.",1
Very poor for a paid service. -The music frequently stops for a few seconds -Play/pause and skip button disappears -The shuffle function favours like 20 songs I will be contacting spotify for atleast a partial refund.,0
"Love having easy access to the music, podcast and so much more.",1
I love Spotify i play music while studying,1
Why u want login? Your job is giving music not collecting people data.,0
I had a very good experience until now but Spotify robbed my money when I paid for the premium subscription and I didn't get the premium account activated after the successful payment and I still haven't received my refund back all they say is that they didn't receive the payment which was successfully from my side. Don't subscribe for premium with UPI they will rob you.,0
New update has a bug where the play controls in the app and in my push notification bar vanish after being paused for a few minutes. I have to close and reopen the app to get the controls back. Really frustrating.,0
Good app for listening music.,1
All the Jazz I love it is awesome,1
Very good an army can listen every songâ™¥â™¥,1
Songs are sometimes not shown as played in the app even though my phone is emitting the music,0
Dont you think 4 video ads in a row is a little too much? I get that you need ads in order to keep having a free version but showing them as soon as i try to play music is too much,0
Best music streaming,1
"I am a BLINK and ARMY. I love BTS, BLACKPINK, ITZY,IU SOMI ðŸ’œðŸ–¤ðŸ’ž . I always listen kpop song . This is a great app for song lovers ðŸ˜ðŸ¥° This app is fantastic. Word are less to explain. This app is so good and BLACKPINK COLLABORATION with spotify . Lovely app ðŸ˜ðŸ¥° Download spotify Songs lover ðŸ’œðŸ–¤ðŸ’ž.",1
Very Good app for listen the best song,1
I just got 6 ads in a row,0
"The app lies. I tried listening to an ad to get 30 minutes ad free, and got an ad 4 minutes later. Update: Now it doesn't do the 30 minutes ad free at all. This app is such a pain to listen to music.",0
"The app tells me to go online in order to get search results. While I don't have a great connection, I do have a connection. In fact, I am writing this 1 star review via my connection right now",0
I don't if the new version coz I downloaded the songs so I can listen even I'm offline but it didn't play some of them.,0
I really love this app I would just recommend less ads,0
"I luv listening to true crime podcasts,my favorites are murder mile,date line,48 hours and canadian true crime,I really enjoy them alot,please keep these great podcasts coming.thank u.",1
Its the best app ever but toooo many ads,0
"This app is great, but when I'm listening to my Spotify playlist when I'm going somewhere, the music will glitch on and off to the point where I get frustrated and turn it off",0
Works great and tons of selection.,1
"No support for Chromebook. Can't add my own music files unless I have a Windows or Mac machine. And even then, half of my local files play 2x faster than normal. It seems that Spotify does not care. There are countless instances online of people who have the same problem. I just want to transfer my own music to Spotify, but I have to jump through way too many hoops. I have premium and I PAY for this service so I expect to be able to use the service at its full paid capacity.",0
Me and my daughter love Spotify it's one of our most used apps,1
Love the variety of music just really wish songs wouldn't get removed weather it be the artists choice or not such as licensing I don't feel its right anyway. Beyond that I use Spotify over every other platform just wish I could view the covers via clicking on them as I was able to in previous versions to be able to see the art in a lager format is always great and it's no longer an option like it was,0
"worst music app that I used till date......more ads than music.......non sense app.....don't install it, if you don't want to waste your time and money",0
Everything went smooth until recently when canvas toggle suddenly missing even after multiple reinstall and restart. Please fix it and I'm not on data saver.,0
I don't have much to say Just that it's everything i wanted from the app,0
Best app ever for listening music and podcasts..,1
"This app does not deserve even 1 star , of course it offers high quality music but ads are very annoying in between songs also it is extended now to 30 seconds and about 2 to 3 ads of same time graph appear , Spotify pls reduce your ads time graph or reduce the premium price",0
love making playlists and i definitely recommend getting premium so you can listen to songs directly. love you spotify!,1
Worst app experience ever. So glitchy. Blend invites don't work. Find friends shuts app off. Horrible app.,0
so much fun,1
Does this app just shut itself off when an update is available idk but it's getting annoying that i have to come back every 2minutes to hit play again!,0
Horrible when you click on a song it doesn't play that song it plays a playlist and too make matter worse you can't even play specific songs on a playlist you created,0
Really good except commercial to many of them,1
I like the app but i hate hattteee when i try to find songs they are shuffled with others songs i dont like and also my playlist,0
"So there's this very annoying bug where after you go into offline mode, the app auto logs out and doesn't let me log back in. I've literally had to uninstall and reinstall the app to access my account. It's a great app and premium mode is really awesome but this bug makes it a real pain. If its fixed, I'd give the app 5 stars but till then, it stands at 4",0
Hi Spotify your app is amazing but i am facing some problem with this which is. Songs automatically stop in between overall the app is better than (I Music),0
The app will just stop playing music out of no where and if I start the music from the noti bar I can't controll the music anymore until I close the app and reopen it. This has been a problem for about a week now so I'm hoping you'll fix it as soon as possible,0
"Seems to be getting worse and worse by the day. Can't skip songs, can't pause songs, can't see what you're currently listening to. Might switch to Amazon Music",0
I love Spotify but one thing I don't like it's the fact that it's hard to just play straight songs not to skip all of time I don't like that so fix that and I'll give you 5 stars,1
Overall it's grand but when you go to edit you have to drag song to the top rather than order as recently added etc. Terrible change on Samsung,0
"cannot pay premium, chexk your settings and try again. but what setting should i check, no sense.",0
App good ads too bad one or 3 songs after 3 advertised hate this but love app songs,1
"I've been using Spotify for years now, and I love it. All the music I need is here and I have been enjoying prime student.",1
This is really very good music app,1
Way better than YouTube music.. Don't have to pay to listen to your music while phone is sleeping. YouTube stops playing..,0
"I have been Spotify user for about 5 years now. I love the application on desktop and web but the mobile app is where it gets the 3 stars. ""Car View"" was a feature that existed up until 2021 where it was ultimately removed in November. This was a SIGNIFICANT FEATURE for users without the newer car play and android auto. This feature single handedly improved safety when driving as the buttons were big enough to press. This was not a good change.",0
Very good app for musice lover,1
Quite a good application i enjoy the wide variety of music,1
"The application is good, i play any music i like with lyrics",1
Everytime I slide to the side it always come to BTS song I mean what the heck I want to listen to playlist that I has create not the BTS song everytime I slide to the side it always BTS BTS BTS so it now I feel like I want to uninstall it can you just fix it or something even i try to listen to daily mix song that have no k pop song at all and I slide to the side BTS song come out again again and again it plz I beg fix it before i uninstall it. TQ,0
Abhiram abhiram,1
Awesome. Great podcasts. Thank you for Joe Rogan! Spotify is the best!,1
It's good but sometimes it hangs There's no lyrics in phone but only in pc and tv,0
Was going fine with the app for a couple of days then all of a sudden it refused to let me in I can't listen to any of the songs on my playlist without glitching I'm very close to deleting this app ðŸ¤¬,0
I love the app but auto play sucks even if i turn it off it still plays songs that aren't in playlist please fix this issue and when i search a song and try to play it gives me a playlist and i have to got through half of it before i can find the song i want i also hate that if im just being dumb can u please explain how it work cause it keep giving playlist instead of the song,0
Sometimes clunky to navigate and I still can't fathom how to skip forward other than in 15 second intervals when I'm driving.,0
Love the Playlist of music put together for me.,1
Songs all are better. But they dont give importance to kannada songs like other language songs. So thats why i am giving 2 star,0
Because in this app bts songs are there that's why I am downloading but it is a good app ðŸ’œðŸ’œ,1
Good music variety.,1
"as a non premium user, this app just unnecessary playing ""suggested song"" that ive never want to hear and when i just started to play one playlist and then most of the songs didnt even IN the playlist so I need to skip that songs, but guess what? u cant skip more than 6 times. Its not just that, when the ad said im gonna get 30 min without ads and then theres ads... oh theres Mercedes/spotify premium ad ALWAYS pop up recently, so annoying.",0
"honestly, I enjoy making playlists the most on this app. I don't really mind the ads, it's not the WORST thing in the world. but since I mostly make playlists, I have to preview the songs first to make sure it fits what I'm asking for within the playlist. I can no longer do that? When adding songs I can't preview them anymore and that's the most annoying thing in the world for me :/ Also just straight up don't like how it's mostly for premium. It's unfun, and not a great experience overall tbh.",0
"Free music is fine, but only when you want it. On my phone, Spotify suddenly and uninvitedly switches on and plays loud music when I am trying to concentrate on my work, and there is no easy way to kill that blare. It is most inconvenient and also embarrassing, if there are others in the room working quietly.",0
"Wifi is all working fine but the songs dont play, using premium as well, dunno what's going on with the app.",0
"Love it! So much better than Pandora or GoogleMusic. I've found so many cool new artists from smaller, lesser known labels as well as my favorite 80s and 90s artists. Much larger catalog, user friendly, love the playlist creation options. I pay for my subscription. Cxl Joe Rogan. It's not that hard to do the right thing.",1
Very good app to listen to the music,1
"I love Spotify, over pandora",1
The app won't allow me to make a Playlist and listen to my songs and keeps playing random songs that I don't even like. I used to love this app but it feels like the creators just don't care anymore.,0
I love using Spotify but recently when adding songs to a Playlist they don't give a preview of the song? How am I supposed to find the exact song I wanna add or even discover something new while just browsing?,0
"Been having problems with the ""now playing"" section all together disappearing leaving no way to pause the music or get into all of those menus. Just recently started happening.",0
This is a very good app and so many songs.,1
"This is the best music, podcasts, stories listening app. Spotify is a very nice streaming platform.",1
Very pleased with this app. Great quality and good variety.,1
"Great app. Perfect for everything from songs to podcasts, and it's all free!",1
Nice app ,1
One of the best apps ever I have tried it's very amazing just that the primium prices are pretty high and would like to wish it lows down and will hope to buy someday very good app for sure,1
Must have if you love your music.ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
Amazing ,1
New update is not your best work cause i cant even pick which song i want to listen to first i only get a glimpse of it like bro and if i want to skip the damn thing i cant only 6 skips per hour and what im picking is like near the damn end of my playlist,0
Awesome app.. u will get any songs from this app which u will like,1
Good recommendations on songs that I love to listen before.,1
"I have had this for years, I love it and I can't complain, good updates and everything meets my needs, love that it is free and the subscription is nicer, but love that there is a option",1
"I just pulled Spotify back up and am blown away by the amount of commercials and the poor music choices. You really have no value offer, just more commercials will push me to not use it like I stopped using the radio.",0
Easy to use and form playlists Great entertainment,1
"Really good as me as a DJ and i can download tracks and take it anywhere, which is why i love it",1
"Need to find a platform to let them know that I want to change the day my subscription should be paid on. A simple feature that is easy to find would be great. 'til then, 3 stars",0
New update breaks in-dash headunit functionality. Not happy.,0
"I love this app, but if feels like it will never improve... sometimes it just glitches and refuses to play and you have to exist and enter again... if you try to listen at the same time with friends there's a delay between when you hear the song and they do... even to this day they haven't brought listening activity to mobile... like just have it as a tab that you can open if you want to... there are so many things they could add, but they just don't... such a shame...",0
The user interface is dang good. Sound quality ain't too bad,1
"Even when I was using the free version with ads I found the way Spotify offered selections based on what I had been listening to, really good, because it gave artist I had forgotten as well as those I had never tried.",0
"This used to be a great app but in the last 2 months it is plagued by bugs. Listening to music, podcasts etc stop while you are playing them for no reason. You cannot skip, rewind or stop while listening. I have uninstalled the reinstalled but still does not work. I am a premium member but if its not fixed soon, I can switch to another provider.",0
I best app I ever had .. it's sound quality is also good . But the thing is after every 30 min the ad comes ... But I liked this app very much .,1
"Long time user but the last update, April 2022, introduced a super annoying bug. I can't see/pause/ff the song being played until I restart. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly.",0
"This app is horrible, I can't play a single song of my choice its like picking someone else's playlist on shuffle, not picking an actual album or song you want. Its literally more convenient to just uses YouTube.",0
Great variety of music,1
"YT Music has clear and distinct quality of base and clarity of voice unlike spotify. On the other hand, I appreciate spotify if i have podcast to look listen and there are more variety of music. But I'll prefer listening to YT Music.",1
Tbh I really hate it I hate the fact that when I try to listen to my liked songs and I'm listening to melenie Martinez then when. The song ends and it starts playing some random song I've never even heard of and. The fact that we only get to skip 6 times is kind of sad I'm really thinking of switching to a different music app I really like the app over all tho,0
"The only real good way to get straight on music, in this world..",0
"Experience is good. Good UI, only problem is, if you're not on an auto-renewal subscription, when it ends, all the downloaded songs get deleted even after you subscribe again.",0
Why can't I play what I want to play and then another song comes out,0
Login doesn't work...ðŸ˜¡ Worst login criteria not able to login even after many attempts tried all ways now going to uninstall ....worst ....time waste....ðŸ˜¡,0
"This has got to be the best music/podcast app out there. All of my music and podcasts are right there, I don't have the premium because I have data, but I absolutely love it. Way better than Pandora. I want Premium.",1
On Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra buggy af. God damn this app sucks. Please fix it all the way.,0
"Spotify won't let me listen to individual songs with out buying the premium version, they also add random things to my Playlist that I don't want to listen too.",0
"Used to be a great app now its too many ads , and what's the purpose of making my Playlist if you're gonna add all these songs I can't stand and play them for me instead of my Playlist.....",0
Its a good app and premium is awesome but the past few days I haven't been able to go back or forward songs. It also hasn't been showing the present song playing. If I didn't have these problems it would be 5 star.,0
"The app randomly changes permissions on my phone. Everytime I restart my phone, I have to re-download my whole library",0
the app is very good for music but if you dont have premiem things are very limeted otherwise very good,1
I give four stars bcz soo many adds in spotify but I also lv this app if adds will not come after every song,0
Love this app! I finally select & listen to what I like.,1
The app is great. The experience so far has been top notch. Keep it up Spotify!,1
Has the best podcasts on planet earth. Can't get enough of the variety and open debate. Also their recommended music ai is second to none. Great work,0
"Just started using Spotify, everything works. Good music choices. Perfect!!",1
Good ,1
"It's very good and has 100% helped me during meltdowns to calm down. Other than small issues, it's decent. I can't change the playback volume anymore. 3 stars",1

I can't skip songs and I can't reverse ðŸ™„,1
A very reliable App. Helps me find the gospel songs quickly and contains songs i would not be able to find easily usibg other Apps. Thankyou Sporify.,1
Spotify is literally the best streaming music service right now. My only suggestion would be start offering High fidelity quality inn songs. Of love this function were added,1
"I'm not sure what happened recently. I have play lists that are supposed to last a few hours, but Spotify seems to be repeating the same 10 songs over and over again.",0
When we get logged out the downloads gets removed :((((((,0
"I am having some trouble play some podcast. Update I am having less problems with a podcast that I have been listening too for a few days. The customer service person was very helpful, was very understanding and very patient with me. I will do another update in a month or so. We'll see if I give it 5 stars or not.",1
The experience is Very very good Just sick of adds ðŸ˜„,1
"I despise this app. It's like you took all the features from all the music apps, separated them out into good and bad and then made an app out of all the bad features. I would not dream of paying the subscription because the free version is so heinous. I am literally only on this app because of Joe Rogan and a Japanese band that I can't find their music on any other app. If these two leave I will delete this app with glee.",0
It's been amazing I love it keep it up,1
It plays every song I could ever imagine having to think of and it is very useful,1
"Really like this app for music, but I'm sad that you can't download single songs from off of an album. You used to be able to do that, but with one of the later updates that changed. Please bring that option back.",0
Terrible experience on mobile.,0
"ARTISTS AS WELL AS PAYING CUSTOMERS SHOULD DEMAND TRANSPARENCY OF THIS COMPANY THEY ARE RIPPING OFF THE ARTISTS & THE PAYING CUSTOMERS THAT PAY TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC THEY WANT TO LISTEN TO NOT SOMEONE SHOVED DOWN,THIER THROATS THAT IS PAYOLA,ALSO FOR ARTIST THAT WONT PLAY THIER GAME THEY GET PENALUZED BECAUSE THE STREAMS GET RATIOED MORE THAN OTHERS,AS WELL AS PEOPLE HAVE EXPOSE RHE GLENDIVE STREAMING FARM,THEY NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED,ITS NOT AS BAD A RADIO YET,BUT THEY GOT EXPOSEðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ",0
It's Good App Cx it has no adds and we can make our own playlists as well it's pretty fun,1
"It doesn't open anymore at all. On Android 6.0, before it worked, then again not. Every 2nd update it just crashes ""Spotify has stopped"" notification - before it opens. Can't use it at all.",0
"Keeps pushing podcasts with no option to hide them, and repeatedly prompting for access to Bluetooth devices every session with no option to not ask again. I am on a paid plan too.",0
I absolutely love that I can create a Playlist that I can download and listen to my favorite music when I am on a plane.,1
Very useful app fo music lovers,1
I like music ,1
It's nice to listen to music while I sleep especially since I have premium because I don't have ads,1
"Earlier I like this app but now they are forcing to listen music according to them in their pre-made play list. If I don't like the song I can change them only 6 times In a hour ,can't listen to previous song n many more for non paid app user. So I switched to other app.",0
App is nice only if you have premium membership otherwise you will be irritated by adds,0
"Just download the app and it's great , it doesn't use a lot of data. I can't just find the download button.",1
Absolutely enjoy the amount of content I can listen to. Just wish Garth Brooks was accessible.,1
"This is the best Music App ever. All of my favorite songs are on this App. I go to bed listening to Spotify, it helps me when I'm feeling down and when I'm feeling up. Thank you God for Spotify it's been a God send. Blessings to you all.",1
"Good all over but 3 star because many more ads,very irritating ðŸ‘ðŸ»",0
Very fantastic app for your favorite songs,1
"Who is the idiot that designate advertisement every two songs, and also advertisement after EACH Baby song of less than 5 mins needs to be sacked. What happened to that thirty minutes uninterrupted music? Disappointing",0
Worst update ever. My spotify is always reseting. Can't listen to my Playlists and crashes and plays from the beginning ðŸ˜ª,0
Went on a road trip and downloaded a bunch of music to find out that it did not show up when I lost service:(,0
"Everything is good, the app is working fine and do the work as intended. Spotify been the best music app since forever!",1
"Easy to use, plays in the background unlike YouTube. They also have my favorite podcasts that are no longer on pandora.",0
"Suddenly the app bugs and I get lost for wanting to use the most BASIC features (find the player, unblock a song etc...). I have to restart the app to find it again.. not expecting that form the biggest music streaming app",0
Why can't I play my downloaded songs offline. My plan with Spotify says otherwise. I don't pay monthly fees for nothing. Please fix this issue.,0
This is very good ,1
Best music streaming service out there!,1
"The most recent update has given me the same issues as everyone else, random stops, no queue, no controls. Reached out to support, they told me to reinstall. Not very helpful. Everything was fine prior to this update",0
Finally I can listen to music published by my talented family around the world!,1
"Spotify is the glitchiest app on my phone - it turns itself off mid-song, and needs resetting all the time because the interface malfunctions. And I pay for it every month!",0
"As the user below mentioned, on S22 ultra the playback panel constantly disappears and only comes back after restarting my phone. Sometimes the app continues to play even after it's been closed and also needs a restart to fix.",0
Best music platform I've used. Thats not saying much tho. The only thing I hate is one cant thumbs DOWN a song to remove it quickly. Wish they would add that,0
"I used to like this app but the player window (the interface you use to play, pause, switch tracks, etc.) disappears. I've tried closing and reopening it and rebooting my phone. Sometimes it brings it back and sometimes it does. Please fix!",0
Really like being able to select my songs,1
"It was all good not until the new update where you cannot shuffle your playlist. As someone who is too indecisive this new update is hard for me. Please put it back, thank you.",0
The Playlist suggestions are always so on point I've discovered so many new artist I love.,1
"If we're talking about the phone app, it's a bummer. It's hard to use and most of the times it doesn't even play the songs I chose to play. I don't hate Spotify itself, because the application in my laptop works perfectly fine. I just wished it was easier to manage.",0
I appreciate that your podcasts and music are open to all genres? and open to all interests?,1
It's nice I acc lyk it a lot but I just don't lyk the fact that without premium u can't listen to any song we want,0
"If you hear music while gaming,this is the best choice for you",1
love spotify best music app been with it since my first black cat 2017,1
It has all my favorite music on it for a decent price. And I love how they have podcasts. I listen to a nature sound one to go to bed.,1
They are taking 15.99 out of account every month and I am not on the premium!,0
great music quality,1
If choose my fav song but it's another song-,0
"A lot of Ads, had like 6 ads, plus whenever I have the app open and I don't listen to music and play music again, I'm unable to skip the songs and says ""Spotify is trying to play..."" with wireless earbuds.",1
I've had to install this app so I can listen to Joe Rogan. He doesn't seem to be on the other apps. Feb '22,0
Versitile and diverse. I love it for all the great music from my era.,1
The best music application there is.,1
"Love Spotify, had it for years. Like the fact it'll find tunes similar to my musical tastes so it introduces me to artists I would likely never have found. Playlists are easy to create, podcasts are easy too, what's not to like.",0
"The best,needs to improve on making sure that every song's lyrics are available thou",0
Recently updated version forcing me to remove this file from my phone. Thanks Spotify Bye Bye,0
"I love all the music in here, and had a lot of choices. And i always subcribe to the premium so i can download the song that i want.",1
Easy to navigate. Not too many ads.,1
"Very annoying app for the Android version. Yes, I am using the free version, but it does not mean I cannot back track a playlist, only giving forward/next track option. Cruel thing you have got. I still prefer the PC version. And if you like get the Windows version spoilt too.",0
"Hey spotify, i can't express how I'm in love with spotify but still you can add features like 10sec seek time but double tapping the album posters on both the sides. And also change the widget UI.",0
This app is throughly irritating. I have to constantly Uninstall and reinstall so it just just skip around genres. And now it is crashing.,0
Very nice for audio songs,1
"Keeps pausing on it's own every couple of seconds for no god damn reason. If I could just scroll from the top of my screen and press the play button I wouldn't mind, but I have to enter the app again to press play just for it to pause again.",0
Nice listening to wonderful music!,1
"What the fk is happening? Occasionally pauses, sometimes turn the volume up without any contact with my phone, that lies comfortably in my pocket! Why????? This is getting too anoying! update 17 06 22: it wasn't the app, but 3,5mm connector in my phone all great now",0
It's good but not able to find some of the desired songs.,0
love this app will listen for hours,1
When you change country it's will ask you so many things..to change country .it should update like other apps,0
"One of the great apps for those who are good listeners, interested in music and songs.",1
Chronicly unable to cope with occasional loss of internet. As if app forgets daily to download my songs. I don't want to be Spotifys network admin.,0
They had a good platform but now they use it to sensor people they don't politically disagree with,1
Video never works. Always crashes and just doesn't work properly. My podcast will cut out and start over randomly. I love when it randomly loses my place and what I'm listening to and plays something else. Boggles my mind that people actually pay monthly for this app,0
"I love Spotify... For the most part. The only downfall, in my opinion, is the fact that Spotify on Android Auto is missing some features. Please add the ability to queue songs on Android auto (through voice commands, and a button on the screen), and please also add the ability to search for songs (using an on screen keyboard, not only voice commands).",0
Think it's better on iOS but I still enjoy Spotify on either OS,1
Worst app sometimes which I was listening won't come particularlly that podcast not opens please fix the bloody bug Spotify...........,0
"website is awesome, app is caca. you would get more money out of me if you actually let me choose songs for free, even if i had to watch an ad once or even twice everytime a song played. i would at least be using the app instead of keeping it for the sole reason of adding a new song to my liked songs when i'm away from my computer.",1
"I love the app, but it would be really fun if there was a drag and drop functionality between playlists in the desktop app. I know that's hard or maybe not possible to implement, just a thought.",0
"They say ""watch this short video to get 30 mins of uninterrupted music"" and then after watching it the start giving ads after 2 to 3 songs i.e 10mins atleast.....when we put songs in queue they literally give 2 ads after every freaking single song.... the ad algorithm of YouTube is far better than Spotify..... it's better if we start listening for free on Jio savaan with less ads and no membership or take membership of YouTube (YouTube premium)..... Spotify is becoming the worst app for music..",0
"""Now playing bar"" will not disappear from locked screen when I try to swipe it away. Notification stays in screen, sucking battery. How is that an improvement???",0
Too many ad's,0
"Great when subscribed to Premium, but my favorite part of Spotify is the Dumb Blonde Podcast by Bunnie (Jelly Roll's amazing and beautiful wife).",1
"I love this app, but why do I always experience issues with it?? First I was not able to see the lyrics feature and now I can't share songs on my Instagram storiesðŸ˜­",0
Have issues finding a song I'm currently playing so can't shut it off. I've had to uninstall Spotify three times now in a week just to turn off a song. I'm on premium subscription. It used to be a really good app. Using with Samsung.,0
It's Hella good can play in the background has no bugs i use it like 24 7,1
Perfect for all my music and Podcasts,1
I love the Spotify app. Especially the lyrics feature...I can sing along!,1
I play music on my pc. And set pc playback on mobile to. It still doesn't change songs on pc. Lags a lot. Makes it annoying. Please fix it.,0
"Love Spotify, I can find pretty much almost anything... There are some songs that I can't find but on the whole I love this app, easy to figure out and use. Can't say anything bad about it really â˜ºï¸",1
Excellent sound-easy-to-use app,1
"Far too many ads, basic things that should be free such as playing a singular song you want to listen to. You have to pay for",0
"Sucks after not having premium. I get ads between every song, not aloud to skip over 6 times per hour, won't let me listen to songs that I made favorite, puts random songs into the album I listen to, the list goes on and on. Hope this let you know to not download it.",0
Spotify has always been great until lately. I play my music and it cuts out all the time halfway through the song. I pay premium also so why is this happening.,0
Please share with me how do I access changing my password since it is forgotten I can't listen to Spotify on my TV only this cell phone if I can't access updating my password I will be taking this off my phone for permanent I'm not going to join if I can't access and listen,0
"I like this app I can play any music on it, but now whenever I try to press on one song it just plays another one and it's so annoying because it takes like 3 minutes to get the song I want to play.",0
"Starts and stops playing by itself on pixel 5, Android 12.1.",0
User friendly and large selection of music for everyone at a fair price.,1
I like being able to mark my favorite selections.,1
"Really enjoy using Spotify, but other services have better quality audio. I feel like Spotify has a better algorithm for discovering new songs and has a better social aspect when compared to other services.",0
Very good app but so many ads,1
"Love the service but I hate the app! I am waiting for minutes to play even downloaded podcasts to the point that phone just shuts app or I just give up waiting ! Playing stops randomly , I am listening to advertising even after paying membership. After every update I am hoping it gets fixed but it never does...",0
"Great music, very clear. No b.s.",0
"I'm disappointed, i only downloaded it foe today so i can listen to songs that i like but there is a lot of stupid playlist that doesn't even make sense at all. I'm trying to listen to ONE SONG BUT IT DOESN'T LET ME, I wish i can rate this 0. The quality of the sound sounds horrible like a buzzkill",0
Easy enough to navigate and use,1
"Edit April 2022: there is a really annoying glitch right now on pixel 4a5g where the pause/play menu does not show up, requiring the app to be closed. Rating changed to 4 stars until fixed. This is my favorite music app, I use it for pop, rock, and even Anime openings. My one complaint is that there are some songs that appear available, but are greyed out and blocked.",0
As a premium user this is purely waste of money. Note 10plus User. Lags is what this app offers.,0
"I'm listening, but the app tell me nothing is playing. That inteferes with interaction.",0
Amazing plain and simple,1
It's not working songs lyrics with mobile device : (,0
Too many ads Spotify old varson is good,1
"Best app out there for discovering new artists and listening to music across decades. Ive rarely looked up a band and been disappointed to find no files. That being said, I like my music platform like I like my morning coffee, apolitical. If the he said/she said popularity contest of cultural correctness is going to influence the breadth of media thats allowed to be enjoyed we might as well say goodbye to the ""free art"" movement. Bring back Alex Jones. AND PLZ FIX BLUETOOTH.",0
"I dont really have that much issues tbh. i wish it wouldnt constantly remove asongor 2 from my mix,but thats about it.",0
I like Spotify vary much but I can't listen to playlists without not having to have it on shuffle. Can you please fix this?,1
Really good app in my opinion huge variety of music and a lot of really cool artists!!,1
Best package,1
App doesn't work while connected to Wifi. I also had issues signing in. Not sure if these are only related to my phone,0
Why I can't purchase??? don't you want my account to be premium? please fix it!,0
Podcasts and audiobooks a welcome addition,1
"Edit: as of June 13, 2022, there have been two more updates, and now nothing will download. If this isn't resolved soon, I will cancel my premium account and go to Amazon Music. Spotify has been great up until recently. As of the beginning of June 2022, podcasts have not been downloading for me, nor will they show up under the section ""Your Episodes."" I have updated the app on June 7, 2022, and still have these issues.",0
Only ads ....no music....,0
glad they fixed that app compared from last years app,0
"It was good when I first got it, I could skip and go back but now my skips are limited and I can restart it. Im not paying to skip and choose a song. I'm going to a different app",0
"Had this app for 5 plus years but almost to the point of deleting, it crashes when i skip to the next song, and i pay monthly to be able to listen anywhere and theres still times it says its unable to play my music when im in the middle of no where..",0
very good,1
My wifi and data are fine but Spotify has been choppy loading songs lately and stops intermittently. Other people seem to be having this problem too. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. No help.,0
I cant continue with Google because I uninstalled the app with the other account I tried the same Google account and it won't work I hate this alot fix this,0
It suddenly stop playing my fav playlist. And i have to listen it again from top list. Plus it cant be shuffle :),1
"At first dis app was okay but no more.I advice d developer to go back to d former arrangement of songs in d playlist not whatever this new one is. I can't even select a song to be played because it ends up playing only d chorus and stops after dat...it's infuriating.I can only play a full song if I click on the play button at the top of the playlist and dat may not b d song I even want to listen toooooo,so I will have to patiently press next till I get to d song I want?I don't think so.",0
I enjoy the selection and the podcasts as a truck driver I listen a lot. The bad score is because I can't turn off autoplay. As soon as my phone connects the app turns on and starts playing and I will end up deleting the app if not fixed.,0
It wont let me update and when i search for a song it only plays the chorus,0
Actually the pc version is good you can atleast select between the songs in your playlist and in this app you can't even do that and when i play my playlist it automatically selects shuffle and sometimes it just playes a songs that is not even in my playlist a rubbish app deleting it.,0
Superb songs collections and useful app for all,1
I hate the updated spotify cause I can't choose what music I want to play it just randomly pick it's own I hate this,0
Almost free music. . .perfect. Plus not authoritarian bull s#@t.,1
"I rather use pandora, Spotify skips and stops playing. Really unhappy with it.",0
"I cannot revert my hidden songs in my playlist, find a fix for this!",0
"Excellent quality of music, great range, easy to use, streams well on soundboard",1
Wow,1
Best music recommendations platform on earth. You can just play one of your favorite songs on it and songs that follow after that are going to be even better and you end adding at least 10 new songs to your playlist... that's how good the spotify recommendations are!!,1
Latest update has me having to close completely out of app to show what song is playing and/or show controls. Was perfect until now ðŸ‘Ž Will update review after problem is fixed.,0
Clear sounds. No issues.,1
Have used this app for years very good quality. Could use more new ways to find new music.,0
"Best, but need to work on bass clarity in some songs",0
Just the best app to listen to music.,1
Easy to use wish there was a shuffle to make it more random like YouTube is but I can have my phone off so it evens out,0
"It's awesome ,but too much ads interupt",0
I love the app but please try to fix this one thing i can't play the song i actually want in my playlist and also the limit,0
"Randomly stops, plays other episodes Randomly, just a horrible platform for listening to podcasts. I cannot count how many times I have to re open spotify to pick up where I left off because it stopped. Then it will start all over again. Just bad. I don't get how you guys have such high rating when this is the experience",0
Used to be best features in it but now they are all gone Hope to see these features to come back again,1
Way too many ads. Very very limited skips. Basically they do every possible annoying interruptions to get you to try purchase premium.,0
"Bad controls, cant even turn off shuffle, cant turn on repeat, cant even play a song. whats next pay premium just to open the app. You just wanted money, you didnt care about the community, you just milk for bucks and heartless",0
"Slowly this app is becoming useless, it is free, so what if there is a limit for ads too?",0
"Don't even bother with the app. You can put 2 songs in a playlist and because of the stupid shuffle, you can't even listen to the two songs! Instead you have to buy premium just to listen to the songs that were suppose to be in your playlist. You might aswell buy iTunes or Google music.",0
Every time I get a new phone. I have to reapply for a new service. I hope I don't get a double bill.,0
I been really happy with this app it's the best one that I've found so far,1
I love the Spotify service it gives me my choice of any song or album I want to play and I just love it keep up the great work,1
Its great love it only not 5 stars because sometimes you cant play certain songs on some devices im not sure why but i love spotify even with that problem im gonna forever be a premium user,1
"I dont know what the matter is, but this app, it doesn't want to download at all...trust me my storage space is enough for apps twice the size of mb of spotify idk why it doesnt want to download but I've been trying to download it for the past 5days!!!",0
"I love this Apps,given that I can listen to any type of music at any given time. It's fantastic!",1
"I love spotify and have used it for as long as I can remember, but I hate not being able too chose a song without shuffling. It mamkes it frustrating and sucks when im really in the mood for a specific song. Please fix this. Then many other people and I will give 5 stars.",0
This app spoils you with good music. Some songs you forgot about and you also discover new ones you will love forever.,1
"Even i have subscribe for a years, lyrics won't showed up, fix this!!",0
Very new to Spotify but have heard wo wonderful things about the app.,1
I have no words it's just so amazing âœ¨ â¤ ðŸ’–,1
I love Apostle Jennifer LeClaire's Podcasts . They are so helpful and timely. The Prayer Watrriors Podcast ( Episode 001 ) provides insight for intercessors into the times in which we live . This episode offers Prayer points on 'what and how to pray' against a food crises .,1
Bottom row with Play / Pause buttons randomly dissappears and the only way to get them back is by restarting the app.,0
"The most used app in my phone, it always improves.",1
New update has removed Now Playing bar so cannot skip tracks. Hopefully an update will be sorted soon to correct this!!,0
I can listen to everything kind of music at anytime,1
Its good but i wish it was ofline music like audiomac,0
Yesterday when I clicked on a song suddenly 6 ads continued please fix it. A suggestion is that please add Google Play purchasing option for paying from Google Play balance because I have money in Google Play Balance. Please hear my request.,0
Just freeze on the splash screen on my one plus 7t,0
Always really liked the app. But now the controll bar with the play/pause button is suddenly gone. Highly frustrating.,0
Filtering of podcasts and sorting seem to be lumped together making finding unplanned episodes in date order difficult and having to redo it every time I open app,0
Love Spotify. It works great in my car and with Alexa at home.,1
"Does exactly what it says and is easy to use and excellent to share playlist with with friends, family too ðŸ‘",1
Love straight music when ads are fun and interesting that is cool ðŸ˜Ž,1
its a good app icl but its annoying when spotify adds songs to your playlist. like im trying to listen to my own music tyvm???,0
It keeps adding songs that I don't like to my playlists,0
"Good app, I just wish I could play my Playlist to the end without going to another group song not on my list. Also give me an option to get the premium without my credit card. Give a free month then start charging.",1
"Still the best one so far. The bad thing is that when you install, could suggest better music from Brazil, like classic MPB (Vinicius, Tom, Toqunho, Miucha, Chico, etc).",0
It crashes & resets podcasts often. Also it sometimes won't show the progress bar & you need to reinstall the app. I'm between 3 & 4 stars.,0
"Excellent quality overall! I very much appreciate that a person can close the app and still have the music playing. Also, WIDE VARIETY OF GENRES! Anything you can think of!",1
Took it down to 4 stars cause you can't turn off shuffle anymore ðŸ˜• EDIT: nevermind they just moved it.You have to go to the three dots in the upper right corner after you go to the current song.,0
"Stops playing every ten minutes +/- I love to listen to my podcasts while driving is during my train commute, but the recent update constantly interrupts playback, so I'll uninstall for now. It's a brilliant app otherwise.",1
Lately the Spotify app has been very buggy. The controls disappear with the music track stopping and starting. Hopefully the app gets updated asap.,0
Every time I get an add it says watch this add to get 30 mins of add free music I press no and it gives me like 4 adds! I'm dissatisfied.,0
"The 3 stars are for the service Spotify provides (daily mixes, blends, radios etc) but honestly the android app has been quite horrible lately, lagging all the time, there's always a delay between what im listening to and whats displayed, recently i can't even open the app it would stay at the HP with the spotify logo it's frustrating",0
"Love this,except when y'all got too big,you had toake us pay,when it was free..no ads,no premium..but I understand it just sucks",0
A very good app,1
Love to listen to my favorite music,1
Spotify is the best podcast,1
"Once a year in try Spotify out again when they have a deal, and it just seems to get more bloated and slow every time. The UI is annoying and buggy. It constantly lags out and crashes. They make it hard to control your queue. I have NONE of these problems with YouTube Music. Not sure what's going on over at Spotify but it feels like they just keep injecting new features into a broken app instead of fixing the fundamental issues.",0
"I've used Spotify for years, but am rethinking that due to their standing by Joe Rogan and the horrible people he brings to his show and the lies and misinformation that is generated from that. I be reevaluating other competitors products.",0
I give 5 because search level of songs is brilliant ðŸ‘ keep it up and every song is available here great spotify,1
Very easy to use and handy when ant got any data,1
"Has ads. Sometimes they get too much. But it is very easy to use and has all my favourite songs. A thing that I love is, if I don't remember the name of song, I simply search the lyrics and the song shows up. Also, I love the personalized playlists",1
They changed the now playing back thank God!! Old review: Why change the now playing page UI and take away the lyrics button? What backwards A/B testing is this???,0
"20220629 Update... still sucks. Have to unistiall, reinstall app often. Stops playing very frequently, can't use lock screen controls.",0
"Something happened recently where I would play a song from a one of my playlists on Spotify then it would loop the same 3 songs over and over, instead of the just playing the entire playlist. I discovered when I play a playlist it adds the current song and the remainder of the playlist to the queue but not always. Don't know why a playlist needs to be added to a queue it's already a queue/list, seems redundant. I do see the need but I would like an option to turn off the queue feature.",0
"The music available is awesome,I have no need or desire to listen to the Podcast selection. If I could find another alternative to this(Spotify), without the annoying Podcast,I'd do it in a heartbeat.",1
I just love it the made for you and my favorites I already recommend it to my friends and family,1
Its been great. There is another feature I'd like to see. I have tried to contact corporate to pitch my idea with no success.,0
Always plays songs after my playlist even though I turn it off,1
What happened to the shuffle feature? That big button at the top was ideal.,1
Been using Spotify since it launched in AUS back in 2012 and haven't needed to use another music streaming service since. It really is the best music streaming service by far!,1
Pls give back the old Spotify menu I can't even play the sounds that I want to play.,0
Good selection of tracks,1
Having trouble finding a couple of albums otherwise great how do you like my playlist,1
Works well. Good access to lots of podcasts.,1
"I don't spend money on apps, but I will for Spotify",1
Best music app. Got even better with the swipe to ad queue function. Love it!,1
All are fine we can play in baground but ads we cant skip ads that's the big problem,0
Excellent range of music and artists.,1
"After the last update, it constantly stops playing music and doesn't show the app bar in notifications.",0
Best app ever ever has all the songs can even set a sleep timer so when you fall of to sleep it gose off Everyone that come on this app its a must downloaded 100 ,1
"I use Spotify every day but recently the app is frustrating. When listening, very often the app the UI doesn't show any music is playing so I have no way to pause, play or change song via the phone (android). There isn't even a bar on the lock screen. The shuffle functionality quite simple doesn't work as it should. When I shuffle my songs I get the same songs played to me, but also repeated. Maybe they're trying to be too smart and playing songs they know you like. Let me make that decision",0
I use it all the time for my music. I loved it without premium but I love it even more now that I don't have any ads and can choose which song to listen to!,1
Overall nice app but download option for songs should be there without premium,0
"So every week on my release radar, spotify keeps putting a random artist from a genre that i never listen to, but the song has one of bands i listen a lot tagged as a associated artist even though they aren't. For example the song: ""UTOPIA-Abridged"" by Harper Minta, Aer, Blu, and the odd ball Avatar. Which is a swedish heavy-death metal band...",1
"Best Music App ever developed. If you can't find a on it , it hasn't been released yet and the sound quality is magnificent. The other apps are trying but Spotify is miles ahead of them. They get all the latest music the day the artist releases it. I've been a premium member for many years now.ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘",1
This stupid app keeps turning itself off in the middle of listening to something and sometimes won't go to the next episode of a podcast.,0
A lot of music to listen and well listed to,1
I really like this app find all my favorite podcast and music.,1
Love app,1
"Best music listening app to me, have been listening with premium for two years and can say the premium is worth it. I am fully satisfied with quality of the song they provide, and of course I get to download the music so it very convenient in no network areas. There enhance option has given so many new favs and I really love it",1
"I'll stay a paying customer as long as you keep Joe Rogan. You cancel him, we cancel you. Revised 5-1-2022 what's up Spotify? It keeps closing multiple times during songs. I'm a paying customer.",0
Got duo premium plan and Spotify deactivated my account 3 times after receiving payment for premium commercial free services. Customer support is a joke they can't call you to resolve a problem only via their text messaging services so after a 3rd disabled account I am ridding myself of this joke of a music streaming service putting music from their views as to what I might like to listen too often interrupting my set playlists from bands I do not like over 5ge music I prefer. It is just listen,0
Way to many ads. I always use YouTube music but trying playing a song link to Spotify. I watch probably 10 ads for 3 minutes and the song still didn't come on. Trash.,0
Spotify is Second to none!,0
"Third class as. As when you click on a like song, Spotify removing sogs and try to force to buy premium membership. Useless app now.",0
"Extremely happy......and a suggestion, to smoother the transition between two songs in a queue...... basically to make the time interval between two songs in a queue next to zero.........Otherwise very happy with Spotify......good experience",1
It's great to be able to listen to a album of my choice,1
j'adore. but like can you just let us see the lyrics on all songs & less ads please ðŸ™,0
App has been downloading songs everytime my phone resets and has been constantly shutting down or resetting for quite some time now. I has become a nuisance to use and overall It's ridiculous that an app this massive has these issues.,0
"your suggested songs SUCKASS. why would there be an indian songs in a metal gear rising ost playlist?? at least make it make sense with suggesting other games' ost or any other metal music, really. plus the suggested songs CLOGGED the playlist so much. 2/3 songs that is played is suggested songs and i wasted 6 free skips in only 10 minutes. if this is done to drive me to pay a subscription for premium, sorry it wont work. im just gonna NOT upgrade it out of spite",0
Cant login. Says too many attempts will not allow me to reset password. Worthless. Was going premium,0
"give us the option back of alphabetical order for the playlists, it now takes me forever to find the playlist i want... would be 5 stars if that issue gets fixed very soon",0
Its a nice app but the app is like a beggar always telling me to buy premium and shows ad after every 3 musics,0
This app thinks it knows what I want to hear other than my liked songs. I will choose because the app doesn't know diddly squat. Nice try Spotify. You don't know me you creep. Just play what I tell you to play.,0
"In recently played, it is not showing my playlist that i have played like it use too. It is showing the songs but not the playlist it was played from. There was a option to allow playlist to be modified by other collaborators but that option is now gone. Also please work on your block artists option. Still getting songs recommended to me by artists that I have block.",0
Great app. At least for unsigned musicians like myself,1
"Spotify is a great app; a one stop shop for good music with inbuilt lyrics to help anyone sing along. My issue however, the personalized playlist should be more flexible. People should be able to play a particular song at will instead of the shuffle play.",0
I love that I can get access to a lot of music to download. Music I would have never heard of before but I love now. I can download these songs to listen to it later. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€,1
I love songs,1
Latest update was nice and user friendly and keep going ,1
"Let me shuffle my playlist, other than that it's good.",0
"Spotify fixâ¹ your bugs and glitches! I love this app, but lately I've to uninstall and reinstall the app multiple times. But the songs still shuffle randomly, the song will play for about 18s then stop playing sound while the song is still going on. I go to skip a song and it will go forward and couple songs then go back songs. I cant play what I want.",0
I do love this app is go listen to very good music and more to.,1
I want to download other songs but it keeps on declining but hey it is a very good app,1
I love Spotify it's awesome it's like YouTube I would give them both 10 star's I just got into Spotify & I can't get enough of it I really enjoy listening to Jerry Cantrell's new music!!,1
"Don't ever search something unless you want to see it every day for the rest of your time on the app. I searched Joni Mitchell one time, hopefully seeing all her trash music removed, and now I see her face everytime I open the app. Like Fullscreen pic of her. After contacting customer service the only option is creating a new account. I'll just pirate you stuff on the internet",0
Absolutely great experience. The recommendations are crazy.ðŸ˜ Great volume. Great Daily Mixes. My absolute favorite music app. Nothing beats Spotify. Worth every dime I could ever spend.,1
"I've had a family subscription to Spotify (and Pandora) for years. Due to this company choosing misinformation over music, I'll be cancelling as soon as they re-open their customer service lines. Evidently, I'm not the only one that feels this way. It's sad this company would choose profits over democracy- they'll no longer get my money.",0
This is the best music app. Stress buster. Best mind relief. I love this app,1
My all time music app,1
If you know you know,1
this is best music app & i really like this application,1
Love making my own playlists.,1
It's an awesome app. Really like & enjoy it,1
Really i love very much Spotify i feel the song everytime through Spotify searching option is amazing thank you so much Spotify to provide mind free songs from all languages,1
"Not remotely impressed. Downloads dissappear. Podcasts I have downloaded will abruptly end and will show as ""played"" so I have to find out where I was on a 4 hour podcast. Good job everyone ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡",0
Good music application,1
Good for free streaming of music. You'll need premium to create playlists of you're own.,0
"Theres a problem with the canvas with my version of the app. Even though my android is up to date and the spotify app too, I cant seem to find the canvas option in my account settings. It's been like this since 2021 so please fix this bug as soon as possible",0
Can't play whatever I want it only plays on shuffle playlists:/,0
"Music catalogue is 5-star. App has got less slow but could be much better. It now hangs when history icon tapped. Don't like that Shuffle is now turned on when trying to play Release Radar etc in order. Sorting a playlist (hidden by an unituitive down-drag not in the menu as it used to be) by 'recently added' sorts the wrong way unless you tap it twice. Been like that for ages. Poor design and testing. Could be improved with freq. used buttons, eg 'Add To Queue', 'Add To Playlist'",0
Awesome music to kickback & vibe with when your all stressed out and feel like your falling on deaf ears (As you can't argue with Stupud) just saying..lol,1
Worst experience ever using musical apps this app provides a lot of adds in every single song finally a journey of an 1yr comes to an end in one night bcz of hearing a adds in every single song....,0
Song i would rate this a 4 becuse when i try to play a song it puts a diffrent song on and my settings are default but these song are good so 5,1
awsome you have the best music. But you have to many adds,1
I love every aspect of this app!,1
"The slowest app on my phone, by a large margin. Have tried signing in and out, uninstalling and reinstalling, turning phone on and off, clearing cache and data, everything. This app doesn't run, it saunters with a cane. Also, no way to disable annoying podcasts...NO I WONT LISTEN TO BRO JOGAN",0
NICE,1
Love Spotify. Its the only way I listen to music any more- and the Duomix/blend is perfect for my husband and I when we can't agree. Amazing.,1
great app! got premium! wouldn't be very good without it! love it use it loads! totally recommend! really easy to use!,1
"It's so very easy and simple to get the songs you want, easy to make playlist as well. I don't mind using data listening to good music.",1
"Can't get group listen to work no matter what I try, tried double sign out and in again, clearing cache, different ways to invite people the lot fs",0
"It's a exceptionally good music app. I absolutely love it. Though I have a suggestion. The thing is when ever I want to download a song, i have to add it to a playlist then I can download it. But in Amazon music i cand download it and it automatically getta added to aplaylist of its own .",1
You're app keeps stopping/crashing on my phone. The song that's playing doesn't come up anywhere and then it stops mid song 10 minutes later...,0
I love my music I play on Spotify.,1
"With the latest update, I have to restart app so I can pause or skip music currently being played. This option dissappears for some odd reason. Please fix.",0
"I live with it every day. Spotify is a blessing for artists and content creators everywhere. If you don't appreciate the platform that provides unlimited access to your content, your crazy.",1
"Love the music app, easy to use",1
Is the best music keep it up,1
This app is so good....love it...this app is very good for kpop song..ðŸ’œ,1
Amazing,1
The best app to listen to your songs,1
I like ,1
Perfect music and podcasts,1
"4 stare because of the frequent ads. ""Get premium!"" I am, but its still annoying and im gonna complain so shut up.",0
I love the app its just the adds and the 6 skips per hour i just dont wana listen to that song thia one time dang,1
"This app is super amazing ,I found many new good songs. I like it ðŸ˜Š",1
Easy and efficient to use,1
Cancelling my subscription. Whenever I play a song it closes! I never had this experience before.,0
Good app tho but whhen im on computer i can pick anything but when im on phone i can only shuffle,0
Most Lovely app because podcast   but premium version is high rate money ,1
"I can't use the lyrics sharing feature? I have deleted and installed the application many times, updated it, logged out of the account and logged in again, but it still does not have the ability to share lyrics. There is a place to share lyrics but there is no share button. That's why I took a star off. I hope officials answer this.",0
I normally love Spotify and have used it for years but this last update has made the app awful. It keeps losing the bar to control your music and I have to close the entire app just to get it to stop playing,0
I loved this app until it completely stopped working for me. It won't open at all and I get a app is not responding message,0
Only problem is a ton of ads ðŸ’€,0
"always liked this app simply for it's tenach ... times faster & choice matchups... it doesn't get my old list I'd shared 5yrs ago w my late husband but I'll say 2 great features ... more play time and speed. ... burns less data than any other I know... I love my YouTube's* for downloads are permanently locked [hard to find ems and I locked em] but I share more easly to my sweethearts as a ""convo, gift, thinking of ya*",1
I not happy with the way you can't skip as meny times as you want without paying,0
I Hate the Ads in between but it is good.,1
"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! You can download any music or just listen with your mobile data on the go, what else can you ask more...",0
"Imo Spotify is the best music app compared to others. I've found artists on here that i was unable to find on other apps. The app is user friendly and has a lot of extras like an equalizer, car mode, etc.",1
Used Spotify since it was still in beta and free tehe Always loved it Listening several hours daily I also really like the small extra things like Discover Weekly and the yearly Wrapped etc,1
This is grate for my health I listen to music every night x thank you ðŸ˜Š ðŸ™ you are the ðŸ‘ i love you ( not in that way as in i love your app) x,1
There are a lot of ads. I am at the position of deleting this app. Otherwise it's ok.,1
It's good to get all kind of song from all over the world in one place and music quality is good.,1
Love the app and use it all the time!!!,1
Why my Spotify is been stopped. After opening the app after selecting the song apps gets closed automatically.,0
Some new songs are not there and Lots of ads are irritative,0
I like Spotify but have had some issues with it crashing. I pay for premium but feel it's a bit expensive for one person.,0
"Liar liar pants on fire. ""watch this commercial for thirty minutes of uninterrupted music"" Fifteen minutes later the music is interrupted by commercial. Every time! Choose a song, press play and it plays some other song. Every time! Notifications blocked, still shows notifications.",0
"My rating is specific to this version of the app (8.7.20.1261), and is driven by the well-documented issue you can find if you search Spotify's forums for ""Now Playing bar missing on Android.""",0
Awesome app! My experience with Spotify has been great. I found virtually all my favorite oldies and some new ones too. The auto Playlists are amazing.,1
"Very user friendly. One of my FAVORITE things is how you can create a radio based off of a Playlist you've created, or a song, artist, album...I'm a huge music junkie and have found so much new music through spotify. 100% worth paying for premium. You can download songs/playlists, so even if you don't have signal, you can still listen.",0
"Extra-ordinary, extraordinary ready when I'm ready letting me explore the Stars like Observatory",1
Cant log in with my mobile no Before I was using my mobile no To log in and I have a premium too,1
I am running the latest android 12 and this is the only app I have ever had issues with,0
"Has become absolutely horrible, can't play music while opening another app without the whole spotify app closing. Checked all settings none restricting it from background activity, yet it still crashes/stops playing everytime i leave the app.",0
The best app for viewing lyrics and listening to music online and offline,1
We can pick make our fave playlist,1
"Absolutely love Spotify!But the recent update sucks!The ""now playing"" bar does not reflect,which makes it impossible for me to skip and pause my music.I have Premium and I can barely get through 2 songs without it cutting out every few seconds.I hope this gets fixed real soon.ðŸ’”",0
Overral I love this app (maybe a little too much) but if there's one feature I wish we still had was the ability to listen to songs before adding them to a playlist it makes creating a playlist more simple and less long of a process and it's generally irritating to not be able too :),0
It is a very nice app and I even saw versions of songs I didn't knew were there example tik tok,1
"I have this on my fire TV, right, same account, right, except on my phone, to listen to the music that I actually like, I have to have something called premium. So it gives you a good experience on one device and on the other it gives you a $Î¼Â¡~Â¥ one. App installed. Would also like for you to please fix!",1
It's a very good app just that I can't pay for premium because I'm using a verve card. I hope that will be rectified soon,1
It's so good like you can turn off your phone but you can still hear the song and it's like so good this is the most is bestest app ever for song you should try someday you download it,1
I love all the songs and the app is surprisingly fast on my 6 year old phone. And it rickrolled me!,1
"This is really a paid app, they might as well put a price on it. If you aren't paying monthly, you can't even choose what song you listen to. That's right, if you pick a song to hear, it plays other random songs that aren't even good. If you make a Playlist, it adds random songs, and you can't choose the order of the Playlist. You can only skip 5 songs an hour, and even after skipping 5 songs you still cant listen to that song. You have to listen to 15 songs and 30 ads to listen to 1 song. Trash",0
Build is completely unstable. Player is broken beyond belief will randomly start playing music completely by itself.,0
The new UI with the Play/Pause button on the left side is the most unintuitive layout to have. Bring the OLD Button layout BACK!,0
"I am current unable to view which song is playing, on my notifications bar and I can't skip nor rewind a song. I am on a premium subscription.",0
Amazing app. Really opened up my world of music. A must have app for any aspiring DJ.,1
"I NEVER thought I would pay for music...EVER! I tried the 3 months free and in the 3rd month started a job I thought I'd NEVER work, mindless machine operator. 1st night, (10hr shift ðŸ˜’), no music. Longest 10hrs of my life. Didn't know they allowed music till I got there. Never had a job that had allowed it! Still had a few weeks left on my trial so the next night? Not my dream job but the music made it...almost enjoyable! I had to pay the 10 bucks for another month. Selection could be better.",1
I love how easy it is to find all my favorite songs and to make a playlist.,1
"It was a great app but now it's full of bugs ever since the new update, I use a xiaomi phone so it might be just a xiaomi thing but I have been dealing with a lot of crashes stuttering and Bluetooth issues ever since I installed the new update, it even has almost broke my Bluetooth watch that I've been using with my phone (mi band 6) I'm starting to feel like there is a conspiracy going on because of the situation involving the drama between Neil Young and Mr Rogan I think the app is sabotaged.",0
Cant get reception occasionally. The music will plY the first tune but will stop in the second tune.Will play again on pressing any button. Plz help,0
I don't know if this is just a problem just for me but everytime I choose a album with just 1 song it plays other songs before I can even listen to the song I'm trying to listen to then it also wastes my skips so then I have to listen to other songs I didn't even want to listen Spotify I think you guys so fix this problem,0
I love Spotify but I wish you guys would just let us listen to any of our favorite artists freely without having to pay a expensive premium let us just click on any song and let us listen to it as much as we want to Spotify I hope you change some things,1
Too many ads,0
"It's okay, Like I've been using Spotify for about 4 years, its pretty good but I don't like how I can't play a song I want and it'll switch to a playlist:/",0
I literally just downloaded the app but I think it's amazing because it has good music and it plays your music even when your not on the app,1
"I really loved the app, but the update is terrible. It won't let me unshuffle playlists and you need premium just for that! It's beyond ridiculous. Please, change this. It just feels like it's pushing us to buy premium. It's extremely annoying. Also, the shuffle feature plays random songs that aren't from my playlist. This app is so confusing now, I just want to listen to my favourite songs.",0
"I only use it to discover music since the free version does not allow you to make use of many features. ***I felt I needed to mention this though: recently this app has been recommending to me VERY specific podcasts that ""happen"" to have to do with matters that I only talk with my friends about, meaning I never look this stuff up online, ever. So it's starting to feel quite creepy. Just saying :|",0
I've been on Spotify for.... I forgot BUT if your looking for a music app I'd say Spotify the only reason it's a 4 instead of a 5 I because you have to get Spotify premium to take the ads awayðŸ˜—,0
This is very good mp3 player,1
"A pretty buggy application. I am regretting buying Spotify premium. Often when I switch songs the music changes but the name, art, etc of the song doesn't change and the application hangs. Sometimes when I play a song it isn't visible in the swipe down menu, so I'm unable to pause it or change it. I've tried reinstalling the app, updating it, and restarting my phone. My device is OnePlus 7 BTW. It's very funny how such a big company hasn't even got basic things right.",0
"Please stop moving my storage without permission or notice. I love the music and ""for you"" curations, but this is driving me insane.",0
excellent app easy to work while doing other things on the phone.,1
last update is buggy and won't show me the song im listening incredibly often. it worked fine before this,0
"Decent app, but can be buggy and take time to load playlists sometimes",0
"Been having some major annoying issues lately, from the music skipping like a CD, to being unable to see the song currently playing and access the skip/play/pause buttons, to now being unable to search for new songs all of the sudden, even after updating. No matter what I type in the search engine, it always says there are no results.",0
I can't search podcasts.otherwise good app.but I very sad About i cannot search or open podcast.,0
"(10 January 2022) There's a bug (maybe). When I choose payment for Spotify premium there are problems. First, the subscription that I choose is different when I want to proceed to payment, and second, the payment that I choose in the first is different too when I go to next step",0
Great app. I have the paid version so no ads. Worth the money,0
"App is so buggy. Just terrible. Shame it's the only way to listen to JRE, because half the time no matter what it just pauses for a split second ever 2 or so seconds. Unusable.",0
The best music app there is,1
"Unskippable ads on podcasts, even though I pay for premium are unacceptable. Also, skipping a 3hr long podcast, 15s at a time is useless. Get your act together. Acceptable music player. Absolutely terrible podcast player.",0
"So slow, it wont even load on my android. On a 5g network too.",0
I just don't like the update where I can't listen to music without it changing to something I don't want to listen.....if you can change the shuffle feature that will be great,0
"I've uninstalled the app, yet jre gets getting pushed to my phone. It's bizarre. The app is uninstalled, yet my phone keeps trying to add it to my media pulldown. Jre. Why?",0
Best app for listening ðŸŽ§ music ðŸŽµ...i am listen all languages song...u should download it...,1
Connected easily to my Smart TV without programming.,0
Great listening . All the artists I can search.,1
No. Mobile sucks cus there are songs I don't wanna listen to and get stupid premium fix your stuff cmon man I dislike this thing you put cus I wanna hear the music I WANT not stupid other things,0
"This app is absolutely amazing with the premium service. My only real complaint is that in the liked songs Playlist you can only select one genre to listen to at a time, it would be great to be able to isolate multiple genres to listen to in you liked songs.",1
Pls fix Spotify. Its keep on crash while i listen to songs before this are not like this.,0
Too many ads and you can't skip them. I don't feel like using this app anymore,0
Great app to listen to music on...10/10 would definitely recommend,1
Great first time experience. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes having his favorite music playing all the time.,1
"Easy to navigate, music and podcasts made available. It's seamless usage at a luxury type of enjoyment, would definitely recommend",1
Nice songs collection but problem is after downloading the songs without internet it's not playing for that we need internet too.,0
"I love spotify, ive had premuim for years now but for about the last year when ever im listening to songs or podcasts whether online or not it will randomly cut out when and act like im opening the app all over again",0
"Okay guys, after reading some of the reviews I am glad I'm not the only one who has their music randomly stop playing. Also, why does it keep telling me to turn on background player or what have you? I follow the link to settings but it never specifies. I've turned on everything I think it could or couldn't be and still it tells me to turn it on. What the heck??",0
"It's a good app music , but it has disadvantages more that advantages .",0
Dear Spotify.... I have a 62hr long playlist. If I wanted to hear the same song 2x in 1hr..... I'd have a 1hr playlist. Please fix the shuffle option to shuffle through the entire playlist before repeating the same song. I can't possibly be the only person unhappy with this.,0
Good selection and making my own playlists is perfect,1
Good,1
This is amazing app.i like it . Every song is available. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»,1
"The best, and always something for every mood!!",1
"Doesn't always play properly. Have to restart app multiple times a day. It doesn't communicate with the widget or during lock screen. Pauses frequently during playback, seemingly to buffer but it's not. It is just not showing or playing properly. Can't even pause or unpause with Bluetooth control without restarting app.",0
Only one drawbacks is Adds are too long ... otherwise it is best ....best song appearance...best playlists â˜„ï¸â˜„ï¸,1
I literally can't pause. The only way to stop audio from playing is to close the app.,0
Besides not transferring over to my replacement phone I still rate five. Good Luck Spotify ðŸ‘,1
Finally the UI is more universal bewteen android and ios. FINALLY after 4 years ðŸ™„ðŸ˜†,0
This is only for vips,1
Find almost every song I want.,1
App is damaged. Crashes constantly with podcasts. Gotta love ignoring the old and the dead trying to disrupt free expression. Neil.....and....that other hag? ( I'm sure she was special at some point). Good luck hoe.,0
"The new update sucks a fat one!! Pauses randomly, the player disappears and I can't pause/stop the music. Edit: after a couple of months, updates, re-installs, these issues are still happening. Very disappinting considering I have a pretty new high-powered Samsung galaxy.",0
"I always hook up my phone to the Xbox so I can listen through my headphones as I play but the problem is that I have it set to full volume and it's still quiet. I tried seeing if there was any settings I could use to change this but it's only on mobile, not Xbox",0
Brilliant in every way. 11/10,1
Favorite music streaming app ATM,1
Exceptional experience. Well designed. Great collection of music. Couldn't ask for better.,1
Best app for free listening music with different language along with different types,1
I like the services it Spotify. But sometimes it don't have some music otherwise there is no issue in the app and service.,0
Music good. Podcasts can be good - but the half listened to section has not been working for me recently.,0
"The songs are good and all but why does it has so many ads after 1 vid and another also it wont let me play another music if i paused another one, i cant choose which song to play bc i have to shuffle on my playlist, the repeat option aint visible for me anymore(?)",0
Been with Spotify for years now and love it the app is amazing especially on tvs great services ðŸ‘ really impressed with it done a good job especially the premium listening i to offline where ever i go its amazing 2022: recently with the new update the sound quality has gotten quiter and idk y it must be to due with the update I compared it with sound cloud same song and on sound cloud its louder. Spotify can u please fix this.,1
"Best music app ever but I'm having problem troubleshooting lyrics in my old account, i can't get my lyrics please fix it soon.",0
The Spotify has many songs it was melody etc,1
"Very Beautiful ðŸ˜ app for music superb audio quality and song l, the advertisement is the only problem.",1
I use the app for podcasts. Every 5 to 10 minutes th podcast stops playing. Part way through a podcast the podcast will stop and change to another episode. Good app but annoying sometimes,0
Keeps glitching when my songs are playing and I can never switch songs anymore,0
Why the near constant pop up for Bluetooth access??? Does the app not understand when denied once? Why do I give Bluetooth access when I am playing off of my phone speakers?? What nonsense is this? Maybe Spotify team needs to focus on making the song suggestion algorithm better instead of needlessly ruining the UI. Apple music is better.,0
It tastes like cheese with a dash of seasoning of seasoning,0
"Short adds, great music Easy to use",1
"I usually love spotify and would give 5 stars but the recent glitches are very annoying. I'll be playing music, lock my screen, go back in to change a song and the song keeps playing but you can no longer see the bar at the bottom that shows what song is playing. And you can't change it. I have to close out the app at least 3 times for the bar to show up again and to allow me to change/control the music. Please fix whatever bugs are going on as soon as possible.",0
"I love this app, but lately it hasn't been showing me when a song is playing at the bottom like it usually does. So I can't pause or skip a song, I have to kill all my apps in order for them to reset and then it shows me what's playing at the bottom.",0
"I hate everything about this app, the most user-friendly app I have ever purchased. Day one and I can not cancel it fast enough.",0
Enjoy building my Playlist and checking out recommended music.,1
Best music streaming app hands down ðŸ¤žðŸ‘Œ,0
"Keeps crashing ..even after software update, nothing else running in background, new phone & strong network connection. SPOTIFY PLEASE HELP.",0
I hate the new update it won't let you pick the song you want to listen to anymore,0
Very good app to listen to music especially when you have premium,1
"Used this app a lot but one day it stopped working. I couldn't play any songs or even open any playlist. I logged out and logged back in but it didn't work and even reinstalled it, I even cleared my storage and cache and updated the app but the problem still remains. It's been a month or so but no matter what I do the app is not responding.",0
Great music! Many genres & artists! I love their podcasts and variety of artists,1
"It has bugs with podcasts. I've downloaded some episodes, and then created a queue to listen to a few specific episodes in a certain order. Then suddenly a completely different episode starts playing and my queue is gone. It's happened many times now, and really reduces the experience",0
"Currently the app is not accessible via its pop up window over the locked screen or on antythibg like that, and the app does not stop playing even if receiving callls play videos etc on both occassions you need to manually enter the app to pause skip etc",0
Its a fantastic app for any music you want,1
"Its been broken for several weeks now. And there's been no word on it at all. Time to leave Spotify. If you do not yet have Spotify, do yourself a favour and spend your money somewhere else.",0
Good music and podcasts. Easy to access and use.,1
They give the perfect lyrics and I enjoy clear music,1
It has been very nice using Spotify till I can afford a steady subscription,1
Started off great. Seems like lately Spotify had been laggy and unresponsive at times. Stops playing music for no reasons. And it's annoying that it ask every time I log in to enable Bluetooth. Debating if I should keep paying for premium ðŸ¤”,0
App spontaneously stops playing music for a second then continues. Also hides currently playing song which is more than likely a bug. Very annoying when listening to music on long journeys.,0
"Love Spotify! I love French Cafe music and this app offers a lot of song titles!! Spotify is my favorite musical app by far:) I'm 55y young, and love their selection of early 20th Century American music as well, especially the tunes with the scratchy record sound!:)",1
"Updated to latest version only to find out, this app will be useless because when you click the song, app itself will exit within 1sec, funny isn't it? what a cute update.",0
"Without the premium this app is crazy and you can't even skip. And whenever you go on an app, it glitches like crazy. Honestly, I'd be better with youtube. I hope you have a good experience but I know I'll didn't.",0
Science is real Edit: I've googled the auto start issue...this has been going on for YEARS and Spotify has yet to correct it. Why do people love this app so much? FIX THIS! Holy hell...I downloaded this because international friends send me links to songs on your service. My issue is that it automatically opens and plays every time I turn my car on and I can't make it stop!,0
"Plays and adds random songs to my Playlist and won't allow me to remove the added songs bad platform for listening to a Playlist of your favorite songs without being forced to listen to songs you don't know, I rate it one star because I've not had such a good expirience with Spotify soo far after a few months of use.",0
Always the right music at the right time with nice selections. ... and the app works perfectly!,1
"I'm having some slight glitches with the album covers showing. I have excellent reception, so that's not the problem.",1
Need accurate song lyrics,0
"Since last update music randomly stops, won't play, stops when phone is locked despite permissions being set up correctly, frequent force closes, and at times will display and play different audio to what has been selected. I am a premium member but will not continue if these issues continues.",0
"Songs stop tho play every minutes,does not work properly ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜¤, it's so bad,I hate that so fix that,and don't tell me check your Internet,my Internet is good,COD,Free fire,Minecraft works properly on my Internet,its not my Internet problem,if you don't fix that you might loose some downloaders not some,loose a lot,that's it for now so fix it,I think you get what I mean.",0
Amazing streaming music app! The sound quality and collections of songs very nice. But some of movie songs not available in spotify. Please add those songs soon.,1
"It's a pretty good app if you pay, but it's awful if you don't. You don't get to skip more than 6 song, pick a song, and there is like 5 ads in a row",0
The best app for music all over the world,1
The music that I want to hear is on Spotidy. It is easy to find songs that you are searching for and the app also suggests other songs that you may also enjoy since you like the current song or album.,1
"I used to really like Spotify, I usedit all the time, recommended it to my friends and family ( many of which have gone premium), but not anymore. Recently while shuffle-playing my favourites, a long carefully curated collection of songs, suddenly songs that aren't on my list started playing, and not on or two, song after song after song by artists which are so dichotomiclly different from my taste in music just shoehorned into my playlist as if the belong there, tainting my user experience.",0
Great music app crashes a lot though,0
"I love Spotify, the only reason I am leaving a 1 star is because this app recently burned through 13.7GB of my data over the last 2 days, which I was connected to wifi for most of the time. For reference, my average Spotify data consumption is around 1.5GB a month, with the highest prior to this being 3.2GB. I do not understand how it is even possible for Spotify to use that much data in 2 days, but now I have no data left until mid March, which I need for my job.",0
I cant listen to songs I want to listen to. I click to play a song and sometimes it plays another song. Unless I get premium or whatever I cant listen to the songs I want to listen to. Not even from my playlist. Ignorence at its finest.,0
"Have premium and it was hands down the best decision for my music,, they recommend songs and create Playlists based on songs and artists you frequently listen too. I am always getting put on to new music by Spotify and I love it!!",1
The recently update has made the app nigh unusable. The pause controls dissappear randomlyand you have to restart the app to get them back and to listen without the music cutting out.,0
I really enjoyed this app. I just wish there was a way to buy the albums permanently. That way I can always enjoy the song without needing to go online for a long time.,1
Please fix bugs. It's been a long time and it's sooooo frustrating ðŸ˜’,0
Love Spotify. I especially like how Spotify exposes me to music that I would normally never hear on commercial radio. Totally recommend,1
Generally works well. Been having an issue lately with play bar suddenly disappearing & no way to control music or turn it off. Have to kill app to get play to stop. Hopefully a reinstall fixes this,0
Nice,1
Best music app with the best prices. Can't go wrong,1
"What is going on? I cant even see the play/pause strip when a song is playing on my phone, meaning I cant turn it off! Even if I force close the app the music is still playing!",0
"this app is so very annoying and i donâ€™t really like the new update of the app. we want the old one were we can listen all the musics we want just for free and not building a choice wherein, you have no choice but to buy premium. THE CREATORS ARE TOO GREEDY! This app sucks, bring back the old Spotify we knew before.",0
"When I cancel your subscription that's what I want, so I cancelled before Christmas and yet the service still carries on, that's why I did not hear any ads, or When I block you it means I do not need /want the service, get me, and customer services are rubbish.",0
I like the feature that has lyrics but it'd be nice to have the option available to cast the lyrics to the same device I'm listening on.,0
Easy to use and to find any kind of music that i like.,1
It has good music and stuff its just the fact that i cant take the songs in my playlist that it says spotify added based on the other songs.,1
"I have used the app for about ten years, on and off premium. My only issue is the small amount of revenue paid to artists. I know some make money, and lots of folks use only the free version, but there are also enough ads. Thanks",0
Omg best music app ever 10/10,1
I used to love this app and could deal with ads. But now with the update or whatever I can't listen to just one song no it has to be shuffled with songs I don't want to hear. And yesterday when I was trying to skip one song (I didn't use any of skips that hour) It wouldn't let me skip and kept saying I discovered a premium feature. I used to want to recommend it friends but I wouldn't recommend to anyone.,1
It's a good app but sometimes it doesn't play the song but it shows that it is playing,1
I just feel that it is way more better and easier to use than YouTube and I really like how it doesn't have ads like YouTube does so ya I really like this app 10/10,1
Being able to choose what I listen to is harder and harder. Focus has gone from users to what Spotify dictate.,0
Keep pausing music for no reason and play music without bar so I can't stop the music or anything it's annoying..,0
"I wake up in the morning and download playlists made for me, then playlists are deleted mid day, forcing me to use data if I want to listen to music when I pay spotify for the ability to listen to downloaded songs. Ive tried the fixes offered, they don't work. I will be deleting and stopping payments in a few weeks. Poor pay to smaller artists plus not being able to reduce my data useage is not worth supporting this company anymore.",0
It's all good but ads are just a little annoying ðŸ’€,0
Great and satisfied but sometimes it takes long to load your downloaded tracks,0
Nice app! But many songs are not present here!,0
The new blend feature only let me blend with one artist is it because I have the free version? Other than that love the app,0
Keeps telling me to check my internet connection. Can't play anything,0
"I cannot play my songs on my spotify app, it closes whenever i try to play a song. If u cant fix this, i will unsubscribe instead.",0
Very good,1
"Hate this app constently messing up and crashing and now i cant even open up the spotify app on desktop like i cant even use the app lmao. Theres no reason a app this big should have so many problems just go on youtube and search ""why is spotify"" and youll see 100s of problems people go through on a app that should just be pretty simple i mean all your supposed to do is listen to music and they cant even get that right. There are so much better music apps plz do not get this app its terribel.",0
When I clicked the music that I want to listen to a giving me a different song,0
"The latest update is an utmost disaster. Music plays randomly and there is no way to stop or pause since the controls are no longer; doesn't stop playing when disconnecting from headphones, car or whatever uses Bluetooth. No control over volume anymore... If you are using Spotify as part of a morning alarm, then you must get very unpleasant wakeups when your phone blasts a song. If this doesn't get fixed, I'm considering cancelling my subscription.",0
"Despite force stops, restarts and reinstalls, persistent problems of a disappearing play bar and playback randomly stopping. I recently got a Samsung phone and apparently this is a known problem. Please fix or I'll take my money elsewhere!",0
Love the Crossfade option and that with premium I can download my music is as a high of a quality as I want I love the discover weekly- where I find all my new songs,1
"I hate Spotify, I can't cancel my subscription after the 6 months free trial. And been billed every month for last 10 months. I have to cancel my card just so they don't keep ripping me off. You make me sick the way you conduct business.",0
MAKE ME HAPPY,1
It of great pressure to keeps me fill safe and love every time I on it and brings back great icons .,1
"Besides the ad's, I love this app!",1
Now this aap is vary vary bad I don't like it because any song if I play this is no playðŸ–¤ðŸ¤®ðŸ’©ðŸ‘ŽðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ ðŸ¤¬,0
"5 Star to 2 star. Widget has stopped working, no notification indicating music is playing in the indicator bar. All songs skip about every 1 minute. S22 Ultra.",0
ITS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE AND YOU CAN LISTEM TO ANY MUSIC FROM CHRISTIAN MUSIC TO ROCK FROM ROCK TO ANYTHING SO MUCH OPTIONS ITS AMAZING YOU CAN LOOK UP A BUNCH OF YOUR FAVORITE ARISTS AND SONGS ITS ASOME,1
Something is wrong with Spotify!! Even when I'm online it says I'm offline. And I can't even access to my liked songs which I've downloaded already!!! Fix this ASAP,0
Recently the app just stops playing and I have to go back in and restart it. Also it's not showing who is playing and all of the genres I used to have disappeared. I'm paying for Premium and it's becoming so frustrating that I just want to cancel sometimes. Need to get this figured out. It looks like it's happening all over. Everything was great. WHAT HAPPENED???,0
"1 star is too much for this app it should be 0 cause it's too restricting, it's very disapointing, i can't even play a song that i want. I don't like the update!!!",0
"I'm new to Spotify & this app, but I'm really impressed so far with it's vast catalog & the app has been very solid & easy to use for me.",1
"even with ads, it's still one of the best music apps",1
"Definitely one of the best music listening apps out there Especially with premium Updates tend to break user interface for a couple minutes, but otherwise it's good :]",1
"Excellent platform for discovering new music, and I've had nothing but good experiences with their support.",1
"It has been showing no Internet connection for the past few days, fix up.",0
I love the app don't get me wrong but the only problem with me is the consent pausing randomly while listening to stuff by itself and it is pretty annoying this has been happening for 2 years and it is just annoying as heck at this point,0
"It would be great if App supports a feature to add a song as â€Play Next"". Apart from that it was Top Class.",1
Been exceptional once. But now you'll gett advertise after every song instead of every 30 min. On free version.,0
Phenomenal never had problems I get all y tunes free but would be better HD without a fee but can't fault it really,1
"I love listening to music through here, I just wish you didnt have to have premium to choose the songs you would like to listen too. All I can do is hit shuffle play",0
Can't play my favourites playlist on my Sonos set up! Seems like an on going problem for years now. Google it and tried all recommendations.,0
Great content and reliable app.,1
I cannot believe i actually pay for this!!!Such horrible playback and there is always a problem!,0
"Love it for podcasts but I have the premium version but I get ads on the podcasts. Not ones put there by the shows, but Spotify ads. They ruin the flow",0
,1
"App is trash, crashes all the time.",0
"Love Spotify, sometimes the app is glitchy, but it could be my phone. Been paying premium for over a year and will continue",0
After every song there is ad this is disgusting,0
Useless. Only good on pc where it actually shows video !!! Whats the point of it on the phone if its only capable of producing audio ?! ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸,0
Poorer by the month. Lots of my liked songs have disappeared because rights have been removed by the artists and now my playlist of 630+ songs only shows about 25. Ridiculous,0
"Ive loved spotifiy since 2015. I can find whatever Im lookong for and more. There are less adds than Pandora and I love that I can play the actual song I am looking for without a paid subscription. Also for me at least, Spotify suggested songs seem to be more in congruance than Pandora when comparing the 2ðŸ™",0
Terrible app that only functions for short periods of time. There are no redeeming qualities.,0
Ads are more frequent,0
Just awesome music app . Superb. Wonderful music app . The best music app in the world .,1
Very interesting and outstanding app. I always enjoy even in the washroom. My favourite singer's songs are available at anytimeðŸ˜â¤ï¸ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡°ðŸ’š,1
Don't like it cause you need to pay money to just listen what you wanna hear and I'm not gonna be having 60 different songs to just listen what I want to hear,1
Shuffle turns on at random. Play controls disappears at times,0
Terrible music recommendations. Horrible interface. It consistently selects 50 awful songs for my daily mix. I don't think it could be this bad if it was just a random selection. It is actively bad.,0
Bring back shuffle play for liked songs.,1
Used to be a good app but now I can't play my playlist. It's just an infinite loading screen and when a playlist DOES play several songs won't play and when I skip one song it'll skip like two or three,0
Heere I'm listening podcasts. Spotify is the best platform so far without censorship.,1
"Bunch of ads in between songs can't buy premium because it doesn't let me and just I can't play whatever song I want, and it's always bugging out.",0
Phenomenal but app keeps crashing since last update,0
"App works fine. Bravo for standing up for free speech in the face of cancel culture. While blue haired karens might scream at you till theyre face matches. Those of us who value the ability to hear everyone greatly appreciate this. Please continue this, i dont pay for any apps, i will get a subscription.",1
This app is hella trash the update ðŸ’€ first really listen anytime until when i play my fav song and theb why the tf is the song changing i was like is this a glitch hell Nah ðŸ’€ im gonna delete this asf bc it's getting boring ðŸ’€ and the music is also wrong ðŸ’€,0
Please fix this bug. I can not see the play bar. Really annoying.,0
Love Spotify best music app out there!!,1
"I am very mad about the new update, everytime i use a playlist after the first song is done it plays a song that not even in the playlist :[",0
For some reason it doesn't play the song you want to play. It skips it and plays another song.,0
I love now being alone because my god and Spotify is with me ..,1
Spotify is a good app and all but recently I'll be listening to songs on my liked and then it will play songs that I never added nor have I ever heard off Is there a reason for this I'd like to know,1
"Ads are killing the experience. First ad says get 30 mins ad free music after ad. Then five mins later another ad pops up. There is either a technical glitch in your push ads or this is done deliberately. Either ways, its not a pleasant experience. I have immediately switched to Wynk.",0
"Randomly stops when listening to music or podcasts. Quite annoying, missing Winamp more everyday.",0
it's a good app but honestly it's really annoying when it keeps playing recamonded songs when I am listening to my playlist. Is there anyway to stop this. maybe it's because I am on a android idk I just want it to stop,0
likeee,1
I unninstalled and tried to download it again but it gets stuck on 72%,0
Ok,1
"So I've been a spotify user for over a year but the app currently logged me out of my premium account that I can seem to get back, everything on my account is not accessible in the app but only in the web browser. Is there any way I can fix this promblem? It's frustrating me",0
"I use to not understand why people used Spotify but I can't live without it now, it's so convenient for music lovers",0
Why cant i get a premium? It has been 6 months since i got a premium but why cant i get now? Is this a bug or malfunction?,0
"Why can you rate 5 stars if somebody else can load music, so if somebody else load music on this app, how much music was on the app for you too pay for a discripttion.In other you pay for the app ,not for the music",0
When I first learned about Spotify. I tried it and I was very happy. Because I listen to music all the time. It relaxes my soul. You have a variety of music to choose from. And how ever list you want to make. Since my husband passed away. My Spotify got cut off . My funds were short couldn't afford it. I was going crazy. The other apps I didn't care for them . I had to have my Spotify. So who's ever ready this try it. Believe me you'll love it. Now I pay it up for three months at a time. Mrs W.,1
"So much better than Pandora. The monthly subscription is the way to go, and so worth the price.",1
This app is very bad too much bugs I have purchased for 1 year this thing is very bad I can't use it too too much bugs fit it now,0
Incredible app. Easy to select songs and play,1
Fantastic application. I find almost everything I like in here. Priced very fairly. Discovery options and daily mixes are really good at showing you new music.,1
Too many ads now. 5 ads before I was able to play the first song.,0
So much of ads 1 ad was played continuously for 4 times ðŸ˜¡,0
Best music ever,1
"This pop up that CONSTANTLY asks to access Bluetooth needs to go away already. There should be a NO option on it, I stead of ""may e later"" which the app thinks means 2 seconds later. Nope, not now either!",0
"I don't think I could survive without my Spotify, I always hear what I want to hear",1
STILL the best music app I have ever had!,1
Upgrade It! We love Spotify in our household. I was one to never Upgrade to premium on music apps or any apps. But we decided to and I couldn't be more happier! This is easily the best music player app out IMO! Highly recommend it and highly recommend upgrading to premium!!,1
"It is not a bad app you can listen to your favorite podcast and music. Yes, there might not be a lot of skips and there is adds but overall this is a good app.",1
So awesome i get my free songs . But there is one teeny teeny tiny toe problem it have add after every 30 min . Just that and this app is amazing amazingo fantastic.ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ¥°,1
"I've always really liked Spotify but over the last months more and more problems became obvious: Sometimes it'd stop playing, wouldn't show what song was playing at the moment, etc. And now I need to open the app at least twice because it doesn't show me the current song playing so regularly. Also, I can't play the little preview thing anymore when I want to add more songs to my playlist. Cane to see if I could update the app but apparently multiple people experience similar issues.",0
It's awesome except the songs I can't find. Or the constant need to update. Or the downloaded songs not being available offline. Other than that awesome app,1
Best music streaming service out there IMO. The app is very easy to use. Everything is very smooth and fluid. The playlists are pretty accurate most of the time. Sound quality its excellent. A paid subscription makes the experience even better.,1
Spotify :Play music... very useful to listen....,1
It's good all of my fav. Song I can easily find it and to listen,1
"Still going strong with this app. It's helped me through breakups, homework, school, and parent arguments so <3333",1
"Iv'e had spotify for a month now and everything was going great until today. I can't play my playlist anymore and it isn't in the order I had it in. It shuffles and when you search the song it wont even play it, it just plays a different song. Please fix this.... I want my music back...",0
Omg ðŸ˜ðŸ˜my fav app ever. It has really good qualityðŸ’‹ðŸ¥‚,1
"I really love this App...ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’— But The irritated thing is, There are too many Adds which always spoils my mood when I listen to music.",0
You cant go into your playlist and play songs in order like you could before now you HAVE to litaen to it shuffled,0
I think Spotify is the best music app and he is best .,1
What I would do without it I love it I love making my playlist you have everything I need I pay for the premium I don't have ads,1
"Love it, my daughter enjoys a lotâ¤ï¸",1
My go to for listening to music. Definitely need premium to enjoy the full experience with the mobile app but it's worth it if you're an avid music listener.,1
App keeps stopping playing every 15 to 30 seconds. So buggy overall. Garbage for such a huge company.,0
"Spotify is posting false ""scientific"" propaganda about Covid as ad links between my podcast episodes. (Except Dave Ramsey is correct on the economics of Covid shutdowns.) Podcast feed sometimes fails to include all latest episodes, as if some are being censored for Spotify's political reasons. Buggy. App cache seems to get corrupted frequently. Behaves okay for a while after cache delete. Sleep mode sometimes turns off by itself. Downloaded playlists are often ""lost"" and require re-download.",0
Best music finding app in the business,1
So far the apps works fine. Please strike a deal with Umobile Malaysia so that I can subscribe from them and don't need to buy gift card anymore for 3 months subscribtion. TQ Spotify,1
"I cant connect my android phone spotify to my car pioneer player spotify once i did an update! Absolutely horrible experience. Dont know how to fix this situation! Disappointed especially coming from a so called ""world class"" app!!!",0
This app is so good for me to listen songs,1
I have always loved Spotify from the date of Inception all the way to the present just wish I could get the premium for no money but that's just cuz I'm cheap but it's it's a great app I've never had an issue with Spotify or the or the music don't care a whole lot about all the suggestions they making stuff but it always plays clear crisp hands down the best one I've used,1
ðŸ‘ amazing its just the ads that bother me other than that it's really good.,1
"I love the app and you should because you can't search your favorite artist and download the song. Thank you Spotify ðŸ˜˜ By the way I was a kid when I downloaded this app, Me,my brother,my mom,and my dad downloaded this app 1/2year ago! So I'm very happy for this app.",1
"It's not an overstatement to say that this app changed my life. Music, fill my soul!",1
It is the best music app that exists,1
Umm It's an okay app overall but it likes to play like 1 second of the song I'm listening to.I can't even shuffle my music anymore.,1
It's been difficult to make payment on your platform from Nigeria. Kindly may available other mode of payment. Thank you!!!,0
Great job...now we can distribute our misic easy,0
Spotify is a very good app to share playlist with loved ones,1
I like this app Numerous songs All languages ,1
I can't get threw a day of work or home for that matter without my Spotify best app I ever used,0
"I LOVE THIS APP.BEST MUSIC APP EVER. IT'S ALMOST LIKE ALL ROUNDER , BUT I WISH I HAD AN OPTION TO DELETE HISTORY AND THAT TO SINGLE (I MEAN RECENTLY PLAYED PODCAST, SONGS, EPISODES ETC) CAN U PLS ADD THIS FEATURE.. ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜¥ AND ALSO THERE ARE MANY SONGS (ESPECIALLY BTS SONGS) THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE. SO PLS CLEAR THIS MATTER, CUZ I THINK MOST OF ARMYS INCLUDING ME WANT THOSE SONGS.. AND CAN U PLSS PUT KOREAN-ENGLISH AND KOREAN TRANSATION PLSSS",0
excellent music,1
Love the different genres of music that you can listen to depending on the mood you are in!!,1
"Stole all of my data even with the appropriate settings ticked. it randomly throws the setting to the wrong position, and then downloads a bunch of stuff. The free version doesn't have an offline mode to prevent this.",0
Easy-to-use and huge selection,1
Abundance of selections and styles or genres to fit your taste. Great app.,1
Premium> any other way to spend money,0
its a very nice app to refresh our mind by listening music .....I am using this app for 1 year but there are two thing that I don't like that firstmost - we can't downlod songs without premium and second one is adds after every 2-3 songs there is an add ....putting add is fine but a lot of add sometimes irritate us then I close the app after getted annoyed ...otherwise this is the best app as we cn use this app background also ..,1
Easy to find what I like not much in the way of distractions Which I like but I am waiting for your ads to piss me off then I will bin this app again ðŸ˜›,0
I liked it at first but then it started only allowing you to have 6 skips for every hour.,0
Best music app on the earth,1
Add a damn option to confirm whether you want to connect to a certain Bluetooth device or not. Had too many occasions where the options for connections would bounce all over the place due to constantly finding and forgetting ones only to mis-click away from the thing I wanted instead to a device someone else is always using. Awkward to use and inconvenient.,0
"Hey guys I'm disappointed the app was great before the changes,now the app is doing its own thing I can't play the actual song I want pls do something before I try another app",0
Basically I have no choice to listen to music. ðŸ˜‚ Thanks,0
Best app ever thankfully its like a habit to listen many cool things around go check it out thankfully ðŸ‘,1
"Refund your customers!!!!! Unistalled and reinstalled 20 times, deleted Cashe and Data, still cant pause, ffwd, rewind songs. Its a known issue for months yet Spotify have done nothing. Liked songs vanish after awhile, why? The Daily drive feature just repeats the same songs. Because I listen to rain sounds at night (even thou I haven't liked them) the Discover playlist is 90% rain sounds. When I Shazam a song, then follow the Spotify link it often comes through as Song not found.",0
"I love Spotify, I use it everyday and have over 600+ songs on my liked play list. I have also have this for 5 years. There is nothing wrong with this app but there is this thing that annoys me. You only get 6 skips an hour.",1
"Updates broke the app badly. Player freaks out, songs stop for no reason, controls dissappear.",0
I given five star but you are play video of the song like your ads btw it's amazing,1
"The app has become increasingly less stable since the last update and they consistently make random, unnecessary changes to the layout of the mobile app at least every other month. Change for the sake of change is annoying, it's not an improvement just because you move a button.",0
"I'm not sure what is going on with reliability lately - if it's the app or Android OS but Spotify freezes, pauses constantly. Very frustrating, especially after cache clearing and restarting my phone. This should be sorted before too long. I know a good number of other people having these issues aswell. Ill have to cancel my subscription if these issues persist. Brand new phone so it can't be the hardware. * Seems like now Spotify won't share links either?",0
I just recently had my account hacked into and the Gmail was changed I took to customer service and was able to quickly get access back into my account The account is now under the right Gmail my password is changed and Im back to listening to music Overall a great experience and and a great team Definitely deserves the 5 stars PS Sorry to the person helping me out the chat glitched on my part and I was sent back to the chat bot Thank you for your service you were a great help,1
You HAVE to subscribe to the Ed Mylett Show. He always comes with phenomenal life and business tips and advice and always gives you the kick in the butt and the encouragement you need. Absolutely love it!!!! Give it a listen you won't regret it.,1
I love music this app is perfect for music good quality music all music lover must install,1
"Spotify is a great service,but the app gets buggy sometimes. Managing podcasts can be a chore also, but overall it's pretty good.",1
"I love using it, other than I can't use cashapp to pay for premium",1
"Love Spotify, unfortunately you almost have to buy the subscription so you're not bombarded with ads. I also don't like that for some reason all my saved (liked) songs and albums just disappear, it will only ever show me my most recent - not sure if ther is a limit, but either way it's annoying, especially that I pay $17 a month!",0
Songs are again play after complete and need to give next track manual,0
"The app does not respond properly after being used for a few hours. To solve, need to restart Samsung phone, or re-install the app. Issues range from no button response, unable to pause a podcast, to all playback slowing down.",0
I love it ,1
The best streaming platform,1
Appropriate Auto selection of songs and music,1
"Honestly, Spotify would get 5 stars from me, if it didn't have this little issue. I was a one time owner of Spotify Premium, and I forgot to pay my dues. So I cancelled my subscription and it didn't let me listen to my music even after I cancelled it. Leaving me to uninstall it and reinstall it, which kinda bothers me because unfortunately my phone takes quite a while to install things, that's why I got everything I needed installed before I officially set up my phone.",0
Ever time I try to listen to a certain song it always play something different.,1
I wanted to listen to a song not only did it make me watch two adds it also played the wrong song and when I say wrong I mean completely different song from the song I wanted when I first got it it was fine but now it's getting worse and worse every time I use it.,0
Keeps crashing playing bar goes ghost repetitive liked songs keeps playing the same songs over and over. Might uninstall,0
S21 user here. Sometimes i cannot pause the apps because the play button at the bottom just vanish,0
User friendly and easy to manage,1
It's quality band easy to search musiv,1
"Music and play lists are great, but it doesn't respect the 30min ad free time for none premium members. It plays multiple ads back to back, however other then that it has been a good experience for me.",0
I am 100% sure this is the worst music app I ever used . Nothing good about it . Full of adds you can never play the song you search and a lot of other shity stuff . Never recommend this to someone,0
I really enjoy the discover weekly playlist.,1
Spotify is where it is at! ðŸ˜€,0
There are no lyrics in my app TT. I have a premium subscription tho. I don't think this issue will ever be fixed and so I won't change my rating until then.,0
"I love this app, personally I have the premium duo I share with a family member, but once ads are out of the way, this is the best music app to listen to your favorite songs on!",1
GooglePlay please enable us to give 0 stars as well,1
I have been with Spotify for years now and don't plan on going anywhere,0
Love it. Unbelievable. If you haven't got GET IT,1
Everything was perfect until my last update can't even play a single music or play the songs I've searched for,0
"I have been using this app from more than a year but now it has become so tough to use this app whenever I open this app it shows your are offline, there is no problem in my wifi network cause the other apps are working really good ..... whenever I try to log in to my existing account it shows that you are offline....I want you to solve this problem soonest possible Thank you â¤ï¸",0
"Really good, like the mini premium packages too... Recommended ðŸ™ŒðŸ¼",1
Good app. Cheap but good subscription. ðŸ‘,1
"Have no complaints, very easy to use and listen to Spotify every single day at work. It's 2/11/2022 and still have premium and love it. I wouldn't be able to function at work without this kickass app. ðŸ¤˜",1
Best music app hands down,0
Love the spotlight on the artist I select by playing more back to back song perform by them!,1
"I get the bad press Spotify receives and disagree with it, but at the end of the day, Spotify provides the product I'm actively searching for: Music I like and they provide it at a price point I can afford: Free. And if I am indeed the product, according to the modern idiom, I wish them only the best of luck, because I've been trying to get people to follow my Spotify playlists forever and nothing, many hands make light work as they say.",0
Yesterday the app was fine but now the songs are not in ordrr and i cant even really play them please change it back or this will stay as one star,0
Amazing service and exceptional quality. I love it.,1
I love the App And it has cool mÃºsica,1
Great to have music you like at your finger tips,1
My songs arent playing inspite of having a high speed internet connection. Everytime i try to play a song it says you are offline. Please fix this bug spotify.,0
This is wow f,1
"Love it especially every favorite song i play, especially since I'm a huge music head.",1
"The UI is super intuitive, the premium features are cool, it just great overall. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is how it doesn't really pay artist well.",1
I listen to Spotify every day. Podcast mostly. I love that I can always find new stories. Very interesting. Keeps me coming back daily for more.,1
"The mobile application is trash. On PC it plays the song you want and then random songs. On mobile it shuffles songs, so I can never listen to the one I want. While I love spotify for PC, It's horrible for mobile.",0
Almost perfect better than Pandora slacker and that other one in my pointless opinion,1
Wish I could back track without having to subscribe,0
I enjoy using Spotify but it's extremely difficult to update payment details. I've been trying to do this via the app and web for the last one hour to no avail! Check it out asap.,0
Best music app in the world,1
Buggy as always. Player screen not avilable. Unable to stop playback.,0
"If I'm paying for the service I expect no Ads. The App is very glitchy. Plays songs when the App isn't even active. Shows one song while playing another. Tracks and Podcasts skip/stick on a regular basis. I have been waiting for Spotify to fix these issues as there are alot of reviews saying the same thing. I pay for Premium but still get alot of Ads in all the Podcasts. The Adverts in Podcasts are a pain and should be removed when you pay for premium! Otherwise, what's the point?",0
please revert the play button placement ..,0
"It's a great app, it's just there's this glitch that when I try to play a song it stops at like 7 seconds into the song, I would highly appreciate if this were to be fixed.",0
Great App. Don't have to go far to stream tunes,1
So many diffent types of music!! I love it,0
Podcast keep crashing and forgetting what you were up to. Better off just downloading it elsewhere and using a different app to listen to it. Ridiculous that a subscription app whose only purpose is playing audio can't reliably play audio,0
Nice music app Thank you spotify,1
Love it,1
"Really tired of the glitches on Spotify over the last few years. Sincerely thinking of switching services. Have to consistently Force Stop and reboot app so that user controls (ability to pause) show back up. Also despise the fact that it boots automatically when linked to my car...annoying if I am not expecting it AND it should be optional, not automatic.",0
"It's really great, I really like it. The best app ever muak muak. But maybe you could add like, maps? To group different playlists? For example, I make playlists for my original characters and it would be nice if I could group all those playlists together to have it more organized! But yeah overall it's a great app, I always have music on. ðŸ’ªðŸ»",1
Bro u the best bt whts with the adsssss? There's an ad almost after every song ðŸ¥²,0
"With premium it's good. Without it, we don't talk about it, but even with premium the shuffle algorithms like to pick the same songs over and over",1
"constant ads. not only that but my mixes no longer give me the option to choose which song i want, now it's presented as regular playlists. how the hell is it supposed to know my music taste if i can't even choose what i listen to?",0
Spotify is doing a terrible job with this disaster of an app. Keeps getting worse with every update.,0
Been a Spotify premium member for years.. I love this app but right now it's at an all time low with bugs and glitches and the devs don't seem to want to fix it,0
It's a good music app but the problem is that when I wanna listen to a song it plays a completely different one at first I didn't get annoyed but it kept on happening please fix this.,0
Enjoying it,1
Keeps kicking it self out. So annoying. I have that it plays 3 songs and it cuts out. Need to fix,0
I have an android so I used YouTube music but when I found out Spotify doesn't require money I rushed to sign in unlike YouTube music when I turn on off my phone it still works,1
Lots of ads at every 2nd song avg,0
Fantastic all my music in one place,1
My spotify lags and isn't stopping like it use to when I switch screens and continues to play when I try to pause it,0
The stupid playlists should not update until I have wifi and it needs to be easier to find music that I have downloaded. As some one who works in a cooler where I have no wifi or signal it's infuriating to have the playlists get deleted the second I step out of the cooler in the morning.,0
App keep pausing all the time on galaxy s10. Is annoying,0
"Great as is but still improves as they develop the app, Love it.",1
"I can't dislike songs, I don't know if that's just because I can't find the button or what but I don't like some songs that end up in my daily mix, I also can't figure out how to remove specific songs from my downloaded daily mix. Also also the songs stutter 2henevr I'm using other apps, much prefer my old music app",0
Its a great app to listen to music there is a bunch of different songs there best app ever<3,1
I love spotify i use a lot sometimes it glitches i just reinstall it and it works fine but other than that i would highly recomend,0
The skipping limit is a dumb paywall. But I enjoy using it on my console â˜ â˜ ,1
Best all Music i like have,1
The best music application yet,1
"I love having my podcasts and music in the same app. I love having my favorite suns on repeat, and all the recommendations I am given based off my listening and likes.",1
Enjoyable experience and has great amounts of music to listen as well. Thanks for providing us what we like to rememember the greatest music of all time.,1
More like 4.5 but I do enjoy Spotify,1
"I love the music selection for so many genres, this app is safe and highly recommended.... 5 - Stars ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ",1
It's great! Very awesome how I get to praise and worship God through song!!! I Love ItðŸ™ðŸ’¯,1
I love Spotify all my favorite ganres and artists play in one.,1
"I don't if it's just me or what, but I hate it when the share lyrics button removed on my spotify, I'd suggest to put that feature again.",0
"This app really sucks! I don't know what happened but last week, I've been getting these bugs like my liked songs are only playing in 10 seconds and when you exit from the app, it will stop. Also, I can't play my normal playlists without playing it in the shuffle button. This frustrates me.",0
"Why is it when I search for a song, and find it, I can't just play it. Instead I have to shuffle and play a playlist that it's in - get a grip Spotify, I won't renew my premium until this issue is resolved",0
"Screw you guys for getting rid of car mode to FORCE people to buy your stupid ""Car Thing"" which only works on premium too. I'm not buying your car thing, and I want the car mode back so I can listen to music whilst driving and have the screen always on, so I can swipe stuff quickly and glance over without having to turn my screen on and mess around with changing songs etc. You're going to cause crashes",0
Sometimes I try and listen to a Playlist and it will play the same first song and I try to go to a different one and it goes back to the same first one... little weird.,0
This app is the best it has all my favorite songs I literally have had this app for like 5 years and nothing has happened. if you are saying this has problems maybe delete it and download it again. If you are new Wright your sign up things on a peace of paper. Rating 100000000/20.,1
Love the variety of choice that fits any mood. Easy to use and even easier to enjoy.,1
Best music experience.,1
I've been using it for years. But only just started having constant issues. And after reading about it and the reviews it isn't just me and it's a very recent thing. Really would like to see this resolved Spotify has been my go to for years.. the multi-device aspect is supposed to be convenient bit if Im using my ps4 it will just shut down every 5-10 minutes and then randomly start playing on my phone. Even if I dont have the phone or ps4 controller in hand.,0
Actually they have a very good quality advertisement. I'm actually vibing to their Ads.,1
Easy and convenient it's worth the ðŸ’µ an download.,1
Good just wish it labeled better so it was more user friendly,0
"Spotify itself, great. Good music, high quality, no problem there. But the app is horrible. So buggy, takes forever to load, sometimes it doesnt load at all. Now this might not be a lot, but recently it has gotten too much and I am seriously thinking about switching to a provider with a stable app. It's a jokeðŸ‘Ž",0
Love listening to podcasts!!!,1
the music sounds are amazing except that when I play a song it say that im playing nothing so there for I give this app four stars also each time it doesnt work I have to undownload it and then redownload it again other wise I love the app and I understand if the owner can't fix this problem but I would like them to try and I have been using spotify for atleast half a year once again I love the app also the same thing happend when I play a podcast it keeps the picture thats it <3,1
"So much ads are there and when you wanna buy subscription,this is not happening and also if you email them to help in buying subscription than its just like who cares ,,,",0
"Yo Spotify, everyone around me share their favorite lyrics in their Instagram story, and here I am after updating your app twice can't still use that feature, and also Spotify wrapped appeared to be really really late yk ;_;, dang I'm so disappointed to the point I uninstalled you green wifi, but good for you, I installed again ðŸ¤§ with all due respect I really appreciate if you get my account fixed. Have a good day ðŸ¥°",0
Its good but man can you improve the treatment for non premium users?? Like 2-3 ads after every track is annoying.Very disapointed.,0
"The app is good but I just can't stand why the albums covers have such a bad quality, even the canvas, it looks like in the ugliest resolution posible",0
"I love Spotify ! It's cheep, different libraries for different ðŸŽ¶. Examples country, rap, rock etc. Love it !!!!",1
Awsome app and features But add light mode and dark mode switching option,0
Y'all should use Spotify! It's the best ðŸ˜Š,1
great app super easy and i love how we make our playlists,1
Please fix the UI. Everyone I know has the bottom title/pause bar disappear regularly.,0
Spotify keeps crashing in the past hour and i already try to reinstall but it doesnt solve the problem,0
Chii ,1
As a consumer an a artist Spotify been good with innovation on algorithms. Pay could be better but they put my song in front of different audiences who now follow everywhere,1
"Latest update = can't see currently playing track, or media controls.",0
"I really did like this app, but then they added a preview update now its really hard to play a certain song, they also add random songs to your Playlist and it's really annoying so yeah.",0
The home page is useless and annoying. Spotify rejects the idea that premium users will have ability to arrange the home page to their needs. ðŸ˜¬,0
It used to be good but after an update somehwat nothing function anymore. When I played the songs from the favorite tabs in only play a small part of it. And worse now most songs cannot be played individually and is in a playlist but you have to listen to more songs that you are not looking for just to get to the specific song you want,0
Overlay no longer works. Only way to see what's playing is to kill app and restart.,0
Spotify is the best ðŸ’š I love the new version of the app. It works perfectly. Thank you for your efforts!!!,1
The free version sucks so bad. Only 6 skips an hour + the 17 million ads that play every second + not even getting to pick what song you want. I'm not paying 10 dollars a month to get what should be the default. Just make premium a one time buy. Also get rid of like 90% of the ads and let me listen to the music on this so called music app.,0
My app has started crashing all of a sudden. Everytime I click on a song. There is a lot of space and RAM on my phone so I know that's not causing the crash. SPOTIFY KINDLY RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.,0
"Thanks for getting rid of the smaller widget, now I have to have a whole home screen dedicated to the biggest widget. Thanks for nothing.",1
The app will just stop in the middle of a podcast and I have a hard time switching from podcast to podcast. I pay for the app and I have Uninstalled and reinstalled to see if it was something weird and I am still have trouble.,0
I personally use Spotify as my first choice music player and it's good but sometimes it doesn't show to album cover for albums that I have downloaded even with a working internet connection.,0
"Their shuffle algorithm is the worst, its almost like they don't care. Seriously considering switching to YouTube prime",0
"App keeps crashing, songs don't always play and many other bugs. Fix app plz.",0
"Amazing app, if you fix that it doesn't add more than one songs to queue and randomly skips queues when opened and played straight from the bar below...And please bring lossless music asap.",0
Samjoy Debbarma,1
Spotify is hands down the best music app I've used. It has every song you could imagine and lots of fanmade playlists to enjoy. It also has a fair parental ristriction that still gives a good 70 percent of the music. Defo recommend,1
I am an artist hopefully that explains the 1 star,1
I prefer the old version .new update not working well . It keeps cutting out on music . Not a very good update needs to be fixed ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤« I use premium and expect a good service for my money ðŸ’µðŸ’µðŸ’µðŸ’µðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° now when I open it . Sometimes I'm getting a blank screen. And no mucic when I open app. ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ its happening a lot now . that when im out .the music just stops . i pay for this service and i expect it to work properly . ????,0
My cultivated favorites playlist is the best musical experience I've ever had,1
cmon give me a break ads always pop when i listen to 2-4 music,1
Good App UI. Excellent music collection. I mainly use it via chromecast and in that aspect it is quite terrible. Loses connection all the time. Keeps on connecting and disconnecting from my chromecast.,0
"Really good app, sometimes freezes and you have to close it but that doesn't bother me too much. Would be nice if it didn't do that tho",0
"I love this app because I can make unlimited playlists, share them with friends, and explore new music! Spotify quickly learned my music taste and never fails to deliver!",1
The best music app ever..Other apps are just copy cats,0
Buggy mess as of the past few months. Constantly skipping and crashing.,0
I paid premium already but it keep asking me to pay again and again even put my premium in pause!!!!! Fixs it broo!!!!,0
"The days of MP3s and Wav files seem like they're finally gone. It's kind of sad, but with features like listening with your friends on Discord, and Spotify's algorithm to recommend artists, I've listened to three times the amount of music that I used to. I will stay premium likely for years to come.",0
Excellent app to listen to music. And it is the best one out there.,1
Very good and reliable. Only issue is that sometimes music will cut off but act like it keeps playing despite my headphones having no issues but this may be an issue with my phone.,1
"Good, but would be nice if you could turn these songs into ringtone",1
Very bad experience Daily same song play in premium,0
makes work much easier great app,1
"Cool app, but an upgrade is neeeded in the next update on 19.5:9 screen ratio isn't stable",0
App gets stuck in endless loop of ads. I have to restart the app just to listen to music again.,0
"It's a very good app for listening music but there is a scam or what that it says 30 minutes of uninterrupted music but ad shows up after 2,3 songs.",0
It's not worth it just go on YouTube it says no ad for 30 minutes than gives me an ad ad after 1 song not only that but it says something is a song but if you click it it's just a Playlist and that song isn't even in it like I'm scrolling through a song title 8 times but their Playlist with other sons but the positives are good sound and it plays even when you phone is off so a 2 star out of 5,0
Spotify is definitely my go to app for listening to music,1
Great apps for music and podcast lovers for all generations! â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,1
I use to listen to my playlists on here and sometimes I still do!,1
Very worst experience. still lyrics is unavailable often reinstalling lot a time... How long this happening fix this kind of issues as soon as possible. Really feeling bad,0
I love that I can have multiple Playlist and can access them at anytime and anywhere,1
"perfect except that not playing what i want thing. its just annoying. (frankly reminding that TYLER, THE CREATOR is best)",1
Just downloaded this because I need a song and a track haha,0
Uhm... so the reason only 4 star's is cuse sometimes it like dies on me like my music don't play anymore so yea.....,0
"Excellent soundtracks, artist selections and daily mixes but you need to go premium (paid) for high quality sound and downloads. BTW this app consumes outrageous amounts of data. It's one of the best music apps ( no doubt ) but it lacks in a few areas. The premium rates are completely justifiable for the the benefits you get in exchange. Audiophiles will love the premium version. The app's got your back with a wide range of activities and moods. I'm very satisfied with Spotify.",1
This is an amazing app it helps me calm down and feel activated more whenever I listen to musics in here this app entertains me the buts I can play songs even if my gadget is off,1
I want my green hearts back,1
"Not stable, loads of bugs here and there. Now i can not edit my playlists although i am a premium user. The 3 dots on the side of the song dont give me the option to edit and when i emder the playlists there are no 3 dots available for the playlist.",0
My go-to music no matter the mood I'm in. I can always find a good variety of songs from all genres!!!,1
Great music ðŸŽ¶ and we ALSO enjoyed lot of from Spotify â¤ï¸,1
Great love that I can make my own Playlist easy to do for a senior person who loves old and new artists. THANKS.,1
"Plays automatically and unprompted when I connect to the bluetooth in my car, this is irritating. Stops mid song, won't skip forward or backwards. This app is more annoying than anything",0
It's really amazing app but I have some problem....when I play BTS group song... it's not working but I play other k-pop songs.. it's working...so Plz fix it,0
App is crashing always after renewing to Spotify premium. Not able to listen songs from app. Instead i am using web player in Mobile browser. Very disappointed â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸. This is happening from today only. My Mobile brand is IQOO7,0
I can download lots music. My favorite old school music,1
"I love it so much !!! Only 1 problem, when im driving and there's a place with no internet service. The app dosen't work.It would be cool if it worked too :(",0
So easy to use and has a wide selection of songs to listen to but if you don't have premium you get ads interrupting you between each song every 5 minutes,0
Just keep stopping for no reason. Have to force close to get it working again. ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸,0
I had premium for the longest time and loved it but recently I stopped it just temporarily the way they handle the free listing is very restricted I only recommend the app if you intend on getting premium,0
Great sound and awesome collection of music.,1
I don't like the update like why do we need a Premier to peek at the next song and in playlist it plays shuffle always u can't remove it for some reason please remove this update,0
Spotify fix this when I play a song it plays a different song Spotify fix yo damn app I mean it's great but fix it pls,0
"I keep trying to listen to music. So basically I pick a song and it automatically just switches to a random song. This is pretty annoying to me and I'm getting really upset and it is freaking me out how I can't just pick one song. And many ads pop up before I even get the chance to pick one. And The interrupted listening isn't even close to 30 Minutes and still annoys me. I barely use this app anymore and I need Spotify to fix this. Until then, 3 stars for Spotify.",0
App is good but they indirectly force you to get a subscription,1
I hate the ads but it's good and plus u can turn off ur device and it still work god bless please can u remove some ads maby at least 2 ads thank you,1
"Fhis is very good app for listen music of favourtie singer .but ,there is some problm in this app first very add are there and very long ad but like this app .what can we do at home when we haven't anything to do ? We can pass our time from this app.",1
Good,1
Quit playing songs that are not in my playlist,0
"Quality of the app has definitely going downhill. Recently experiencing song skipping when playing through bluetooth earbuds, opening the app to a blank screen and having to restart it, and since getting a new device, the notification ""playing on this phone"" is broken, showing several songs that are *not* playing, that I can't seem to get rid of no matter what, nor will they actually play from the bar and just seem to be completely glitched. EDIT: 13/5/22 Now you've moved the play pause button??",0
"Honestly I used to love Spotify and hype it up to everyone I knew. With this new update it always says ""no internet connection available"" no matter what. I can't load my Playlists, I can't download songs, I can't even open the app half the time!! Absolutely awful lately, highly considering going to another music app asap.",0
Works great and a lot of easily accesible options,1
It makes the music clear,1
Playlists are good. Auto Play of songs is awesome features because it plays automatically the best songs.,1
I have a family plan and I think Spotify is one of the greatest things to ever be invented-,1
"It's fine but why do you need to pay premium to Pick a song, It sucks because what if you find a song that you like you have to pay PREMIUM to pick it byt if you dont you have to put it into a playlist full of other Songs then you have to hope that you get it in the few skips that you got so that you can listen to it. AND ANOTHER THING, you cant even Loop a song You need to PAY To do that, Just an F.Y.I I dont type this much, SO THATS HOW MAD I AM",0
"Well, from my experience, it's a good app. I never encountered any annoying problems or anything. So yeah, good job.",1
Great music with no ads,1
This app has helped me through so much. My playlist is almost 69 hours worth of music from all different genres. I find tons of new music I enjoy everyday. Spotify premium isn't very expensive and it's totally worth it. Spotify has quite literally saved my life. ðŸ’šðŸ–¤,1
Use to be great. Had Spotify for a long time offline always worked well and stuff downloaded. Now it's super slow to pull up Playlist and sometimes doesnt work at all offline even though I pay. Not sure this app is worth paying for anymore.,0
Has anybody experienced the Mike Rowe's podcast freezing and not playing at all?.,0
Last update broke it. No play bar.,0
Could be alot better seeing that im paying for premium. I keep having to deal with my music randomly shuffling on its own and it keeps stopping my music mid way everytime I listen to it more then 20 minutes. Very garbage app,0
"Recent update has caused several glitches. Keeps freezing and stopping on podcasts every 10 minutes, Bluetooth keeps disconnecting randomly, can't find what I'm currently listinging to in order to pause rewind etc. And I feel like my playlists always shuffle in the same order so some of my songs are over played while others I never hear.",0
i enjoy the music here.thank you spotify for the free music!!!,1
"2022 and still no option to add a song to several playlists at once. I've been messaging them via Instagram, even wrote to the support via E-Mail and so on. I've been a Spotify premium customer for years now and this problem stands to this day. Really frustrating to be honest. Other than that the app is obviously alright and I am enjoying the service a lot. Low rating in hope to finally gain some attention...",0
Refusing to recognize play lists. Now using browser version until fixed ðŸ˜’,0
"The best Music app so far. kudos to u ,guys!",1
Yes the app is really good and it has good songs and I love it's.,1
The offline mode toggle should be om the home page and not in settings. Additionally i really want to be able to view my queue and next songs on my watch (wear os) app.,0
Please give old version update because we can't hear the song before add in any playlist....,0
Fix the bugs and glitches!,0
This app is not for listning song its only for listning dozens of ad,0
Worse music player ever.. I can not play any music that I want.. I only can play the entire playlist and unable to choose one fav song..,0
Can't skip songs if not in the mood.... went from 5 to 2.... good luck I have to wait till a song I want to listen to as I can't just click and listen,1
I m facing problem from last week ...app stops working shows not internet connection while all other apps are working smoothly..please help me resolve this issue,0
Best Streaming Platform!!,1
App keeps crashing whole screen goes black all i can do is close it and re open it but its still a huge inconvinience when i pay for uniterupted music ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¼,0
"I give thanks for being Link in , I enjoy to be here in and I promise I will keep my self calm to learn everything I want to know ðŸ˜Š",1
Please ,1
"This is the best app for listening a music, background,sound quality is awesome, I make a playlist on this app nd it become best ever... ðŸ˜‡",1
"I have been getting error messages whenever I try to share a song. When I am able to share a song, ""unsupported browser"" shows up instead of the song's preview. Please fix this!",0
Why they hell am I getting pop-up ads when I pay you for ad free?,0
Why can't I play radio songs? Lol I clicked a song and another started to play what is happening to this stupid app. And add a quick playlist add button. Waste of money.,0
"Imagine searching for a song and when you play it, it plays another song.",0
Spotify thinks you're too stupid to know what you want to listen to. That's the only conclusion I can come to. For the last several months they refuse to fix a glich that changes the playlist you selected to whatever Spotify thinks you aut to listen to. It's even more fun when it changes your kids play list to something kids shouldn't listen to.,0
I wish they would let u put your play list in alphabetical order. That why I only gave four stars,0
App keeps crashing. Cant even open app. Open and then crash.,0
"Spotify used to be a good app, now it's just full of ads, uninstalled it,very annoying.",0
"I really like it, and it works really well usually, but I've been having glitches where the playing bar dissappears, and I can't pause, or play or skip etc... and it's beyond debilitating",0
"Just to be clear, I downloaded this app for the JRE podcast only. Imagine, we are all sitting in a giant stadium, enclosed, pitch black, dead silent. Out of no where comes the JRE podcast. Like a match flame in this darkness. Everyone one of us can see it. Some choose not to, or deceive others that Joe Rogans light is false. Truth is light. Soon it will affect everyone personally enough to be able to see it differently. And the light that has been there appears to them. Illuminate the darkness.",0
Having a problem with the app today. Unable to stop song while playing. The bottom line disappears,0
It keeps freezing and it doesn't go to the next song,0
great,1
Too much adds,0
I use this app at least 5 hours a day. Great for getting any music or podcast you want.,0
It was so bad when I want to play a song a ad pops up and when the ad finish it changes the SONG,0
Hella irritating. Stopped working out as soon as I flew out of India. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ»ðŸ‘ŽðŸ»ðŸ‘ŽðŸ»,0
Love Spotify-I can pick music thar calms me. Better than going to a bar or a therapy session!!!,0
Fantastic,1
"Excellent catalogue of music, in any genre thought of.",1
Love the app been using it for years now but just recently I've noticed that some songs that are saved im my playlist can't be played at all they're still in my playlist but its been grayed out and skips it completely. Examples the album Dr.Dre and doggystyle from snoop dog some of the songs are grayed out. Plus I've been able to play them b4 now i cant anymore. If someone can explain why that would be very helpful.,0
Great app anytune you Want to hear.,1
Grateful for such a great service,1
Its cool it has podcast that I can't listen to anywhere else over all runs pretty good and easy turn it off it you don't want it on in the background,0
"Too much ads, I got 7 in a row.",0
Dont get this app it spends your data on stupid adds never get itðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,0
"Absolutely terrible app, I have had to re install multiple times and redownload all of the music I want to listen to offline even more. I am now sitting on the train unable to listen to the music I paid for while looking for an alternative. Avoid spotify at all costs.",0
"Great customer service!! App stopped working suddenly and used the chat customer service. Super convenient when I was at work. Was troubleshooting throughout the whole day. Uninstalling, reinstalling, clearing caches, checking with a spotify test profile as well and nothing worked until it finally got resolved. Spotify is the only app I use my phone for besides calling and texting. I honestly didn't get frustrated because they didn't have me repeat myself. spotify addict still here!",0
I used to love this app but after the new update I can barely do anything without premium. It gets really annoying and just makes me want to use it less. Either make it a 100% prescription app or just put it back to normal. Would have rated it five before this.,0
My go to player,1
"I have been experiencing a sudden stop to what am I listening. Several times in the same podcast for example. Also, lately there is an error and I can't see anymore the buttons. I was listening to a playlist, had the music stopped not by me, and had to go back to the same music manually. Or I didn't had the skip the music even visible on my screen.",0
"I pay my money and lately it shuts down, for no apparent reason! Music gives me life, especially when I'm cleaning house... Lol fix the issue please!",0
I absolutely love my Spotify,1
Putting more and more ads in is a pretty sneaky way to force everyone to pay for premium. Why pay for premium when I can just use YouTube music. Not to mention how much faster YouTube music runs for me whereas Spotify just wouldn't load properly sometimes,0
Bad due to ads at sevral time,0
the start is beautiful there were no annoying ads and i cand play back or see the play button.but after few weeks the play button started disappearing and there were many annoying ads everywhere and i cant play the music want to. pls fix this problem,0
It's really good but one thing I can't feel so good that there is no proper new release on the top of all list where I find what is new.One 'new release for me' catagory is here but it is not so perfect allways.I can't find some frequently release songs.So I have to find them by searching them.Why I always have to do this?..............,0
"Great selection, great service, easy to use",1
I pay for this and it's always jacked up and doesn't work right :/,0
Good app for listening music but one problem creates that is sometimes you chose another music to listen in between ads are disturbing to you ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”.....,0
"These idiots didn't process my payment and sent me an email saying my account was paused. 10 minutes after receiving that email, I logged in and resubmitted the same exact payment method and it processed with no problems. I don't understand what the problem was to begin with. Now, I lost all my family plan settings and have to start over. You want to get rid of my business? You freaking got it. I have been a subscriber for many years. Will find another company to do business with.",0
"App has a a flaw and a bug. Flaw: when listening to a podcast and Spotify gets turned off and let's say a couple hours goes by and it's forgotten what you were listening too. Well good luck finding it again unless you added to to a list in advance. I've had to create a listened-too list for this. Not an issue for music, because whatever, but for podcasts this is a huge goof. I should be able to see on one screen the last 100 podcasts I've listened too. Bug: it stops playing. No reason.",0
Max and Full enjoy the rest of this app,1
"The last time I tuned in, it kept flicking from one song to another, and wouldn't let me listen to the song that I wanted to.",1
I love Spotify everything you want and more,1
Plays random music can't decide it on top of that the recommended music is always garbage rap or pop the people in charge clearly don't actively listen to music,0
I dont have a radio in my truck so I use this on my phone.,0
"Accessible, reliable and easy to use",1
Excellent music,1
why remove the feature to listen to some bits of a song when adding songs to ur playlist?? why?,0
Like the app but I don't like is the dumb advertisement,0
I can't choose the song I want nor can I search for a song in the playlist. Horrible app.,0
"Let me disable podcasts on this app that I pay money for, I am NEVER going to listen to them yet they cover half the screen when I open the app. Why is something I've never so much as clicked on the second listing on the home page, right in the center of the screen? Edit 2/3/22 still annoyed by podcasts being in my way",0
I dont pay for a subscription every month to listen to 10 minutes of adds for a 5 minute podcast,0
I am quite pleased with Spotify ðŸ˜Š learned about it from a friend,1
"Spotify still hasn't been fixed, huh?",0
"Now my music app is sending pointless notifications that won't go away even when I check them? First off music apps should not send notifications. Secondly if an app sends notifications thy should have a F-ing point. Finally, they should go away once checked.",0
"Premium user so not sure if that changes my app functionality in any way. Video podcasts are still broken on my LG VELVET 5G, even after updating to Android 12. This has been the case for over two months now. Playing a podcast with video (with all settings set properly) only shows a black screen whether in the player preview or in full screen. Spotify also often locks up or plays something without it showing in the player, essentially ""phantom playing"" media which requires a restart.",0
Very best app. Great. But reduce the ads.,0
I'm hoping it's a great app Hope that I can experience more with this app,1
I have had this app for a couple years now and I have zero complaints so far. Every thing about it is awesome from the sound quality to the graphics. 10/10 recommend!,1
"Parents beware, unless you pay for premium.. I really enjoyed Spotify until an extremely inappropriate ad played while my children were listening, I uninstalled it after that.",0
Continuously asks me for Bluetooth permission that I don't want to give it. Give up already and stop asking me,0
This app is horrible if u play the song that u want it will play a wrong song this is worst app audify better,0
Upgraded to premium duo and could get the app to work correctly. Then it logged me into the account using my email but my wife's username. Every time I log out it pops up showing me logged in as her. Cannot get human help. Fckd up!,0
"The fit is perfect, and the sound is amazing if I could give it 10 stars you'd have it... Amazing product ðŸ‘Œ",1
After two or three song they give a long add which is really anonning .when I use the first there will have add but add remain after the 30 min,0
I appreciate the different cool hers you can create. I hate I can't listen to music or control on my Samsung watch.,1
"I love this app, I listen to music all the time. I like the usual songs but I also like discovering new artists and spotify makes that easy for me.",1
I'm happy and grateful cause all characteristics of songs that I research here I find it,1
"Despite some ocasional crashes, it's an amazing streaming app! I fully recommend it.",1
Can't open the app anymore,0
Tho it was amazing but it still comes up with so many ads..all the time literally just after a song there comes a ad.. I mean i know that advertising is the main point bt atleast don't interrupt between 2 songs.. I m tired ads and ads and ads,0
Terrible performance after the update. Songs won't play or stop at random. Last played songs won't come back after restart. Won't stop playing when headphones are disconnected... total mess,0
"Spotify is really really moreee better then gana app really i suggest you, i too use Spotify in very very low net please download don't go with the abused review........... thanks ...... Ghamsamnida ........",0
Wouldn't recommend any other music app. Brilliant!,0
"This is the best app to listen to for all kinds of music. I love this app so much, it is the best ever.",1
"Apr 2022 player controls disappear. Aug 2021, no longer works with Android alarm clock. What is wrong with you Spotify?! We pay for this service. Test new releases before pushing them to the public.",0
"I like it so much because we can listen songs by different languages and also we can listen podcast by different native speakers by Live performance. So, Thanks a Lot to Spotify ðŸ‘",1
"It's because they ask me: "" how's the app? Rate us!"" That tiny thing hits me up. If I like things I rate it or hit whit thumb.",0
I love Spotify but the no internet connection problem is pissing me off. You don't know how many times I have uninstalled and reinstalled Spotify sometimes it does not login. I have a premium membership because I loved Spotify. My device is samsung m21 2021 edition. Please fix this Spotify. You will get 5 star review after you fix this issue,0
"So you mean to tell me that on order to listen to the songs that I WANT to on mobile and not some random song that will play instead, I am required to pay for Premium? Yeah, no. One star, and going back to YouTube.",0
Too many bugs. I honestly might as well stick to YouTube because I get like 5 ads every 3 songs. The only thing that keeps me using this is the podcast and I have to uninstall and reinstall the app daily just to listen to them,0
I couldn't live without this app! I use Spotify every single day and it works so great! My previous comment was about a small problem I've encountered and it's been fixed very fast. I'd recommend this app to everyone. Buying premium is 100% worth it!,1
The app is good but recently developed an issue where it doesn't let me search songs because it keeps telling me offline.,0
"Serious bugs as at 13/04/22. Liked songs not syncing (major annoyance), playback controls disappearing, songs cutting out mid play. Uninstall and reinstall does not resolve.",0
Spotify groups refuses to work and there's no way to reach customer service for any reason. More upset about the customer service issue.,0
"Overall really great for music and podcasts. I have the paid version, so no ads and it is definitely worth it",1
I ts a very good app for me it's a brilliant we explore very most such a songs but a problem is whenever i go offline the music is stop please fix it but it's a op app for me My regards Yash,1
It's an amazing app i am enjoying alot and while listening music I go in my own imagination ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜it's amazing,1
Simply the most excellent app!,1
Music quality is best. I used ganna and YouTube premium also.,1
"The new update requires me to pay to skip more than 6 songs an hour, I can't play the songs I want, and it's just pure garbage now.",0
I was great then i had to get premium and it stopped working,0
"Until now the app was ok. I learned how to use totally chaotic interface. But after upgrade developers managed to break the app. It is unstable, it will not load lyrics while playing on external device (Rpi) and you cannot close notification when it is not playing. I want to enjoy music without being annoyed by terrible app.",0
It is a very great app for streaming music. It just needs an improvement in its search system just like Youtube.,0
I would give 5 stars but I can't remove a Playlist from my app homescreen that I've only listened to once.,0
Spotify is an Excellent App Period...,1
Lots of ads are coming in song,1
I think it sucks we have to pay for no ads but other than that I love it :),1
"This is being critical. Spotify only cares about business work and profit, it was good until a year then lately nowadays am facing lot of disturbing circumstances through Spotify, it keeps playing songs out of my playlist even tho the automatic play button is off from the settings and I've seen ample of comments about the same problem being faced by people whosharing their experiences in Google and it is not getting resolved until I take their premium membership such things were not expected",0
"Songs has been stopping by itself, doesn't show what's playing and can't be controlled by the car steering buttons anymore.",0
"Way to many completely irrelevant ads. Can't select the artist or album you actually want to hear. But it's good to get an idea of what songs to torrent. Then when the ads start, I turn it off and listen to my torrented music collection ad free.",1
Great app for music and podcasts. Great support for great people. Thank you for not bending the knee to tyrants!,1
Great!! Offline option is awesome,1
For android it doesnt let u press the next to play the next song keeps popping up ads its worthless for android if u need premium to play the next song that's dumb... I'll listen to ads I'll look at ads but forcing ads and not letting me go to the next song that's kinda dumb app version is buggy,0
Wish there wouldn't be so much college adds(there are up to 5!)...other than that this app is amazing.,1
Best music app ever!!!,1
Not a 5 cause i want some deeper picks. But I couldnt live without this app so yea.,0
Love the playlist that ya'll put together!,1
Decent music playing app. But it will bully you into paying for a family account more often than not. I only use it because there isnt much else.,0
"They want to make their podcasts exclusive which forces you to use the spotify app instead of your favorite podcast app you may have been using for years.. Then they give you this garbage half baked tacked on podcast section.. It's so terrible, especially for such a big company.. Are they not capable to do a little market research and see what makes the many best podcasts apps the best... Then they can add many of those standard awesome features to their mess... Get with the program spotify...",0
When you beg for ratings you get bad ones. Also just let me play one specific song.,0
Been with Spotify for years and love their platform and features.,1
"Fantastic when wanting to know about the latest music and singers. As wel as old singers and songs, when u were younger.",1
Needs to be worked on. There are plenty of apps out there that have excellent features but you can't get certain podcasts on them because they're exclusive. So you're forced to listen to an app that acts up and doesn't do what you'd like it to do. And if you pay for premium it doesn't help.,0
GOOD,1
Used to be able to see lyrics while on the free plan and the moment I subscribed for a premium plan I lost the feature :/,0
"Great app, interface and stands up for free speech",1
Good for seeing advertisement,1
"Everything is great, I've purchased premium plan and satisfied with it. But I got a question, ""Will Spotify support Dolby Atmos?"". My phone already supported this feature and I'm waiting for the update of Spotify to add Dolby Atmos feature.",0
Easy to set up good music,1
Worst app now but earlier it was the best,1
Best music streaming app period!,1
Have been more than a satisfied customer now for over 8 years. Thanks Spotify,1
Absolutely the worst user experience. If you unwilling to pay for premium don't bother installing. Sure you may have to download your music through another player but at least you can choose a song to play and not be surprised when the thing you wanted to play WILL NEVER PLAY,0
It works just fine but I don't like how there's no search on home screen ðŸ˜ ðŸ’—,0
"they took away preview on add songs. that became very useful when im searching and making a good playlist, but now i dont know what the songs are so i only add the ones i know.",0
"I love this app but I feel like it's better on a laptop since you could skip the songs without worrying about running out of skips. I would love if this could change and both the mobile and laptop to skipping songs unlimited. Anyways, I love this app and absolutely recommend. And thank you so much to the creators for making this app, this is one of the best music apps I ever used. â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸",1
"Music, comedy, and podcasts whenever I need it.",0
Very good and cool especially when you buy premium,1
"Reimplement filtering by downloaded artists. Stop removing features please, this has been always posible but has been removed dont know when.",0
"Spotify has always been my favorite untill now. I have been on a family plan for a couple years and loyal, and y'all get 95% of my data a month plus the monthly fee & we came to hard times from hurricane Ida. I was invited access again today only to say I can't join but once a year. That's f&_$ed up.",1
Spotify is a near flawless app for all things audio related. The only drawback is that the service doesn't have certain songs available.,1
It easy ad fast to be used,0
Lately there's been some weird glitches and my husband is experiencing them with his too. I can't open the page to see the song that's playing and be able to pause/skip/like the song. I can't skip songs at all even in the car using my cars controlls. Once a song is playing I can't pause it or stop it from playing. I have to close the app manually through my phones settings to stop the music. Too many glitches for an app i pay for. I'm switching to youtube prem If it doesn't get fixed soon.,0
"It's a terrific Music App and the Premium rate is very affordable... Please try to keep it that way. I especially ""Love"" the spin off App ""Stations"". Keep up the Good Work so We All can continue to ""Let The Good Times Roll""... ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸ˜„ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ŽâœŒðŸ˜ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ»ðŸŽµðŸŽ¹ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¸",1
"App is Good, i just didn't liked it's widget. I would love if developers improve its widget's interface/layout, bcoz it looks so simple",1
Many ads but it's a good music streaming appðŸ‘,1
GREAT,1
Excellent all my favourites songs in one place Love it,1
I can't live without spotify ðŸ’š,1
Love Spotify but uhh i can't see the full description of a playlist. Please fix,0
"Nice seeing some recent work for android. Swipe to queue, and love the new squiggle progressbar",1
The app is great. Excellent music selection... but the worst app connection to car radio. My factory radio keeps on misbehave when app connects to it. No more handsfree or usb. Cant even use normal radio. Then have to reset bluetooth connections to radio. Then remove app from phone and then everything works perfect. Reinstall spotify. And radio goes bonkers again..,0
Everything I was told about a music getaway as therapy is right on Spotify.... Can't even lie about it. ðŸŽ§,1
I love listening the old songs here it brings back memories of my younger years.,1
Best,1
Spotify is very good and songs are good i like belupatcho song all songs are very good,1
I love it thats all I want to say,1
"Thrash and getting worse by the day. Stop shoving 'functionality' down our throats, constantly asking for Bluetooth access, and pushing your thrash podcasts",0
"Cannot play individual songs, can't even play an album without the first, and every other song being something completely unrelated. Good for listening to music that you don't want to. What a joke",0
Spotify is an awesome music and podcast app. I have got every song that I have searched for.,1
"Worst app for non premium users, you'll get ad after every song",0
"""Hide"" button doesn't work. I don't recommend an application that doesn't work decently! Not to mom or anyone. Asking 10 times to allow Bluetooth connectivity is really annoying! Seriously, testing this app before releasing any update should help ðŸ™ƒ Useless... even worse! ðŸ˜¡ Going back to Limewire.",0
"Great song database, but free plan offers nothing (when you compare it to YouTube Music free plan). I love that the lyrics feature is finally here!",0
"It always complain no internet connection whereas my net is already working for other apps. It was so frustrating,please check with your networking code backside what outdated protocol they must be using",0
Very useful and very nice application,1
Garbage. Too bad it's the only option. When selecting offline playback takes forever to open for some reason. Periodically the audio starts and stops for no reason. Works perfectly if the screen is on. Problem persists through several updates.,0
I have been using premium for over 3 years now and it's the best app you'll get for music and podcast,1
This to me is the best app on any phone. I use this app all the time from playing very soft music to playing classic rock and roll,1
I give this app a 1 because there is a problem i always click on a song and put another it is so bad,0
"The worst experience I ever had, unfortunately. Not friendly, hardly can navigate and get the logic.",0
"I've had this app for years and now all it does is crash either 80% done a song, or immediately at song change.",0
Spotify is always on time,0
I tried several apps for music so far it's far this is tied with the paid version of YouTube music,0
It is a good platform for music when u get premium and higher quality sound,1
Awsome app realy amazing layout super easy to listen and play music highly recomended,1
I love spotify. The most recent update however will not work for me. I have premium and the lyrics do not work. I've reinstalled and etc. The songs list lyrics but will not show them. I've tried the help page suggestions as well.,0
Music none stop all day everyday paying worth every dollar and coin.,1
"I have had spotify for years, the random pausing is getting annoying though, I hope it gets fixed soon",0
Can u remove the shaffle that we can pick songs if we connect to a device or we play on our phones,0
Spotify is one of the best streaming apps. Every time I look up a song spotify has it and you can also listen to varieties of podcasts.,1
Spotify's probably just a little bit better than YouTube music because I can cut my phone off and it still plays my music,1
"I have the free version, and the sheer amount of ads I get is actually ridiculous. I understand needing ads, but it's happened to me where I got hit with 6 ads (each lasting a minute), only for it to play one or two songs, followed by 6 more ads. I'm listening to more ad time then I am music at this point. And on the rare occasion I get the 30 minutes of ad free music, it plays 3 songs, then the ads start up again.",0
Most music when you want it,1
Great. Selection is outstanding and so varied. Ps. I pay for no interruptions.,1
Worst music app honestly. Keeps logging me out almost everyday.,0
It calms me down. I listen to music I enjoy while at dialysis. Thank you,1
Good choice and good service,1
One,1
If you have premium than only you can use it,1
I will give 5 stars if you guys add the shortcuts with volume keys to skip tracks on the Galaxy s22 Ultra. Please add!!!,1
Latest update is super glitchy. Song controls suddenly just disappear.,0
â¤ï¸ Spotify since 2018 BUT Updates broke previously working functionsðŸ˜­ðŸ˜¡. Phone app functions < +more complicated than desktop. Hard to find my own regular playlistsðŸ˜­. Cant clear searchesâ˜¹ï¸. App settings INCLUDING likes + follows doesnt sync between devices!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜­. Apps stopped registering different devices playing ðŸ˜¡ðŸ¤¬(mobile and/or desktop) - only registers devices on web app nowðŸ¤¬ to allow switches to different device speaker- if you wanted to. Disappointed Spotify!â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸ðŸ‘Ž,0
After a while of having it I've grow found of it. I would rate this 5 stars but there's one problem. The fact that the app won't play whats on my created Playlist Please fix this and I will rate this app 5 stars,0
I enjoy spotify.every song I want it right here,1
"Worst app ðŸ‘Ž , contain lots and lots of advertisements",0
"I hate this new update. How am I a premium member and I cannot enjoy it? As soon as my screen locks, my music stops playing until I unlock my phone, then it continues playing. Which is rubbish. Please fix this.",0
Nice,1
More adds,1
"best app for songs explore, makes u listen new n good songs, it's algorithm is too good for next song. Better than gaana or saavn etc apps.",0
I love listening to music when I work read and draw. I love Spotify and the podcast,1
It is a nice app but there is a problem that we can not download songs form it,0
Great app,1
"This app is terrible, I can't listen to any album without it adding a random song in between it. There are far too many ads. A money hungry app if you ask me.",0
Excellent range of music available.Always something worth listening too!,1
Can find varieties/category songs as we need,1
LOVER,1
"Ofc 5 stars, amazing app, no glitches. Keep it up team !",0
Getting sick of Spotify and I've been premium for years. But will disconnect completely if app not working properly. Can't play intermittent music without have to switch off and restart the phone constantly. I'm sick of it ðŸ˜’.,0
Nothing is comparable to this app. Whenever you feel whatever it's always with you. Thanks for creating such a beautiful app that works with every emotion you have . love this app. It's the one which always with me .,1
The free version is great. Just make alot of playlists with a couple songs on it... (Will let you choose which songs you want to hear!) The ads are a little irritating though especially if you're trying to sleep.The paid subscription is very nice and will allow you to listen to most songs (all in the order you want) the only thing that would make it five star is a couple artist's albums aren't on it. Overall amazing.,0
App keeps randomly stopping music and the app appears to freeze,0
It has become the most useless. No song has been playing for some days,0
"Been a premium member for over a year. Love the app but after the last update It quit fully connecting to the head unit in our cars (wife's did the same thing) music still comes through but it always says ""connecting""... Has to be controlled exclusively by the phone which really defeats the purpose of using it",0
"I've been using Spotify for years and I love it! It's super easy to navigate. But as of late the lyrics have stopped showing up on songs, from my understanding it's a glitch in the app but maybe I'm wrong. Another issue I've had, like many other's, is the ads. There are way too many and they put them in way too often.",0
Way better than Pandora! Loving this app!,1
App quite working after last Samsung update on 5-13-22. Not happy had all my music with you and have nothing yet. Before this I have been very happy andno thinking of upgrading. But if I can't depend on you I will have to look elsewhere.,0
"Premium user. March 2022 update broke the app. It constantly crashes if I open playlists that contain local files and sometimes even with normal playlists. I've uninstalled & reinstalled, cleared all data / cache - it is still crashing. Sometimes it crashes even when I click on library. I also factory reset my phone. The only thing that sometimes stops the crashing is if I log out then log back in via Facebook but after an hour or so it starts crashing again. Worked fine before update. Fix it",0
"I like the app very much nice playlists for every mood but problem is there is no option for the recently heard songs . So ,please add the option of recently heard by the update.",0
I have premium but it still wont let me download songs for some reason,1
"Many users are complaining, including me, that the part of the application which controls the music disappears after a while. It is such a fundamental problem that it should have been fixed in a day!",0
I absolutely love spotify but almost everytime i switch to a new song it crashes which mwkes me sad if you fix it I'll change my rating,0
Down on stars. Pause/play stops working. Keeps pauseing whatever I'm playing,0
The best app for Spotify,1
Best song app all over,1
"It's not bad but not really good because it only has 6 skips an hour which is very low and you can only play song on shuffle. If I could play songs in any order I want,had more skips,it played song in my playlist not ones that aren't and it didn't have ads after 3 or 4 song,then the rating would be higher but until then it stays as a 2.",0
It's a very good app to hear music,1
It's been fine up until the last week or two. Playing a song starts it but the UI doesn't show its playing. Android auto also keeps showing errors all of a sudden and not working.,0
Exceptionally good but sometimes slow to open.,1
"Been using the app until yesterday, im trying to renew my subscription using M-Pesa but it is not going through. I don't know what's up!",0
"Select shuffle play ""Liked Tunes"" results in tunes That are NOT in my liked list (many would he on a hate list)... Sometimes immediately or sometimes after 1 2 or 3 liked tines. Time to uninstall this poor app",0
"App is good, just when you have premium and you still get to add some listening to podcast is the issue.",1
Absolutely satisfied. I would usually download music to my memory card until I found out about Spotify. All my fave songs from the 80s and 90s are all in here. I have strongly recommended this app to my colleagues and all have shared the same sentiments... Awesome!,1
Great app I enjoy listening to podcasts and audio books including my favorite songs,1
"It won't let me play any playlist are songs and it won't let me look or even listen to my life songs. I've tried on still on, I've been rain still on a I have tried logging out and logging back in, and I even tried making a new account, but it still won't let me listen to any music. I am very confused and I just updated the app and nothing has worked. Spotify used to be my favorite app to use tell us new music, and now I want people to listen tothe music I had liked on this app anymore.",0
"Has all good songs but it always gives me ""suggested songs"" its really annoying and i always hate all the songs they suggest",0
Awesome experience. Love the new playlist . Happy vibez,1
Spotify has provided the best music experience I could ask for. Each update to the app has been great. If you don't have it you should.,1
"This is an awesome app. Never had a problem with it I get story's that are relevant to me an what I like. The music, the story's an the inspirational programs are Top Shelf...enjoy YOUR Spotify !!!",1
I love Spotify don't get me wrong but the new update drives me crazy I can't click on the song I want to listen to any more. I have to go search the song but then it still is on a random play and I still can't listen to the song I want to.,0
"After months of not being able to get a premium account because it comes with a free month which I don't qualify for because I live in QuÃ©bec, I finally found a way to purchase one. Love it!! Finding so many songs from my youth and rare live versions which I prefer.",0
"I love almost everything about Spotify! The only thing I have an issue with is when you are online and another person that is on your Spotify account is online. You can't listen on separate devices. You can change the music or podcast, but it will change theirs also. So you can only listen to one device at a time online. That is the only issue I have and I have had Spotify for many years and will continue to have it for many years to come.",0
My Spotify app is closing automatically when I open and playing the song WT should I do now,0
"The latest update is driving me insane! Bring back the X in the notification bar to CLOSE IT OUT or the PAUSE and SWIPE to CLOSE IT OUT. It stays on even when linked apps and the main app are closed. Makes it next to impossible to use voice to text, etc. From 5 to 1 stars in one update. Fix it ASAP!!",0
It's too easy to use app. I'm obsessed.....,0
Best music plat form,1
"I'm in love with this app this app is mind-blowing ðŸ˜ðŸ™ƒ means u can listen every types of songs like pop songs, k-pop song and every song u want means whenever I listen my fav. songs I feel like yup I came to a right app one of my fav app ðŸ˜ even there is all songs of BTS ðŸ’œ and blackpink ðŸ–¤ðŸ’– except their song I didn't want anything ðŸ˜™ thnku Spotify",1
Impressed with the collectionS... I search many songs based on my mood and I m really happy to hear what I want. Great job by the Spotify team...,1
Hey can you add the feature to move songs up and down in a playlist trust me it gets frustrating when you cannot play your favourite songs one after other when you add new songs. The desktop version has it so why the smartphone doesn't have the feature. If you add the feature 5 stars from me.,0
"all the songs are available and the sound quality also great, the data useage is less in the this app but the ads are awfull!!!!!",0
Best music app EVER! Worth paying for Premium!,1
So many songs there have only been a small handful I can't find or a certain version. Sometimes a song is taken off which sukc cause it was the only on there. Up to 1561 songs and still climbing. Love it,1
It so nice to listen to your own favorite songs and lyrics tooðŸ˜Š,1
Playing/Status bar just disappears and I have to manually force close app and restart every timr,0
It's taking long time while searching songs... And don't all song collection... Very very disappointed,0
Worst experience. Because of irritating ads. After playing 1 song so many ads. Spotify is not a music app. Spotify is a ads app,0
It shuffles when i DONT WANT IT TO  IT DRIVES ME INSANE AND WHEN I WANT IT TO SHUFFLE it does a HORRIBLE JOB shuffling IT NEVER PICKS SONGS THAT I HAVENT HEARD IN FOREVER BUT PLAYS SONGS OVER  OVER  OVER ITS FREE BUT IT DRIVES MY INSANE TOO LONGTO QUE TUNES DRIVES ME NUTS BUT LOVE IT TOO,1
App was working fine until a few days ago. Now it wont show the music play controls. Have to constantly restart the app to get it to work properly. Yall need to fix this asap.,0
Very good in my opinion. Switched from YT Music and wasn't disappointed. I recommend.,1
"New phone and my account didn't save and or cross over, lost all my play lists.......unsatisfactory!!!",0
Very good you can make a play list for free and it don't drain your battery like you tube,1
"Great app for playing music, although when I search up a song I want to play, after all the adverts have played, I have to skip through multiple different songs and sometimes I don't have enough skips to get to the song I want so most of the time I go on yt and play it because I can't be bothered waiting for songs i don't know to finish playing!",1
"If you download stuff for offline listening it often does not play properly always freezing, still need service to load the app to even get to the downloads. Kinda ridiculous.",0
"Tried others music providers ,yet now I see why Spotify is the benchmark that the others try to replicate. Keep it this way, not overpriced so everyone can subscribe again keep it this way",1
"No way to switch off anymore, either you endlessly listen to music or it stops on its own in the middle of say a meditation - both options are unwanted!",0
"At first I really liked this app I could play music I like and it was good then after short amount of time I could only shuffle and I was only premium will fix this, I would rather stick to YouTube if I have to pay.",0
Ive been using Spotify for a while now and Im impressed with the extensive music library and easy-to-use interface The personalized playlists and recommendations have introduced me to some amazing new artists and songs The ability to create and share playlists is fantastic and the offline listening feature comes in handy when Im on the go My only minor gripe is the occasional ads in the free version but overall Spotify delivers an excellent music streaming experience Highly recommend,1
This is the best app for listening music in online and there is a problem of ads its so irritating by the way i like this app,0
great application,1
Works great I use it everyday Enjoying the new feature of audiobooks Would give 5 stars if it didnt feel like the same songs were played even with shuffle mode on,1
"Bugs, bugs and bugs... 1. Notification player widget disappeares all the time 2. Often I can't like the song, I press the heart and it says ""Added to liked"" but nothing happens 3. Sometimes the volume suddenly drops like a 50% and when I kill the app and open it again it comes back to normal level",0
Ratio way off Every two songs I been listening to have been followed by 3-4 ads.,0
amazing,1
The queue just doesn't work,0
Vere cofartable and very clear sound I like very much,1
I like it because it makes you watch music,1
"Going to be honest, I have had to listen to the same ad for the tenth time in a row now, and that is after every song, there is way to many ads to enjoy my favourite songs",1
"Really love this app, been using premium for a while now. But what happened to the option of moving the app into external storage? It used to have that option in the settings and now its not there",0
"It's always been a good app until the last 2 or 3 months. I see all the other complaints and mine are pretty much the same... Music control bar just disappears, also music stops sometimes but more often it just randomly starts some song I listened to weeks ago one time and now it's like an default, when my truck Bluetooth connects it plays this stupid song or worse yet another song by that artist that I've never played. Spotify needs to respond here, so we know they're taking this seriously.",0
Excellent! Amazing range of music! Truly fantastic experience.,1
I am enjoying the crime podcasts to an extreme. Just wish there were more of them.,1
This is the best music player i've ever used.It has a good quality of playing music and you can have access to all kinds of music that you want.,1
Cannot get to stop playing in the background. Canceling and uninstalling,1
Some it shows some network problems. So I can't hear music when I need ðŸ˜”,0
I keep watching the ad for 30 minutes but only getting like 15 please fix this,0
App crashes all the time,0
"Only problem is after I watch the ad for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music, I only hear 1 song before I hear more ads",0
Superb app it prefer songs on what type of songs we are listening Loved it,1
Best music app out. Way better than Apple music,1
This app is amazing i can't explain it that good,1
This app is very good and very comfortable to use you can also see lyrics and sound experiance is very good and there is no risk for hacking i have 6 years experience for spotify,1
Easy to use. Wide range of music and podcast.,1
"Easy and fast, loads of selections",0
"Total trash, i accidentally clicked shuffle and now I can't even turn it off this is the worst app ever.",0
"Love the app but have issues with songs stopping abruptly once in awhile. Can't do anything to fix it, just have to wait awhile for everything to play correctly.",0
Very good experience every time,1
"It's so irritating, this should be a state of the art app, and it is when it works, but it's constantly crashing, the controls keep disappearing, it turns off randomly, and it's unchanged since the latest update. Do better Spotify.",0
"Latest update has nuked functionality, stop messing with what works.",0
I love everything about this but the ads!,1
Great platform that I've been using for years. I can get almost everything that I'm looking. All my music anywhere I go. Radio based on ... great for discovering more new music.,1
"Can't pause anything anymore, I have to close the whole app.",0
Not able to login in mobile. It's showing Error.,0
I'm experiencing some problems since then but spotify team isn't responding to any of my complaints email. This is not the first time it happened.,0
Mobile Spotify sucks. I can never listen to the songs I want to listen to without a different song popping up out of nowhere.,0
This app only let's me skip a few times and I can't add the song I want anymore so 1 star,0
as a music enthusiast  i love spotify but it gets even better if you subsribe to premium plan as for those who dont subscribe these user  which was me as well  experience lots of unskipable ads and i hope spotify would please at least lessen the amount the premium plan is affordable and worth it as well as the experience its giving is incredible your songs may be uninterrupted and you can enjoy your artists without any barriers D ,1
"Awesome App,enjoy it yall will love it.",1
"Spotify is amazing! you can find your favorite songs and add them to your own playlist.If you get premiume you can download song, there are podcasts to relax and listen too :) Have fun! <3",1
"Been away for a bit, app got worse! I seriously don't get how this can happen. Every time I open the app I get stuck in the ad loops! Like seriously how many ads do I have to listen to. I have to close the app and reopen it. Talk about making it so u subscribe. I'll definitely be finding another app. Horrible!",0
Love music,1
"This may be worse than youtube music as far as music apps go, i just want one specfic song and cant even play that cause it puts it in a play list like dude i dont care about your recommendations just let me play the song i specifically looked up",0
Shite app very slow keeps saying I don't have an Internet connection when I do can't believe I pay for this shite,0
Still the worst app on my phone. Playback stops all the time. Downloads take forever. If it wasn't for Joe Rogan I'd definitely never use this app,0
"I'll give five stars again but after this update it's buggy as hell. Now playing bar never shows up, freezes, (Update: fixed ) Update: lyrics don't show up when casting to a Spotify connect device!",0
This is honestly therapy whenever I just feel anxious going on Spotify and playing music helps this is an awesome app,1
"Im really excited with every music on spotify. Im really happy that i can get old stuff to the latest. I enjoy this app to the fullest, thanks once more",1
Good app but the ads make me wanna shove a 69 foot pole down my ear.,0
Best app,1
Constantly stops or needs restarting,0
Love it but the little skips,0
"The new update is total brutal. For starters, when, I'm trying to listen a song, I can't click the song I wanted in the library. Second, I can't skip there's a maximum number of skips in each hours, and third of all there's ads if you wanna listen to a song AND YOU CAN'T CLICK NEXT IF YOU LISTENING TO THE SONG. WHAT HAPPEND!? Who thought this will be a good update? You can only listen to the song a short amount of seconds, I don't understand why this is a good update. Clearly, IT'S NOT.",0
"App is showing ""No Internet connection"" aftwr android 12 update when connected on mobile network.",0
"I have love this app ðŸ’—, this app is the best app I have use it is so good and very much easy to use . I will recommend to all to use this best music streaming app.",1
This is a AMAZING app and I feel that it has all of the songs I ever want to play and I am glad I downloaded it.,1
Great choice of music with wide range of genres.,1
"Spotify literally holds your offline content hostage (it can be downloaded and they just randomly say songs can't play) and doesn't let sleep timer work, unless you go online every few days. I have cleared cache repeatedly, uninstalled, etc per Spotify's ""help"" but it does nothing to resolve issue. Problem is with the app, but they refuse to take responsibility or fix it. Seems like their way of forcing you online sooner so they can track you (supposed to be every 29-30 days). Terrible service",0
Great app to listening to all kinds of music without having to use YT and kill bandwidth,1
"I can give more stars to this app, howeber, it is crashing FREQUENTLY, both on my 2 phones and sometimes even through my web browser. As a premium user for more than 3 years now, it is my pet peeve that on my liked songs, DUPLICATE songs are displayed. Also, I wish there were updates that can allow users to comment on podcasts ðŸ˜­",0
Was good now it's painful. Constantly just stops most annoyingly while in the car. Also randomly turns on at the most awkward times. The play bar disappears so you cannot continue you have to start again meaning listening to the same songs over and over. Fix the bug!,0
Spotify brings back my memories wen I was small 6 years ago I used to download Spotify nd use VPN it was the time wen it was not supported in India I'm in love' with Spotify u guys r best u guys gve me happiest vibe i feel in songs thank u nd who ever made Spotify love u maaaaannnn,1
It's a fantastic app for music lovers that means for all,1
"It crashes about 2 days after each update starting to get on my nerves. Update on my review, I am currently looking for a new way to listen to podcasts. App always malfunctioning. Not one Update or anything to correct it. Cheers Spotify. I'm having to delete and install the app multiple times a day, so I can listen to more than 15 minutes of a podcast. This is BS",0
This app sucks they force you to get premium so you can hear the actual song you wanna listen to but if you dont have premium you hear kids songs,0
"It's great n all but it has an issue when I'm using it,it only has the logo and it won't open I hope you guys fix this.ðŸ˜",0
Better than any music streaming service I can look up any song on here and it has it While other apps dont have near as many songs as Spotify definitely worth getting,1
ITS BEST I AM A YOUTUBER CHANNEL NAME NOT BLUE LION AND I LIKE LISTENING ENGLISH SONG AND MYTHPAT PODCAST MORE THIS IS BEST APP TO LISTEN MUSIC YOU CAN GET ALL SONGS WHICH ARE PRESENT IN OUR PLANET LOL BUT YA THERE ARE A LOT'S OF SONG IN THIS APP YOU SHOULD LISTEN EM ALL THANKS ðŸ˜Š,1
would be cool if lyrics can be saved offline too..,0
"App does not function properly, and is nowhere near complete. For instance, when I was on iOS, I was able to swipe on the player to bring it down, such a gesture control does not exist in Android, as far as I can tell. Let's also not forget the app REFUSES to keep playing similar music after my song ends, with the option enabled. Also I DONT CARE ABOUT PODCASTS. Ads were a joke without prem too. Update: about a year later, app still does not function properly. Even after reinstall.",0
The pause play bar has gone missing! Please can this be looked at. Perhaps something weird in the last update?,0
My experience with Spotify is just great! Thank you Spotify for everyday.,1
I love listening to the music I like on this app ^^,1
My favorite music app. Love the integration withany other apps and services and the variety it offers.,1
Great for finding music I missed or had forgotten,1
After premium goes away it becomes so hard to use and isn't user friendly,0
"Somehow my favourite tracks are hidden in one of my playlists (which I never did) and I can't unhide them. I have switched on ""Show unplayable songs"" in my settings but the ""Hidden"" Button is still broken. Please fix this, I'm paying money for this app each month.",0
constantly crashing. for a paid app it doesn't work half the time.,0
Great app easy to use.,1
Stupid app suddenly stops working correctly and goes from being able to listen to albums and choose songs specifically off of an album to it just playing randomly and not letting you listen to full albums anymore. I wish I knew why the free account did this.,0
Great app to listen to any type of music,1
"Current songs playing won't show up. I can't skip, pause or even see what song is playing. Please fix this. **Edit: 4/15 update** How is the app STILL broken after the update? Is this a joke?",0
"Glitchy app, could be a lot more user friendly. But good library of songs if you can deal with finesse'ing your way around it from time to time",1
Excellent music choses and very good quality for the price,1
"Didn't have any problem with free trial version. Until I subscribed to premium since 2 years ago and the lyrics won't show up in any device idk why. Tried reinstalling, updating, clearing cache for MONTHS. Nothing works..",0
An amazing experience of songs on Spotify.,1
When i first installed ur app..it worked fine with my bluetooth speaker! Now it dont play at all with same speaker. Its like spotify dont play at all anymore! You tube plays just fine.,1
The music you can find any kind of music oldies Blues Music back into the seventies sixties,1
Jaishreeram Bahut achha app hai Mai to bolta hu app bhi istmaal karo,1
Very self explanatory. Understandable. Has everything,1
My one stop shop for all music ðŸŽ¶ What a joy and comfort app... no more CD's and memory cards...forever! ðŸ¤£,1
FAV,1
Its all good except for the numerous ads.i think there should be an option for never ask again so we don't have to hear those premium ads but still have the option to subscribe regarding the premium thing,1
"All my favourite music I can listen to in one place. Easy to make playlists. Never had any issues with Spotify so far. Best way to discover new, underrated music.",1
Ada are not related to anything I'd be interested in at all but with premium the app is amazing.,1
"Since the last update the app has been playing up, I can't pause the songs or stop them, if my phone rings when I'm listening to music then it keeps playing the music during the call, and I can't stop it without turning my whole phone off. Please fix it quickly otherwise I'm going to unsubscribe.",0
"I am just missing some songs , There are not available . Please make them available as soon as possible . Otherwise the app is great and dashing in the music quality !",1
"It's a very good music app hower, when I add songs to my playlist it adds some recommendations which I don't like so maybe add a setting where you could change that and when I try to listen to a song that isnt in my playlist instead I listen the whole playlist not the song.Overall it's a good app just these that let me down.",0
It would be very helpful if spotify could start providing reasons for why it can't play certain things randomly. This app screws up enough that it should start telling you why its malfunctioning,0
Good music on spotify,1
"I rate a 5, my only ask if they could expand the 30 mins inti 45 mins or so.",0
I was not satisfied with the update. It's not just the same as before.,0
Spotify won my heart in Feb 2024 You won my heart With music and lyrics and then language educational podcasts and audio books you finally won my heart over With just a free trial and I was convinced I found what I have been looking for all these while and finally settling down with this like marriage haha,1
Great app for all musice,1
The new update is honestly terrible. Listening on a remote device doesn't work at all anymore and sometimes the skip and pause interface just disappears. Please ffs fix it!!,0
"Easy to use, good recommendation so far.",1
I listen to music all the time on Spotify and I've never had trouble I recommend!,1
Need to add more songs in que but the best best best thing is which is unique about this app that there is no any interruptions advertisement free app keep going on guys like this awesome. We hope will not facing the ads interruptions in this app in future,1
"Only gets this rating because I have premium, with premium it's the best thing on the planet and without it sucks",0
There are some egregious podcasts unfortunately.,0
"I loved this app as soon as i downloaded it . Its now giving a lot of issues. Like , i cant choose the songs i wanna listen to, i cannot even skip the song i dont wanna listen to . I go to shuffle to play the full version and it plays a song i did not even bother to choose. I think its unfair to those who cant go to premium because i cannot be paying every month , its useless. I dislike this app now. I wont waste my time going to premium. I hate this premium, so unfair.",0
"After the update and after it charged me the app wont play any songs, wont load another page and plus all my liked song have disappeared, 5 to 6 years worth of liked songs, i would like them back please, ive always had premium",0
"Awsm app ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ It shows all lofi songs also, it's great ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ & Also unplugged album song â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸",1
"In the past year I've noticed this app getting worse and worse on several occasions logging me out of my account, not loading, crashing at random times, and other things I hope you fix this app to how it was before",0
"All good, but theres one small error which literally defeats the purpose od this app. While listening to music the audio cuts out for 2 seconds or so and continues playing after that. It isnt an ad, it just cuts out and it happens every 3-4 minutes, and its so god damn frustrating.",0
No one is available to assist with my premium account that was stolen. I really like the music platform but customer service sucks only bots.,0
Love this app it's great for all music and I love music so much,1
"I really liked the app, and I still use it close to every day, also in my car. I liked the car mode where I could actually see which song was on, and I could change tracks easily and fast. Now it doesn't exist any more, making the use of the app all the more unsafe while driving. It's such a shame. Please bring the car mode back (keep in mind us old car users with an fm transmitter).",0
"Great app. Great choice in music. Lots of content, lots of views, and no music artists that once supported free speach, and now do not.",1
Install to listen adds,1
"Very happy with Spotify so far,I'm a new user,really like the service ðŸ‘",1
"A couple days ago the play button on the now playing screen moved to the far left and the previous/next buttons are in the middle. I hope thus is a bug, because if this is an intentional change someone needs to be fired, seriously a chimp could design a better UI. This NEEDS to be fixed",0
It is alright but as soon as the premium runs out it sucks because if you try to play a song you searched up you just get some other song instead of what you clicked on so basically you have to pay to listen to the music that you want also it now sometimes refuses to give me my six skips per hour because I used it yesterday and today used three skips and it said that I have used my six skips also not to mention it now gives me almost three ads in one ad and the thirty minutes don't work anymore,0
Really great app. I like that it now has lyrics for most of the songs and it has 95% of the songs I look for.,1
"Literally have been using spotify for ever and I will not be changing that but it's been weird the past week, the music keeps fading out and pausing randomly",0
"It's sound put quality not good, it's not used friendly , didn't find for Tamil 90s Mohan Hits songs . Just seen only",0
Brilliant range of music. A must for all,1
"It's A Really Good Music App, Not The Best One But In Like The Top 3 Lol...",1
I personally enjoy Spotify I really do suggest it when no other apps let you create long Playlist Ive been with Spotify for some time,1
"@Todd byers if you see this message check your fading time in settings,it's adjustable you can change it to zero so the songs don't fade into each other message me if u need help n.p... awesome thank you has enabled me to put mixes together that i couldn't elsewhere... and I just found the insta mixes generated by our listening sessions! Dude that is awesome, I especially love the personalized news and music mix wow, You have done a great work with this app thank you!...GRAEGAN...",1
Great songs in good quality,1
To much advertising and most of the music it play ain't even on my list it's just a headache when i want to hear my music.,0
I have a Samsung S21 ultra. Is there some reason this app likes to randomly stop during playback of like songs? Even after force stopping these app & clearing the cache?,0
"Great music, outstanding service. I use it when traveling and I keep my mind at peace.",1
What could be the reason that it suddenly started to show every playlist empty? It worked well before. I even reinstalled it once but it doesn't help.,0
"I am using Spotify from last 1.5 years. But recently (1 week) whenever I am playing anything on spotify, the app just closes automatically. Developers please help.",0
I love that I can be on a defrent app at the same time and listen to music which is pretty cool,1
"It's a very good app! I can always enjoy my favorite song, but when u have to get premium and you can't. then its not fun at all!! I always get frustrated when I have to put my phone down on a table but it can't go off because if my phone goes off then the song goes off as well. It's irritating. But it's a good app. We'll done âœ”",1
Great to be able to play favourite music on demand.,1
"I love spotify and I don't really have a problem with commercials but, seriously 1 song, 3 adds..?! And then 2 songs, 5 adds.. very annoying",0
Spotify is amazing because its like a world of music. When you like songs or listen to a catagory of songs for awhile it gives you a recconmended and puts songs from the genures you like! I would give this app 5 stars!,1
Stop making the worst decisions. Stop removing every convenient feature. This app gets worse and worse.,0
"Takes some getting used to as far as searching and saving, but very user-friendly.",1
Spotify is awesome. I have premium and it is so helpful I love this way better than other music apps.,1
A idea for Spotify: Imagine being able to choose the years of your favorite singers activities and just listen to the period of songs produced in those years. I hope can see this option soon in the Spotify,1
"Last update made the Bluetooth connection terrible, sometimes my music stops playing and after 2 seconds it comes back. Sometimes I'm connected to my car and randomly stops. Sometimes I'm using my phone speakers and stops.",0
I have been using Spotify for probably 10 years now and upgraded to premium maybe 8 years ago. I've been very happy with it! I wouldn't even using another music streaming service.,1
"Media buttons disappear after a while, so you lose control of the app. Please fix this bug as soon as possible, as it leaves the app unusable.",0
After last update. Spotify will randomly stop playing. The now playing bar at the bottom of screen dissappears. I have to force stop app and restart. This happens multiple times a day. Please look into this. It could have to do with the 4.1 samsung update also. Think it was around the same time the issues started. Thank you,0
Almost perfect. I'm having issues with my payment. Please I need this fixed ASAP. I have tried everything,0
This apps is cool,1
"Spotify, your app isn't working like it used to. It's a century to open a playlist, and even with my cell phone open waiting to open, I didn't open it. I can't hear my playlist anymore.In addition to not being able to add more songs and I can't listen to other songs.Please I really like you. Fix it.",0
"On my s20 fe , the app loves to disengage activity on bluetooth with my ford sync making me have to end the app through settings with force stop. Music will play and become unchangeable in the app or from my car as well as when I disconnect (getting out of my truck) it will endlessly play on the phone until I do so. I used to love the feature of it having a widget on my lock screen and my drop down menu but for some reason it doesn't exist anymore, at least on my phone. Idk, been here since 2016",0
Still randomly turns on for no reason. I don't understand how this hasn't been fixed. The other UI issues that are going on shows how quickly Spotify is going downhill.,0
"There's always something wrong with this app! It's either stopping, action buttons inactive, can never pull up my music when I search my liked songs. Do better!",0
"Best music app ive been able to find. This being said, the small amount of skips and the inability to listen to individual songs are annoying- I would recommend the pc or tablet version more",0
"Great selection of artists and songs, don't exactly know where the shuffle play went though ðŸ¤”.",0
No widget and no option to pause or reverse,0
"So many problems with player, randomly stops, often doesn't show player etc",0
Out of pocket wit the bugs n crashes ðŸ¤• change it asap I miss the ole spotify,0
"My app has crashed consistantly every single day, for 2 and half months. I've had premium for longer than that. Why is it happening? Why is it happening every single day? UPDATE: SPOTIFY has decided to remove the capability to shuffle and repeat if you don't have premium, even for songs downloaded on my phone, from sources that are not Spotify. So now your desperate enough for money that you remove BASIC FUNCTIONS from your music player? Why would I want to use a half working app? Disgusting",0
i give it a five star because has my favorite music from tiktok and from my favorite artist too :),1
INSANE,1
"Really frustrating on Android (s20+). The playback controls just disappear. It randomly just keeps playing on phone when Bluetooth disconnects from vehicle, and then you can't pause because there are no controls. I've tried a reset of phone, reset, update on app...and this continues to happen. It's a basic aspect of the app that should never have a problem like this. Spotify lite works better, but lacks many features that I would like. I'm going to change services if this keeps happening.",0
I love it it has so many great features I just wish that when I set my song on single repeat that it would stay on single repeat when I select another song,1
I like to be able to open app and my songs be there,1
"It's just nice to listen to music and not have it turn off when you ex out, but you have to pay for no adds which absolutely sucks ðŸ˜” therefore I m taking of 1 star",0
"Great, I Have no complaints or issues so far",1
Easy to use and tons of music,1
Great music choice. Admittedly can't find everything I want like classics I used to listen to in my teenage years but still great music. Keep it up ðŸ¤˜ðŸ‘,1
Don't pay the 10 bucks it's not worth it. My music always stops playing at the most random times and it's been happening a little more often lately. This is really starting to irritate me.,0
Nice,1
I love this app,1
"The free version of Spotify was awesome until the new update you can only do six skips an hour and can't pick specific songs. It's horrible, I'm switching back to YouTube music.",0
Another bloatware app that never closes and runs in your backround! Uninstall!,0
The easiest way ive been able to listen to all my favourites and continue to find more music as im not good at remembering the titles and all that so i love spotify.,0
"The last 4, wait 5, updates have made the app run slowly or stop and reset while in offline mode. It use to run really smoothly. 12 hours later and my app is freezing...",0
This app has all the song (even the ones i don't remember ) wow!!,1
"After OS update, 1. playback stops randomly. 2. Does not seem to even show progress in UI several podcast episodes later. 3. Premium account refuses to play downloaded albums. (Playlist worked)",0
New user but happy one Gr8t to get playlist 5****,1
This app is so amazing...it helped me while studying with music and I love the features of this app I loved this app so much and tq...,1
Bro remove the suggested song it's so annoying,0
The ads come up after each songs and I'd prefer spotify to have lyrics. Besides that it's great. â˜ºðŸ™,1
This app is really amazing to listening a song ðŸ˜ƒ,1
"Normally I adore spotify. But it has been bugging out for the past month. I am constantly having to restart the app to change songs. The whole song bar will disappear. Sometimes when i have no internet, i cant get into my DOWNLOADED playlists!!! Also, I even deleted the app and downloaded it again. Still not better. Please fix the bugs! Thank you.",0
"Best music app to date, the algorithm studies your choices to curate the best music suited for you",1
Very poor when offline,0
You are well and have a few minutes late to me so that we have not heard anything back from Facebook you send a private listing you send me that would we will and stop by your family and friends and stop receiving this message and have been in e and stop by to you soon with a good idea to me that you and stop receiving this email is ready you and have not heard from PayPal and stop by your team and your team is ready and stop time and consideration sincerely and fraternally bro I'm going to tour,0
It's is wonderful to have access to music at anytime and by your favourite artist. It is so clear and great. Just completely love it.,1
Happy,1
this app is so buggy and the payment isnt even worth it,0
I love that you can multiple playlist it's really wonderful to be able to play the music that you like and the different playlist and even ones with albums to play whenever you want them to or to play continuously it's there are no ads eit I've never loved music more I can pick all the ones that I want and put them in one John and I can pick all the other ones that I really like and put them in another one and then I have at least two that I can listen to but I have five right now and it's great,1
"Regardless if you use free edition or buy premium, you will ALWAYS get ads. Will upgrade score when Spotify fixes this but I don't see it happening as Ive used Spotify premium for years",0
I can't play a single song I try to play a song it play another random song,0
The most effective and fastest app for music and affordable subscription,1
"Beautiful application for music, used several before but for past quite a time nothing best came to me as Spotify.",0
They have a great selection of songs and they always have the latest ðŸŽµ ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ ðŸŽ¶,1
"Used to love Spotify until the last several months. Podcasts will pause themselves at random intervals without warning, the app crashes at least once a week and almost all the time now, when I play a podcast, I have no way to pause/stop it unless I close the app altogether. I have restarted the app, my phone and even uninstalled/reinstalled it and it continues to happen every single day. I'm starting to think of cancelling my subscription",0
Good app but it doesn't allow users to search the song by saying it or by buzzing (or by other means also) it.,0
"Once updated, Spotify is the greatest music app I've ever used! I love the intuitive playlists crafted for you based off your listening to just a few vsongs - very unique!",1
"Spotify has given me the opportunity to listen to my fav podcast, MORBID!! I love it!!!!!!",1
Such a great app! Hoping it would also show MVs in the future,1
Enjoying the extent music selection even with commercials. Thank you kindly,1
Love all the music from decades ago.,1
"The shuffle function is rubbish and always loops the same songs for certain chunks of time. And there is the occasional glitch. But aside from that, the best music service in the world.",1
Brings back many memories with the songs I chose.,1
Please turn off shuffle play!!!,0
"It's nice because even if I don't have the paid for service I can still have music without it open on my screen unlike YouTube which not only wants me to keep my screen on but frequently pesters me if I'm still watching it. Which is very inconvenient for use while doing anything else at the same time, especially if I'm trying to wash dishes...",0
Love everything this has to offer. U can listen to music with another person at the same time and change each other's music. Has lyrics for 95% songs so u can do keroke. U can hit replay. Make ur own playlists.,1
"I deleted than re downloaded the app and it got stuck on the loading screen, I've tried restarting my phone, deleting and re installing the app, and the website works fine but I really wanna listen to music, pls fix",0
"I would rate this at 5 stars IF there was access to some older, more traditional music; particularly in the Christian hymns, Christmas music and country from the 70's-90's.",1
"I don't like they took away the preview feature for when you select add songs. I used to be able to find new music easily, but now I have to add the song to my playlist to decide if I want it. If I don't like it then I have to go back and delete it.",0
"I like how it plays in the background and all, and also its vast collection of songs but I can't play the song by itself, it shuffles around. And one time when I searched a song, it didn't came out, only playlists did. Hope you can fix this. Cause I can't listen to the song I originally want to hear. Also, there are too many ads.",0
Wrost! Lots of ads.... Irritating to listen any song...,0
If the Google Play is there I must do the premium overall it is the best music app,1
Please if you would provide us with a video player It would be fantastic,1
"Love it, The only problem is now we can collaborate with other people without getting premium and now whenever you want to hear a preview for songs before you add them it won't let you. Honestly it's kinda sad because I've had Spotify for awhile and they changed a lot of stuff to premium :/",0
"Intuitive app, without many ads and the original podcasts are very good",1
"I am not able to login to my account from my phone. I tried it more than 20 times. And now when i open it, it is showing only the logo.",0
Honestly I don't see anything wrong with this app. I've never had any issues with Spotify or anything like that.,1
Doesn't display what song I'm playing on my phone anymore..,0
This is amazing they have a free trial i love this app,1
It's a very easy app to use easier than any other app I've used. The ads can be annoying but at least the subscription isn't an insane amount like some these days.,0
Always great and latest music,1
Why does my device keep switching??? Almost seems like I have lost control of my Playlist! Songs change on its own after every 10 to 15 seconds:((,0
"Hey Spotify, will you stop feeding me random garbage podcasts. They are not in any way relevant. Or at least give the user the ability to hide them, or stop all recommendations. Also your support page takes directly to the community page instead of offering actual help from you, so up yours for that.",0
Very great keep up the great work love it,1
This is the best app to listen offline music,1
Spotify is the best! I've never come across anything like it. I've downloaded many of these music apps but I always end up deleting them cos they don't exactly suit my taste and at some point I concluded I'm probably not a music person but not this time. Spotify it is!!! Where have you been all my life!,0
"After update on 14 June,app is behaving abnormally. Not playing any song. No volume. My account name showing weird. Please fix it soon. My life is boring without Spotify.",0
No landscape view in current song page ðŸ˜© still 5 stars but i like landscape,1
No longer using this service due to company allowing garbage podcasts with mountains of misinformation.,0
"Overall it's a great service, I tend to use it on my phone at work or the Playstation at home. I use premium so no ads, my biggest issue is the songs keep getting removed when I go back to listen to them. Granted I'm looking for songs that they had a few years ago but it's disappointing I'm unable to find or play them.",0
Good experiences . And good collection,1
Good without premium,1
It's a very good audio platform I have ever seen. I can also create my own playlist in it.,1
Not much ads and good podcasts are there.,0
It's a very nice app with all kinds of songs,1
I have no words it's the best app every but sometimes it's will opt work but is super app,1
Annoying that your music will sometimes just undownload if you have premium,0
Shame on Spotify for not choosing to retain Neil Young. I am done with Spotify.,0
Only option it gives to listen to albums is on shuffle and at that it doesn't play some of the songs in the album it play songs from other albums I don't want to listen to every song on shuffle I want to listen to the album from start to finish from songs in order and when you're listening to an album it doesn't show you all the songs and I may just give you the option to listen to them on shuffle,0
I could not live without Spotify and their new feature that shows lyrics has me like fatal atracction ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,0
"Spotify plays whatever they want to play not what you select. I like the ability to create playlists, but the selection process is a problem.",0
"more popups than a 1990s porn site, runs in background like malware even though i tell it not to, deletes songs randomly, probably going to cancel the service",0
"its useful even with the free version, its a good backup listening tool, kinda no reason to not download it to keep it as once again a backup",0
Excellent,1
"Songs skip now, have to constantly close the app and reopen to make it play correctly.",0
"A little pricey, but am enjoying it....",1
Best music app after purchasing premium ðŸ™ðŸ»,1
Love Spotify! All my favorite artists in one place!! Perfect!! House parties have been rocking with Spotify!! ðŸ¤˜,1
I love this app. Every song I can find here. Amazing,1
Doesn't work properly. won't go onto car mode ðŸ¤”,0
Worked great till newest update. Lost the ability to connect to my pioneer radio.,0
In the last couple weeks the podcasts will cut for addbreak but then it starts playing a different episode with no pre warning and when i go back its not even in the place it left off and shows i finished it when i know for a fact i haven't,0
"The worst way to do anything. The app struggles with the most basic things. The app often glitches to the point where you cannot use it. And these clowns spam your email asking you to join? You are all bad, your service is bad, you should all feel bad.",0
Great for listening and music discovery & promoting your own music.,1
Just the delay in the beginning but other than that it's a good app all around.,1
Great love it but the paid version is way better,1
It's a good app it really is except I can't see my songs anymore and it won't let me listen to it without shuffle. I have my songs in a specific order and it won't let me listen to it. I loved Spotify but this is mad annoying.,1
I would rate this 5 stars if it actually played the song I picked because when I search up the song tap on it and then play it it plays an entire different song and I never get to listen to the song I can add it to my favorites and try to play it there but it still plays an entire different song and I could get a better app than this free and no ads,0
Awesome one word is all I'm going to use to describe this app,1
I can't close the app. Always running,0
I use it almost every day on my other computer I use for gaming as well as on here and it has been great for me I have listened to way more genres now.,1
Mast app hai us karke dhekho,1
Fabulous,1
How do I cancel the premium feature on this app I mean I had subscribed by mistake and now I cant cancel the subscription please if there is anyone out there who wishes to subscribe for the premium feature don't do it because you'll just waste your time and money this app is trash,0
Love Spotify. Just wish it actually worked without crashing all of the time.,1
"Great music experience, only gripe when I Shazam music and open through Spotify it doesn't recognize the track until I manually type.",0
It continues to operate great while I'm riding my bike around the neighborhood!,1
Watch app is not working properly I hit the play button and it sends me to bluetooth but if I skip the song it will play and is able to play on watch with quick control buttons,0
"The app works well and I don't mind the ads. But I think that it should have an option to play in shuffle or play in the order the songs are in; I make my playlists in the order I like them, so shuffle being the only option makes it frustrating.",0
It's the Best app and with the lyrics!,1
Very smooth and usefull app and the best part is that it plays songs in background for free,1
"Spotify was my favourite app to play songs and for some entertainment purposes,but now this app is such a waste and greedy of money and destroyed many people's enjoyment including mine too. I highly recommend not to download. Only people with premium can enjoy musics without add interference. Such greedy and waste of time.",0
It's so annoying when I want to play music on my playlist it randomly adds the most shittiest song and can't get any of the ones I like,0
Since when does Spotify Mobile have forced shuffle and plays like a radio? (Not audio quality but mechanics),0
"I've never had a problem with Spotify and their selection of music is vast, including podcast. Highly recommend!",1
"Spotify is really good app But please management can you give me a little favour by removing Olivia Rodrigo's photo from ""Made for you"" I love that Album and automatically made albuns in it as well, but her photo makes ut annoying. There are many more better artiss than her I guess. Why spotify should gear my request? Because applications are made ""people friendly"" . Artists only share their songs. Please accept my requestðŸ’¤",0
"Worst music app. I tried to signup using both my Google account and phone number. But it buffers for minutes after the signup and eventually 'something went wrong' pops up everytime. Restarted app many times and my phone thinking it could be a problem with the device, but it is still not opening beyond the signup/login page.",0
Got to go after listening to music when you're outside or your music app to help you with math homework or anything or just to listen to music or the calm down stations where you can sleep or anything I've recommend using this app Spotify thank you.,1
Fantastic !! No complaints what so ever. Keep it up you guys !!,1
Nice App. A bit annoying without a subscription,0
It is still great but over time it became more confusing with a lot of new stuff. Also app speed has decreased.,0
Playes atleast 15 suggested songs in a row and none of them are even close to the type of music you like plus you get an add after every like 3 songs and there can even be four at a time,0
So far so good no issues which is great and good music.,1
Nice,1
Last two updates have ruined the app. Turns off mod song and shuffle is stuck on. So frustrating.,0
Very bad because download song can't play after one week..,0
Not bad I like this App,1
"I only really use this app for podcasts. I still don't understand why it will stop my current episode and then go to a random one. It's very annoying, happens daily.",0
other competitors? never heard of em only know Spotify,0
"Been using it since high school. Way better than Apple music. More raw, more artists, more music.",1
Its glitching even for the premium members Hate it,1
The app is always messing up. I hate paying for this when all it does is not work,0
Only but a big reason for 3 stars. I've been using for nearly 2 years and I loved it but for the past few days I've been having trouble with 'searching' songs and I thought to reinstall thinking it might work but the worst part is I can't even sign in or log in now... I miss it... It would be so kind if I can get it back. Thank you,0
"Not sure what's happened with this app. But it skips my songs all the time, just like a CD. I uninstalled/reinstalled and even in between got a new phone. Absolutely NO DIFFERENCE. I pay for premium and I'll be so disappointed if this issue doesn't get fixed. It used to be my favorite for music...unfortunately no longer. Very frustrated.",0
Best music app I have ever used,1
Tons of glitches the last few months really annoying to use esp while driving,0
"Great app for music. Honestly just rated so the app wouldn't ask me again, but all honesty it really is an awesome app for music. There's not much it doesn't have. I mean, even if your into strange, ""not so common"" genres, Spotify usually tends to have them as well.",1
I love the quality sound I get in my car. I use my Spotify more the then pandora. Great selections,1
After using this app for many years this last update has caused an issue. I love listening to music while walking to work and even sleeping. When ever i turn my phone screen off Spotify will glitch and pause the song in the middle of it and then unpuase and its certainly annoying when im trying to relax. I might cancel my subscription and go to a different music appðŸ˜• as much as i dont want to this is just getting so frustrating,0
"The best music app, you get what you like without delay. I recommend it for music lovers",1
Best ever,1
The app is constantly closing. It is glitching when you pause something its not showing the most recently paused item on my homescreen which means i have to go into Spotify and reselect it. It has been doing this for a while now. Along with the new releases never showing me anyone i actually listen too this app is becoming a waste of money,0
I love Spotify! It's so nice being able to listen to lovely classical music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ’—ðŸ’œâ™¾ï¸,1
Been a subscriber for over 10 years and there is no other app like it.... Please don't change anything Kanye.,0
Good music app. Missing some songs I love. Charged me wrong once.,0
"I like this app because of the wide variety of music, but a flaw to this app is the amount of ads during and after the music or podcast you listened to, and the 5 skips per hour. Other than that this is a good app.",0
"Very good. Great sound . I do miss YouTube music's video, but I left them because of their strangling of free speech , in relation to the covid debacle. I really appreciated spotify standing it's ground and not taking down Robert Malone podcast with Seth Rogan.",0
The problem is you have to download a whole album if you want to listen to one song or go and create a new Playlist but other than that it's a wonderful app for music streaming.,1
"For the little effect it will have, Im putting a one star rating as long as spotify keeps censoring content. If it keeps up after this drama with spotify and content cools off...itll be time to pull out the ol' mp3 player.",0
Why can't I have different playlist at the same time?,0
"Annoying. I didn't want to have to download and use spotify to begin with just to listen to a particular podcast, but once I set out to do so I encountered numerous obnoxious hindrances just to begin listening to what I wanted. Login issues? Have to download the full podcast just to begin listening - no streaming while downloading? If you're going to pay for exclusivity spotify, the app experience better be flawless because you were already annoying me from the outset.",0
Been missing my 6 playlists on my home page for almost a full year now with no fix....,0
"It's good for being FREE. Ads are 30 mins apart, but long as train smoke; but....it's free! I'm happy with it versus paying FYouTube, just so I could turn my damÃ±ed screen off. They make enough money off ad clickers.",1
"Poor performance app does the hell what it likes, constantly reinstalling the frigging thing.put a question to Spotify never get a answer back, just keep taking the money guys but,spend some on development aye.",0
Shuffle function isn't very shuffle. I have about 500 songs I added to one playlist and I hear only about 20 of them repeated randomly every week on my drives to/from work.,0
"It is awesome, i have the free version. I don't mind the adds, I just don't like the fact that they are so loud. I find the right volume I want, and then bam an add, it is really frustrating.",0
"The app doesn't let me log in and just tells me that I'm set to offline, I tried all of the tricks but it doesn't work, please fix this ASAP!",0
Good,1
"truly going down the hill.. have to close the app to start a song, crashes randomly and many more bugs.. really annoying when ur even paying for it",0
Function is good for now,1
I love using Spotify... It's easier to listen to songs and genres I prefer.,1
The app keeps glitching... But the content is great!,1
"Yeh the update is trash. Why would i listen to random songs if i was picking a song in my playlist? I pick a specific song in my playlist, pressed play, and a random song started playing. Which is a ""suggested"" Song. Bro just let me play my music. Just add the ""suggested song"" somewhere else than making someone angry. Just nah.",0
Every song is good and the ads are ok,1
As of latley its started to buffer ever time I've locked my phone to do something and listen to music. But its every time I'm on a locked screen or as soon as I turn my screen off that it stops my music. Never used to do this .,0
My relationship swings in roundabouts with this app. Love the concept but boi o boi does the app consistently fail on me. It also takes a fair time to load as well and I dont have many downloaded playlists. The current issue is spotify doesnt show the bottom sticky nav bar of the current song playing. This means i have to close the app and reopen...no biggie i know. However this is multiple times a day everyday ...,0
Love the music ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ easy to navigate..,1
Please contact me and tell me WHY the shuffle play option has disappeared from your app?!?!? I need to shuffle songs on my playlists thanks!!! Yours desperately....,0
Great app recommend it..commercials are short And enjoy not overwhelming,1
I'm fine with ads just don't make them pause the music. I like to have music playing while I'm doing stuff. Its super annoying having to stop what I'm doing to walk over to my phone to press play to listen to an ad.,0
Honestly a really great app especially since you can import your song files you can basically listen to all the songs you want at a reasonable price too,1
Everyone else can see song text but i can not and i pay for the family account and have one of the nieuws phones some of my friends even the same and it makes me sad,0
"There isn't a song that I can't find here, big or small artists.",0
"App takes 5 min for it to load so I can start to use it and when It does, it crashes.",0
"After EVERY song and ever CLICK there's two or three ads playing you cannot skip. If you make a playlist it adds random songs you can't remove. If you click a song everything plays BUT the song. You only get 6 skips per day, or 1 or no additional every hour. There's a bug or glitch that replays a small part at the very beginning of a song, you have to reopen the app or it won't stop. Don't download. Sometimes the music just stops playing and I have to reinstall it. Fix it.",0
Why can't I download a specific song without the need to download a whole playlist And I want to be able to shuffle all my songs not that I have to keep moving from playlist to playlist U guys really need to update alot of features on ur app And if am playing a song online and I want to start it from beginning or go to the previous song it becomes unresponsive,0
Nice music  pls make more music like Spotify,1
The new update is really terrible. It lags at the slightest opening of the app.,0
Play random song that I don't want like even look for the right song no random song so one star,0
"Spotify has been nothing short of incredible for me. Easy to use, all my music is available. Perfect",1
"Really good app. Just a suggestion, if you could give the lyrics for Hindi songs in Devanagari instead of romanisation that'd be amazing! I know you're coming out with english lyric translations, so kindly go back to using devanagari for hindi lyrics in the songs.",1
I did not get premium just for it to be glitchier. If you open something else and then go back to change the music you have to close out of spotify completely or else it will not function correctly,0
Stop recommending toxic content that has no connection to my usage. Allow users who've been using the service for years now for music to block podcasts as whole. Stop peddling your agenda.,0
It's a very good app. Before I used Spotify I was using YouTube music and it wasn't any better than this. The only Don fall is that I didn't find all the songs that I listened to on YouTube music here but that's the least of my problems.,0
"First 2 years was best with this lovely app but... Now it's automatically getting crashed after I play a song. I mean I can't listen to songs anymore, it's automatically getting closed (after playing a song ) please help me!",0
"Crashes all the time. Doesn't want to work while connected through Android Auto. When it is working, it won't pause when hit pause. The more I use this app the worst it gets. Getting really frustrated with this app!",0
"Same issue as others, needs to be fixed since the last update",0
Great music it has any music ever created,1
It's colouring my world. Especially with your throwbacks and regae,1
Spotify is great it has all the music i want to listen to,1
superr,1
Lots to listen to. I use on long car journeys or while doing dishes or housework or outside pitting clothes out on the line or in the supermarket...Mr Ballan and The African Diaries are my go too but I listen to music and get spiritual inspiration and encourage there also. Pet peeve is that if I pick a music genre the app only plays the first 1 or 2 from my chosen artist or type of music. So I have to keep checking the phone and charging it back to my choice. That's pretty annoying& frustrating.,0
"In need of improvement, there is way too much content to that is promoted, I can not sort by genres, worse still I can not define the genres I listen to and not show those I don't, even in the paid for version!! Can it play music? Yes, is it worth the money? Absolutely not! When you can not customise your own listening experience to suite your own taste in music then you are kind off missing the point.",0
When I updated the app it wont let me pick the songs that I want to listen to and I only get 6 skips an hour. So I uninstalled it and redownloaded it and the same thing happend,0
It's not working properly like it's just hanging up... And get stuck in between the song... It's not like my phone is hanging...just having some troubles with Spotify only...,0
Won't show current song playing leaving one to scour the web based on lyrics! So much fun,0
The best music streaming app currently available.,1
Pretty good music app i have many favorite songs i just hate that when i want to hear my favorite music it changes to other music i don't want to hear and that are not even in my liked section or stuff like that,0
I use this more than SXM. Very much enjoy this app as I have the family plan which is cheaper than most subscriptions.,1
"Now playing bar disappears often, Bluetooth connectivity with my vehicle doesn't relay or update current song/podcast playing. Had no issues whatsoever with previous phone(LG G6)",0
Absolutely Stunning! More like they know my soul and give me what i want. ðŸ–¤,1
"Honestly, it was great for a long while. But once the monthly thing ended, it was torture, especially the 6 skips per hour. In conclusion I'll say it was good...until time ran out",0
"I like it, I got this app just for the Joe Rogan podcast because one of my favorite personalities interviewed with him and now I listen to all of them on here",1
"I listen to a selection of my music. Fast responses. Sportify is such an icebreaker, mooder changer and vibe twister. Me likey",1
"Waaaaay to many advertisements now, time for youtube! Used to be a great app, however the amount of adds is waaaaay to much.",1
Good app. I love to hear music from this app. But I dont like sometimes ad and telling that change spotify to spotify premium,1
"Wonderful app, with a Wonderful music experience",1
I've had Spotify for 3 years now and I love it. Awhile back I had some issues with the web player version of it but after a time of little to no use from the app it fixed itself and now works wonderfully and gives me everything I need at the click of a button.,1
"This app is the worst I mean I still haven't opened it yet and when I try to sign in it says Internet connection is not working âš’ but its actually working OK sooooooooo,fix that! I have seen many apps better than this.",0
Good,1
"Currently experiencing some problem, I've updated my playlists daily and had it downloaded for offline jamming but currently can't any of the playlists in my library except for those songs that I've liked (downloaded) you need to be connected to a wifi or you're using data to play/shuffle a playlist..",0
Very nice app,1
Been with yall for 8 years still the best music streaming app out here,1
Well..... I recently gave spotify a 5 star rating..... Till recently when i realized that my downloaded songs are deleting themselves immediately i change to offline mode.... This is very irritating as i have to stay on an internet connection daily so that i dont lose my songs.... Please check on that,0
It's pretty good but to many ads,1
"Constant bugs (no play bar, ect.) Literally every time I swap apps. Also like button is too easy to accidentally unlike something",0
They have all the music and tunes I find missing on other apps. I know I haven't explored the app fully but for now I'm happy just setting Allister and listening.,1
"The app is incredibly buggy. It randomly stops playing music, when I resume it forgets where I left off and starts playing something from two days ago, the UI often stops working and I have to kill the app and restart to fix it.",0
Great app! Lots of great music whenever I want it!,1
I like how easy it is to navigate the buttons on the app,1
"Offers all the artists & podcasts that I want, but every update makes it worse. It's been a year and this is still true.",1
its very helpful to find good music,1
"Been using Spotify for over a decade (premium), and it's been borderline unusable for the past two months. I'm using it on a Galaxy S21, and the app freezes, skips, and lags so frequently that I've been using YouTube to listen to music. The craziest part is that Spotify has yet to release a patch despite many users on Reddit, Twitter, and the app store experiencing these problems. I've reached out to Spotify multiple times to no avail. If you don't already have premium, id suggest not wasting $",0
I thought it played your favorite music not every time I try and play a song it plays a whole different Playlist. Fix your app,0
"Music was aight, podcasters were terrible, and the add breaks don't even give you 30 minutes anymore. Been a longtine listiner and it's gone to the dogs. Dont download unless YouTube is too inconvenient.",0
It was ok for the first few weeks but after that it's showing I'm offline even when I have good WiFi connection....plz look into this issue cause it getting on my nerves now!!!,0
"Been using Spotify for a long time now, just shy of about two years and recently (yesterday) i was making a new playlist in class when i realized i can no longer preview music before i add it to my playlist so i could only add songs i knew as i didn't know what other songs Spotify had to offer, please fix as soon as possible. :(",0
"Two stars because of the ""shuffle"" function. If I start a playlist on a certain song, i can pretty much predict what's coming next, and it's ALWAYS the same narrow band of songs, and it NEVER plays all of the songs in a playlist, especially if it's a large playlist. I work 9 hour shifts, and within an hour, I'll hear the song i started with, on a 4 hours playlist. Rubbish",0
Overall good experience. I've used Spotify for a little over 3 years now. I have no major complaints.,1
Great way to get your music and find new stuff!,1
"Quite useful and entertaining, however, there are some downsights for instance; not being able to listening to unpopular musics or the special covers of the musics are limited most of the time. What I mean is the song variety is not the way that I want it to be. Other than that, the best music app which provides the suprerior sound quality among the others.",0
Absolute money grabbing company. Impossible to stop your direct debit and cancel this dreadful service. I can't tell you how much I regret getting involved with these charlatans.,0
Liked it a lot . It is easy to use the app and also can be played with slow internet access. Only problem is ads but overall that's the best app among all the music playing apps. Thanks Spotify Team for it.,1
Love it,1
I'm on 3 months of free premium so I can't complain. And my sound taste senses have been broadened.,1
"Great music available, but it frequently doesn't pull up the ""now playing"" overlay on the app. Meaning I can't view, pause, or stop music that's playing. I have to close the app and re-open it... Incredibly frustrating.",0
"I bought premium and my downloaded videos won't play,",0
I am very happy with this app. Playlist are very easy to build edit and use. You have music I am surprised to find and can't find on other sites,1
I am using this app since last 4years i am feeling good that i am user of this app. This app is soo good as music as well as podcasts and episodes.,1
The app used to be good for music (it has never been the best option for podcasts) but it is so buggy now that it is almost unusable.,0
"This app is good after all but sometimes it doesn't play the song that I wanted to listen to, and also I hate the skip song limit (6 skips per hour) and I want it to be removed because it's annoying and frustrating. I'll rate 5 stars if you fix those issues.",0
Too goodU can still hear the music when u go to different apps,1
"I TOLD YOU TO SAY WHAT'S IN THE UPDATES, EVEN IF IT'S JUST BUG FIXES! AND ME REQUIRE LYCANTHROPY BY CARDI!!!!",0
I love listening to music and Spotify make it even greater ðŸ˜Œ ðŸ™Œ,1
It's really good and I bet their going to fix the bugs that are their but 5 stars,1
I am okay with ads but the problem is that We have limited amount of skips and we cn choose the song we want to hear,0
"I would have given 5 stars, but, it seems canvases don't seem to work for some of us.",0
Can't even listen to a song! Everytime I click on a song it plays everything but the song I want. I will not be using Spotify for any longer.,0
"The only thing i want is lossless audio or call it (Low, Normal, High, Very high, PLEASE ADD THIS ""Ultra high"") pls pls pls",0
"Pretty good overall. For some reason the app keeps opening up in the background and I have to force stop it to get it to go away. Podcasts are kind of messy to find too. Other than that, pretty solid, been using this app for years.",0
"Good library, very poorly programmed. The app's behavior is extremely unwieldy on Android.",0
So many problems. First is when I try to search for a song and try to play it. It starts to play a different song and artist. Second one is when I go to my play list I cannot choose what song I wanted to play I cannot rewind or go back and then it only plays for 30 secs. Third is I cannot close the song properly theres no options.,0
It's free and great. But or limited on skips. I have switch to YouTube I have to listen to commercials just like Spotify but unlimited skips that's the big difference and why I listen to YouTube more than I do Spotify,0
"Im very happy with my service, love all the different options and artist and song suggestions.",1
"Amazing variety, love the recommendations and ease of use",1
Great variety great music!!!,1
"Much love. This app is my favorite when it comes to making playlists, being able to crossfade and adjust equalizer. Well worth it. ðŸ‘Œ",1
Adds overload,1
Spotify premium the best app for me. Music to podcast always find something new.,1
"I've been enjoying so far, However, if i wanna buy premium, (cuz I haven't subscribed yet) it won't let me, it always says ""Oops, please try again or contact our team"" i tried over and over again and it didn't work, so please fix it, i just wanna have premium, (and u can have my money , if u want it) pls fix it, that's all",0
"2022 edit- plays without prompt, and when my head phones disconnect they just continue playing through speaker which is very annoying. Stop playing mid episodes of podcast and if I touch my phone it plays again. Very very buggy lately. I hope this is fixed soon or I don't want to be paying for a malfunction app that plays music when I don't want it to...",0
Super,1
"I can listen to all my music however, i have manually scrolling all the way down and i hatethat the heart button is right next to the different player button. Edit: scroll botton is back! But now the app is glitchy",0
Good,1
Now ad's in the podcasts WTAF so why do we pay a premium for NO AD'S gets more convoluted with every update. More bugs and volume issues constantly turning it down. Widget now missing again. Time to go elsewhere,0
"Its good for the most and i use this app every day but keeps on playing over other apps when spotify 'was not suppost to be open' and it comes randomly and then skips songs at random. It also deleted a few of my favourite songs from a show i liked and i dont have premium so i dont get to listen to them ever again... with all of this though i still really like the app because of how easy it is to use and i love the karaoke feature,,, ads r a bit over the top tho",1
Not able to play a song ...song starts n app get foreclose,0
Nine out of ten days it works fine. One out of ten days the app crashes constantly. Everyday the app struggles when entering orvleaving wifi coverage. Honestly once I find a better option I'm out.,0
My rating of 5 stars is mostly due to the way you let Joe Rogan do his podcast with the freedom to do it his way and The Last podcast on the left is one of my favorites Keep up the good work ,1
This app isn't bad at all its just when you want to play a song or something it shuffles it and you have to use all of your skips in order to play the specific song,0
Duniya fkdkhy h acha h acha,1
It is a very good app for listening to music and your favourite songs especially if you buy the premium listening,1
"Normally great, experiencing a lot of crashes lately however",0
Full entertainment.. Thanks Spotify.. Good.. Really good.. Very good... The collection is very very good.. I really love it...,1
Something is wrong with my playlist i try to play the song and it just starts from random place and it is like a small trailer.,0
"Didn't understand where to write the feedback, so writing here. When pressing ""add song"" to the playlist, suggested songs display the same thing in the name of the song and the singer. for example, ""Yellow submarine Yellow submarine"" instead of ""Yellow submarine Beatles"". Also, inconvenient structure of the queue. It is impossible to see the list of what you listened few songs before. It is impossible to easily rearrange and move again what you listened after few songs. Please see YouTube Music",0
Loving it much more sonce I went premium love being able to search for what I want to hear and the daily play lists seem to be getting better with time,1
"Was going to continue listening to my favorite podcast on my mi box, but every time I tried to play the episode I wanted to listen to (nr 80-something) it jumped to the first ever episode and no way to skip ahead or anything. VERY frustrating!!!",1
Need to fix bugs it keeps displaying layoit without the song being played currently. Im unable to set sleep timer etc because of this even after closing and reopening the app sometimes. Cant reinstall Ill lose all my downloads(1000+). This needs to be fixed:/,0
I have many issues with Group Session Features... Spotify must want to fix it as soon as possible..,0
Allows misinformation to be spread. Avoid using it and avoid your kids using it. There are better alternatives out there.,0
"It's just that the people who haven't taken a subscription have to go through too many ads.... but beyond that If you see, the app is perfect in the rest of the ways ... â£ï¸loved it ðŸ™ƒ",1
"Even after a new update, spotify never works properly. Now the issue is its not playing podcast videos. Really tired of paying for an app that never works. Cleared my cash, force stopped the app, checked settings allow all data and not save pods as audio only",0
So frustrated lately. I love spotify. I pay for spotify. The past number of weeks the app has been wretched and just getting worse. I'm attempting a reinstall for the second time this month. I had over a dozen podcasts waiting to download... for almost a week... I live in decent wifi service. I can't put podcasts in Queue and have them actually play as told. It'll only play in offline mode for a few hours before it demands I reconnect it. I want to love the app as much as I did before,0
"great selection of songs, easy to use, reasonable price, great interactions with users - I don't even use it as much as I should and I love it!",1
It adds other songs into my list and it has to shuffle the songs in playlist while i cant choose which certain songs i want to play,0
It has all my favorite songs on it to old to new songs they even have 80s songs,0
I have been using Spotify for many years. It is an amazing music player I have ever seen.,1
Good,1
"I love Spotify. Even though when my premium ran out, I could no longer access my library of songs.",1
"I don't know what's happening but every song I play lags, the songs sound like a scratched CD but the podcasts play without any pauses or problems, I deleted and re-downloaded hoping that it would be fixed but it's still an issue. I tried updating but nothing helped.",0
A good app to stream music from,1
It's doesn't update fast enough and there re songs I can't find here. I like the app but it's limited to a lot of things. That's y I prefer YouTube music,0
"Its really good, solid experience Its just that, for some reason i cant watch podcasts on the app, like i can watch the video on the PC but not on the app, is because of my phone model? Samsung A71",1
Great new music weekly. And if you download the music you can listen still offline,1
Just had to sit through 6 adds straight as a free user only to it to play a completely different song than the one I clicked on.,0
Great especially for the sleep timer,1
"Absolutely horrible, cant even choose a song to play. Works worse than ever before and honestly literally anything else is better, even audio jungle and you hear it screaming at you half the time but it's still better than back to back ads and to fix all of the horribly stupid problems that are only on mobile mind you, you have to buy premium. Genuinely scummy and has likely resulted to lots of people abandoning a once semi-decent app. Absolutely deplorable and saddening.",0
"Used Spotify for years upon years without the need of any membership. The ads are short, don't come up too often and sometimes have good songs in them so they're not an issue. I'm able to make my own playlists, save as many songs as I like to my liked list and can skip / change songs any time I want until the next ad pops up which is completely reasonable. Used Spotify on PC, Ps4 and Mobile, which all link togther, for the best experience and to get the most out of what it has to offer.",1
App is not connected with internet while mobile net is ON,0
"Random marketing notifications. I don't need every app on my phone sending me notifications at all hours begging for attention. Yes, I know the Daily Mix feature exists, why did you feel the need to beep me about it? It's not new, or pressing, it's been there for years.",0
thank you a lot...for the music,1
Best music player app.. Thanks Spotify! Good job ðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œ,1
The constant bugs are annoying for a service I pay for. My songs will skip in their own all the time and it's very frustrating.,0
"Great music app that I use on the daily. One thing I don't like though is I sometimes save the clean version of a song instead of the explicit version on accident. There should be a way to filter your preferences so that all songs available are either only explicit or only clean or both, depending on how you set it. Also just more content such as music/audio from the web like YouTube.",0
"Awesome App. I love that they support Joe Rogan and free speech. I love the discovery portion where they suggest music I will like. I've had Spotify since they started. Only thing is there are ads even if you pay for Spotify, but only during podcasts. They used to mess up your playback, but they fixed that for the most part.",1
"Spotify used to be good, but now it has so many issues (app, desktop, etc.) it is not worth any amount of money.",0
This app is terrible without a member ship! Cant play a certain song? Look it up! NOW IT WONT EVEN LET ME DO THAT! I press play on the song and something random starts playing! Spotify is terrible!,0
Sound quality is really nice i loved it,1
this app is a big L when im tryna to play music it plays random shi,0
"Randomly stopping while playing and when I restart app or song, there are no controls on screen.",0
I cant even listen to 1 song it makes me shuffle random songs,0
"Shotty podcasts with untruthful and even dangerous content. Pandora, I'm coming back!",0
Best music player app!! I have been using Spotify since it first came out and havent had any issues streaming or playing music.,0
This is a good music app other than other apps TQ for founding founding this app,1
It's totally brutal. I can't even click on the songs I want to listen. And if I play my playlists into shuffle it's making me listen to a song I didn't even add on the playlist. But other than that it's a good music app.,1
"Why I can't play the music I want ? I always click on a music and it play another what is really annoying, I request Spotify to recover that problem soon , it makes mess , I am not being able to listen to many musics for this problem",0
Love the choice of music always on,1
Excellent application !! Superb playlists.,1
"Been crashing a lot lately and a lot of artists have been removing their music from it. I've been with Spotify for a reaaaallly long time, but I'm starting to look elsewhere.",0
It's super good you can find lots of music,1
"I loved Spotify until the most recent update. Now it's just becoming pay to listen. You can't skip through more then about 5 songs without premium and you can't choose a specific song to listen too. I'm super pissed at this update and I'm sure others are to, please fix this it's really angering me.",0
Love Spotify. Was a firm Pandora listener for a long time but the app started crashing so much I couldn't listen to music. Begrudgingly switched to Spotify... I will never go back. ðŸ˜…,0
Good app minor bug. On Pixel 6 I have minor visual bugs on the search tab.,0
I Love this app and there has so many songs my favourite song is there but to one problem is there there has so many ad that's why I am giving only 4 star,0
Good but it's annoying that you need to listen to entire songs so you can cache them when you are offline. Great app though ðŸ‘,0
Go back to the original update where it shows 5 songs of the artist ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
"Its a very awsome app and i have got all of my childhoodcollection on your app,i felt so good refreshing my childhood memories,however the drawback is the subscription part.",1
"having a lot of trouble with the app right now. the playlists don't play correctly, when i tap on a song it just simply plays a 5-10 secod clip out of it. when i finally managed to play one of the songs i couldn't do anything with it rather than turn it off, i can't skip to another song, i can't play it back. idk what's happening but it'll stay on 2 stars until you fix it. edit: oh, i guess it's how free version works! good job guys, you've lost all your potential! terrible app, uninstalled.",0
"Why I can't listen to music on spotify. If I want to listen to music, it will automatically exit from the app. I already subscribe the premium one. It happen from last 2 days.",0
Why can't I listen to my playlist?,0
"I miss old Spotify, were u can listen to your song first, before you put it on your playlist, I don't like the update â˜¹ï¸",0
"Hello, can you please make a feature where you can delete your recently played, the ""Good morning"" recommendation, and block episodes? i accidentally tapped something that isn't for me. and im uncomfortable with it.",0
"i wish there were a place to see ALL your playlists, not only the public ones, not only a part of them in your feed, all of them",0
"The app allows you to listen to music for free but there's also a cheap monthly subscription which only costs five euros here in Serbia. There's also family plans and duo plans which are for two people. Premium mode allows you to download songs for offline listening and it's great when you don't have access to internet. The free mode has its limitations, though, and you can only listen in shuffle mode. Songs also have lyrics which are synced in real-time so you can sing your favourite tunes.",1
"It's great when it works, but sometimes you're just paying for an app to give you the bird...",1
"I love spotify, but now there seems to be a glitch. I first thought it was my phone so I ended up getting a new one. I assumed it was, since i had my phone for more than 4 years. I got my new phone and was ready to log in and enjoy my music, but then something went wrong. I log in and it automatiically logs me out. This is rear. I reached out to a specialist and said it was my phone and there is nothing anyone can help me with. I cancled my card so I don't get charged for next month. I guess after this person said there is nothing they can do, were the words of ""Time For A New Chapter""",0
"Started as an almost 5/5 app. But then product managers started to ""improve"" the product and with each upgrade the product is less usable for me. It's more about what they want you to listen to instead of what you want to listen to. Offline songs get deleted on a regular basis so you have to re-download them again and again. Last time I learned that on an airplane...",0
Very good,1
Great music app is so easy to want you are looking for,1
I love this app and how I can search up any song I want.,1
I used to love this app but NOT ANYMORE! IT crashes atleast once per song and it shuffled all my Playlists so my songs are no longer in the order that I put them in! Also it doesn't show the song that's currently playing or the fast forward button. So I'll be CANCELING MY damn subscription and deleting Spotify. Why did yall change EVERYTHING?! Everything was A-Ok before but now yall got it way screwed up! I'm PISSED OFF beyond retarded! ðŸ˜¤,0
The best music app.,1
Too much crashing after last update,0
Excellent app....ðŸ‘ Easy to use..lots of options... enjoying the music so much...,1
Good Music For Entertainment ,1
Just best music app for relaxing,1
The User Experience and UI of the mobile app is awful. Lots of missing features and functions such as sorting playlists are just hidden behind menu's and menu's and it's a very bad experience when compared to the desktop version.,0
Missing play pause buttons,0
The app is very nca and easy to use,1
Trash app. Auto opens when connected to Bluetooth with no option to disable. A buggy mess,0
For an app of this calibre I'm very disappointed. Why would I wanna play a Music and I won't be able to. I'm very disgusted by this Horrible app. UNINSTALLEDðŸš¶ðŸš¶,0
I've found so much great music from Spotify. If you aren't using it you're wrong,1
New update messes up my syncing in my truck and vette snd headphones. Please fix.,0
Great app but really needs to bring back the lock screen widget.,0
Had a few setting up problems but great since I ironed them out,1
I can find most songs I love but sometimes can't find older songs but love it none the less.,1
This apps just so good I've been listening to Spotify for a long time everything's good but there's just one problem with ads its just so disturbing while your enjoying your song there comes the ad to ruin your enjoyment ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜’,0
Qhenni just got the app i got all free skips but a few qeeks later that changed and nowni have to pay for that and pnly 6 skips an hour really evan pandora has more skips than thay like really do better,0
Never installed this but its in history as having done so,1
When I'm opening the app and after playing the song it's creating a glitch and goes to previous screen. The app automatically exist without even doing anything. I would like to issue to be resolved as soon as possible,0
"Since the last update I can't start the app, 9â‚¬ per month for an app that doesn't work ...",0
Great sound selections and taste. I love spotyify,1
Full package when it comes to music,1
It is relly amazing song app there are all songs it hasn't disappointed me,1
Great app but recently it's connectivity to other functions is enough to make me ditch it.......... so annoying. Sort it out Spotify,0
Spotify has all the songs I love and it so easy to ues,1
Good that one chooses what to listen to.,1
"Its pretty good i guess but its so annoying to use, you cant choose a song you want to play, you cant even choose a song in your playlists, and you get a limited amount of skips?? Why would skips need to be limited???? Ads are fine though, not alot of them.",0
"Ads are fine, if anything they're a necessity. But not playing the songs in your play list and forcing you to listen to bands you don't like ain't cool. Also the app lags between multiple devices. Edit: Not being able to cancel your subscription in the app is ridiculous and honestly I thought companies were past that kind of predatory behaviour at this point, locking in consumers and putting up obstacles to stop them from unsubscring is no longer the norm and spotify needs to catch up.",0
"Spotify refuses to pay artists fairly. Switch to Tidal, they have better audio quality anyways.",0
Constantly closes or stops playing. Often freezes when ads come on for old podcasts. It is a poorly optimized app despite such crazy success. I pay for premium but I feel like this is a scam. I will switch to another app once a big competitor arises.,0
"This app never fails to be unable to play downloaded podcasts / music when I'm on a trip. I downloaded the podcasts, I can see that they are downloaded but in offline mode it still won't let me play them. I'm so over this unreliable app. I'll be moving to Google podcasts when I need stuff downloaded. Hey Spotify, here is a tip. If you are going to pay Joe Rogan $100 million dollars, maybe you should invest in actually making you podcasting feature work as advertised",0
It never connects when wi fi is on. Rest all apps working fine. Disgusting,0
me encanta spotify y debera poner unos 2 meses gratis3 sigan asiii,1
Starts playing randomly now and opening the app doesn't even give me an option to play or pause the music anymore.,0
NICE,1
Great app. Wish I could add multiple tracks from a playlist at the same time to another playlist. It's very annoying having to do this on a pc and not on my phone.,0
app always crash,0
It's a good app but the shuffle mode suck I have 100s of songs but it plays the same ones over and over and sometimes my songs just disappear.,0
Pardro,1
Love my Spotify. Won't use a different service unless I want a video. Thanks for helping me through my day!,0
Amazing app for enjoying music and discovering new songs. ðŸ‘Œ,1
Being part of Spotify family is one of the most beautiful things that happened to me '21,1
"The last couple of months it has been very glitchy. Every single time I open the app, it says it has updated exactly 49 songs and the app will then stop and cannot download this mysterious last, 50th song. I have to restart my phone. Absolutely painful. Also music playing but no currently playing displaying on the screen, have to go into the app each time. Randomly shuts itself down too. The share function hasn't been working either. Unacceptable for premium subscription. Sort yourselves out",0
No uhd let alone hd tracks This was promised by the end of 2021 what happened. Cancelled subscription,0
I cant play my music offline even after ive saved them to listen offline please address this quickly cause i like my music,1
"Customer service for such a large company should not be down. Also, the fact that you're unable to report disinformation taking place on podcast, is unacceptable for such a large platform.",0
"What worked before doesn't anymore. Communication with devices is really messed up. It gets disconnected, shows that a different song is playing and doesn't react when I want to skip one. I use Spotify with my car, tv, watch and headphones so this is really frustrating...",0
I like Spotify because I don't know any better,1
"Recently, the app regularly stops playing in the background. My Playlist just stops, seemingly for no reason.",0
"I'm not sure what the recent update has done but it now stops randomly, which, is super convenient for me, but dangerous if other people are experiencing this on the road and attempting to reopen. I appreciated some features of the new update but it seems to have wrecked the app - this is faster than providing feedback to customer service. It's June 26, now. Y'all aiight? Blink twice if you need help.",0
I've tried all the music apps and this is the best one keep up the good work Spotify!,1
"Very good app I can find songs easily , add free .",1
"Here also to complain about last update. In my phone music stops if the screen is locked and generally it is buggy. Been long time user and I like a lot the app, but if this continues it is a deal breaker to me",0
Same as a previous recent review. The recent update has caused the song controls to disappear whenever my phone screensaver activated. Also causing issues with Bluetooth connectivity. Please fix soon.,0
It will not play unless player is open. Where are the player controls??? I've been a PREMIUM FAMILY SUBSCRIBER FOR 10 YEARS.,0
Terbaik,1
Very greatful app for song.. And also i request to you please add one feature also to identify any songs.. Especially it is very helpful to identity edited ringtone amd songs... Because i think some people's are knowing nice music and songs through the 1 minute or 30 second edited status video from the whatsapp.. Instagram etc... I hope you try to add a feature to identity musics&songs .. Really iam still enjoying your apps,1
Very good App,1
Great app and music choses top class,1
It was good before but things changes instantly in this world,1
Superb you ask and you get it very useful whilst morning walk.,1
The listening experience is great but I cannot search for any new song/artist as I am stuck with 'No internet connection available' on a high speed WiFi connection. Tried every hack available on the internet to no avail. I'm a Premium member FYI,0
I think it comes down to preference but I enjoy using Spotify more than other music platforms and do recommend at least trying spotify.,1
"It was good, was beautiful, easy to access your Playlist to play, the sound is so pure.",1
Premium duo subscription simply does not work,0
Wish you could watch music videos. But definitely a nice range of music options. I even found songs for my 4 year old and newborn.,1
"I have been an avid spotify user since 2010, and I can't have anything negative to say. I used many other music apps and this has by far been my favorite since Highschool. I do believe I will not change from here. And premium has been worth every penny from me. Over 8 years straight of premium and still again no negative things to say!! SPOTIFY KEEP UP THE TUNES SO I CAN KEEP UP MY VOLUME!!",1
"Update 30/06/22 - I've been a Premium user now since October '21 and it has been an awesome ride of discovery and rediscovery across the musical spectrum for me! If you have the change, try out Spotify and you won't regret it because it's worth every penny in my view. There are plenty of lesser known artists in this that mainstream is absolutely clueless about which is good of Spotify to include in their catalogue. At Â£9.99 it's like paying for access to the biggest record collection ever!",1
"A library that doesn't have categories, so I have to search for everything. Ad's in Podcasts from Spotify for paying customers, despite a no ads promise.",0
"So annoyed with this app, I can't even listen to songs I want to listen to because it needs to play ""suggested songs"" and when I watch the ad for a half hour of ad free music, I can't switch to a different album, I'm moving to Amazon music, if zero stars is an option I would choose that",0
This is best app for music friends AAP isme apni plalist bena sekte hai or yeh playlist ke tipe ke songs aapko suggest kerega thank you for your app,1
I love how Spotify is supporting free speech. It's the only reason I switched from Pandora.,0
Amazing app It might go premium soon but its amazing even without premium ,1
it's the best music platform out there no doubt,1
Unimpressed. Where is the bar that shows me what is playing? Where can I select a song I want to hear from my Playlist? How do I turn off the random selection on my Playlist. I hate this app.,0
"I have a Samsung S22 ULTRA and use Spotify premium. Spotify now behaves like a broken record... It 'skips' when I play it on an external speaker. And for some reason, it no longer shows what's playing or let's me stop the music without restarting my phone. Come on Spotify. You should be getting better and not the other way. GET YOU ACT TOGETHER!",0
Great app. Good connectivity,1
Its good,1
"App usually is great, but latest version is super buggy, when music plays the bottom control bar goes away and you can see or control what is playing. Super disappointing",0
Good but not really any of the hip hop mixtapes that artists put out for free,0
One of the best music ðŸŽµ in play Store. No one can beat Spotify. Some of the best features are 1. Less Ads 2. Very Smooth UI. 3. Best Recommendations 4. Almost all songs available in Spotify.,1
I love the app but I have a high end android phone and still have not received the lyrics update even though I have premium,0
"It's a very nice music app, really I enjoyedðŸ˜Š",1
Poor performance..... automatically songs where stops....,0
I built MY library of MY favourite tracks and then Spotify decided they knew better than me what I want to listen to.....wrong! Completely ruined it.....thanks for not giving a 'S' about the people who use your product.,0
Can there be a way to see a list of only our own playlists in our library? (On our profile we can only see the public ones) It's a mess the way it's mixed with other people's playlists we've liked,0
Not completely clear on login something wrong,0
love this,1
"Listened to a song for a few seconds to see how it is. The playlist from which the song was, is now stuck on my home screen under 'Your Shows'. I cant even remove it. Irritates me everytime I open the app.",0
Never I Have a new phone without Spotify. I love music and this is the gate to access all of it. Just simply amazing experience,1
Plain simple-great /////simply -plain /////great -simple -Plain & Simple !!!!!! Ty from an old horse,0
"I've been a paid subscriber for many years, something isn't right these days. For some reason there are times that Spotify just will not open. It will constantly say there are too many devices with offline music and it's just not working correctly anymore. It used to be great until earlier this year. I could put up with some quirkiness, but it's pretty much useless on most of the phones I have. I hope they fix it.",0
My playlist is almost 700 songs. I feel like I'm listing to the same 20 songs. THE SHUFFLE SUCKS.,0
"I'm a free user, everything was great. Earlier there used be 30 mins ad free music experience. That was really amazing.. Too much of ad these days. The Tamil translation is horrible. And sometimes there is romanized lyrics for tamil songs which is of no help ,yet for korean songs you can try to romanize them too.. Or maybe 2 options for the user to view in romanized lyrics and the other in its orginal language.. Edit: The tamil lyrics is as horrible as it was before.. Kindly update it.",0
I've never use any other music app. I'm very happy with spotify so far.,1
Good app but now song lyrics wrong having à®ªà®¾à®Ÿà®²à¯ à®µà®°à®¿à®•à®³à¯ à®¤à®µà®±à®¾à®• à®‰à®³à¯à®³à®¤à¯ *Note this*,0
Little to no access to actual new music. Spotify only has access to the pushed pop artists and will give you only those artists. It will not introduce you to new music or artist as they come out unless it already has a contract to promote that BUT NOT by your actual taste unless your taste already matches that mainstream wash of the consumers of guided & limited controlled entertainment.,0
Fantastic ðŸŽµ. Music for every occasion - always brings you in the right mood ðŸ¥° - love it â¤ï¸.,1
I try to put on a Playlist and it says (this Playlist is empty) & when I put a song on it doesn't play. Spotify better be on the verge of fixing this cause it's the summertime I need my music Don't piss me off Spotify Get it fix,0
"I have had Spotify since it was in beta and contending with iTunes. Let me just say there is no competition anymore. Spotify is the only music streaming service worth using. You can set song quality for smaller downloads and save millions of songs. This music service holds a special ""spot"" in my heart. Pun intended. ðŸ˜€",0
PLEASE PUT THE PLAY/PAUSE BUTTON BACK IN THE CENTER. THIS IS THE MOST ATROCIOUS DESIGN CHANGE EVER AND I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.,0
"This new update is sucks, it keep playing random song from playlist that we choose. I more like the old one and I'm giving 4 star for this.",0
I mean the actual Spotify experience is awesome but the fact that I get 6 months free because Walmart Plus customer and then have to go through all these things and I put different cards on when it keeps trying to charge me for the Free Premium trial for 6 months cuz apparently you can't charge me there's money in my account I Find it highly insulting when I'm not even supposed to be charged to begin with that's what I get for being a Walmart Plus customer,0
I love this app because it has all my favorite songs on it.,1
Moving the play and skip buttons was a bad move. There's no reason for it. It's unnecessary,0
"""I love this app! Its great! It makes me listen to my favorite songs and music. Its easy to use, accesible, and reliable"" -what i would say if this app actually works. It doesnt even play the songs that i played. It plays a totally different one. The app is actively FORCING me to buy premium buy how? Not working. Literally impossible to use without premium. This app belongs in the trash along with youtube. They'd make great friends.",1
Need a very very very high connection,0
Clear music you can find the music you like on here I recommend,1
"I have used this apple for 7 month's, and i don't know why they make desktop users select any song for free and for mobile, they have to make it by shuffling through the entire album for the song you want, and the worse part, you get 6 skips an hour, and i thought when i sit my phone for 2 hours, it will give me 12 skips, but no, it still gives you 6 skips",0
"Random crashing during my songs are a big no-no and Spotify you have been doing that lately. Also, what is the point of me selecting shuffle, if it's going to shuffle in the same order!?? It's like I know what song will play next on shuffle.. Like seriously. I am about this close to u subscribing and going somewhere else!!",0
I have made my payment for week subscription through upi and got credited from my account.But i didn't get the premium at all. It's still written as your current plan is Spotify free... Why is it like this.....? Will you please do something...,0
Great music and in listen to pod cast for various options,1
It's where everyone should go for music. 'nough said.,0
I use spotify every single day. Also get Premium,1
"Horrible company, horrible app. I've had nonstop crashes, freezing, and just general bugginess and breaking that they have shown no indication over the entire year to fix. Why are you taking all the money from artists if you're not even going to use it to maintain your platform. I guess having alt-right conspiracy nuts on Joe rogan is a more important use of spotify's money in their opinion. Edit: They've updated the app quite a few times now. Broke it more each time. Edit: can I leave -3 stars",0
"I like the app and really don't have a problem about the ads but it forces me to shuffle when I'm on a Playlist and won't let me choose what song I want to listen to or starts of with when listening. I'm on android and I don't have a problem with this on my chromebook. Please fix this problem, ty.",0
It won't play my mix or sometimes song that I'm searching for. Itll just play some random songs. I recommend you just download spotify on your pc,0
"Please fix the apps, can't have premium subscriptions.",0
The best music app. I am really comfortable using it,1
Great app for listening to music or for parties! I would definitely recommend to a lot others to use this app.,1
"""Watch this commercial you'll get 30 minutes of uninterrupted play"". I DID watch the commercial! about 10 minutes later, ANOTHER commercialðŸ˜³!!! I DIDN'T get 30 minutes of interrupted play.!!! What made my experience at Spotify unpleasant, song list with songs you wanted or not and when they add songs to my list it's usually people I never even heard of!!!ðŸ¤¬ I'm going to check out other music apps. I don't like playing my music and then hearing music I don't like that was chosen by Spotify!!! ðŸ˜•",0
No progress on this offline mode...: Offline/slow internet loading should be quicker. Why does the loading spinner happen for so long when I'm looking for offline library content? Podcast playing on downloaded offline mode is busted. Thanks!,0
The best feature - group session queue... And you have completely broken it.,1
Used to love this app here recently it pauses my music and it doesn't let me skip songs and sometimes (more times than sometimes) it doesn't connect to my truck. Seriously considering trying the you tube premium.,1
Continuously playing for about 60 seconds. Kindly tell us whether we wanna use this application or not. One or two ad is fine... But this is totally annoying,0
The best app for music i luv it super app all language music is here â¤,1
"Love this Joe Rogan Experience app, haven't used it for music yet.",0
This is the best music and podcast app to use,1
"Worst place to listen to podcasts. Do not expect to pick up where you left off cause Spotify can't even get there timestamp right. Very glitchy all of the time and never works the same way twice, GOOD LUCK",0
This app is best I dont care what others are saying about this app but I just love it,1
"Some of the songs I would like only have covers, and often crashes while using",0
"It asks me if i want to watch a short add for 30min of ""un interutpped"" listening i watch the add and 2 songs later i get another add.",0
"Spotify does it's job. People always seem to complain about little minor things, but to have options and pick your favorite music is spot on.",1
I hate how there's adverts then 2 songs you can't skip. I'm sorry but I'm not buying premium either. The app use to be better. Now it's horrible,0
"It's a good app, but I do have a couple of problems with it. It works great and all, it's just that when you click on a playlist, you can't see every song that's in the playlist. I feel like that's the entire point. And you can't play songs in order. It's only shuffle play, nothing else. And if you search up a song, it shows the playlist for it instead of the song. For instance, if you searched ""Lost Boy"", it would give you ""Lost Boy playlist"" instead. It's good for basic use, though.",1
"The downloaded music did not turn on when I got on the plane after the update, why was it normal with this in the previous version?",0
It has great music and I like it ðŸ‘â˜ºï¸ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€congrats to the programer or programers ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽˆðŸŽˆðŸŽ‰âœ”ï¸,1
"I am seriously considering looking for another music streaming aap. For weeks player keeps vanishing. Can't control this aap, pause or stop playing. It's not free application. This is ridiculous.",0
I enjoy spotify over youtube. It seems that you can listen to clear songs without interuption of advertisements. I really love spotify.,1
Good,1
"App full of bugs for weeks (eg I can't use Enhanced because it says I don't have Internet connection when I clearly have, the player is often not showing...)",0
"I really like it. It has generally all the songs I've looked into. But bugs in the app lead me to lower my rating. For example, I drive to work using this app and it just stops all the time. Great app can easily be a 5 star with a little more care.",0
Almost all the lyrics aren't synced.,0
They have all the songs I like! I 100% recommend installing this app,1
"Favorite App To Use For Music. Only thing a find weird is how you can do things on computer like shuffle off/on, repeat off/on, and choose song for free but for a phone, its different. You should make the phone like the conputer.",0
"None of my podcasts are playing at all, my songs keep pausing at random times and then starting again. I have spotify premium, and even my downloaded songs/podcasts aren't working properly. It's not something wrong on my end because I've done everything I can think of to fix the problem. I also looked up what might be wrong and apparently other people are having the exact same problem. Spotify better fix this, I don't want to have to switch music apps but I will if this continues.",0
Nice experience of music It includes many audio books also Thank you Spotify,1
The app is really good but if you do not have the membership it can toruture you with ads fro every single song especially when you are going to gym. But other than that in the other ways when you have premium membership it is so much better ðŸ™‚. But i have had this problem where the song automatically stops so i request the creator to check it out.,0
"Coming from a ""downloading mp3's to player"" and ""walkman"" era, having a cloud based music system with algorithms to understand your taste in genres is fantastic in this day and age.",1
"Hey , please change your ads , play kannada original songs for the ads not dubbed songs. Have some thought about it , or else it's gonna be big ðŸ‘ so just change or just don't play it .",0
It is only a good app if u have spotify premium,0
"Every person on here can find something they find offensive. If everything someone objects to is removed, there will be nothing left. I am not a fan of Joe Rogan, but also not a fan of a lot of other stuff available through SPOTIFY. Here is a clue folks...if you don't like Joe (or other contributors), don't listen to them. Personally, I like to listen to a variety of content, not just what I agree with, & by doing that, my views may evolve by listening to other than just what MSM feeds us.",0
"It's not working now,fix your app",0
"do more premium account promotions, i will subscribe it every month!",0
"I've never had a problem with spotify until the last update. I can't connect the app to my devices ( tv ,, headphones ,, etc; ) and that's a huge problem for me. either fix it or I'll have to find another service to use",0
"Simply Brilliant, great algorithms, great playlists, more music than I could ever have the time to listen toðŸ‘",1
"Stop asking if I want premium via email. It already sucks you talk about it in every other way so just stop lol. Also you guys suck at shuffling. Edit: the app is so glitchy for me and my friend, so this is definitely an app problem and not a personal problem ðŸ˜’",0
Ends podcast playing at random times. So annoying to try and return to where I was on the podcast because it says I completed it and not even be halfway through.,0
Best app to listen whatever music ðŸ™‚ðŸ‘.,1
The commercials are atrocious.,0
I'm really impressed with the music I'm hearing everyone and then.. it's so clear it's so original.. thanks SPOTIFY more power.,1
Awesome,1
Everything thing is perfect but ads ðŸ˜…,1
"I'm also sick of songs stopping and starting but more pissed at having to delete the app and reloading it because the song that's playing bit at the bottom disappears and leaves you with no way of pausing or stopping the song. Only way to stop it playing is to delete the app and reload it, it then works ok for a while. Then you go to reuse it and it's disappeared again. All that and I'm paying for premium......well not for long, if it doesn't get sorted I'll be cancelling very shortly.",0
Unbelievable selection and great Playlists. Haven't found song yet that isn't on her,0
Still has some bugs I suggest looking more into the bottom line that suggest new fixes to the less proficient,0
Spotify as we all know was great. WAS up until this new update I can't pick songs and I thought picking a Playlist would work but nope songs I didn't even add are on it. I didn't even know this update was a thing up until I got a new phone cause on my tablet and laptop I don't have to worry about this. Literally the only reason people use Spotify is to avoid this. If we wanted to not know our next song we'd use Pandora,0
Why is the app so awful to navigate? Especially for podcasts.,0
We want a new look on Spotify for all devices Like Phone iPad Laptop And PlayStation,0
Totally worth deleting. Too many ads for something that is not user friendly. Makes no sense. It's like they deliberately make it suck and i cant figure out why.. especially when the app on my computer is pretty nice. Oh well. At least i still have Pandora!,0
After recent update can't play a song when play app crash kindly slove,0
Good app use it,1
I pay for premium and lately its been very aggressive about pausing my music whether im on wifi or data. Its been happening to alot of people ive talked to as well. Please fix it,0
"Spotify is wonderful,I can listen to a large variety of music or jam only on my favorite melody. Spotify is my choice of happy listening.",1
"Since updating our phones, Spotify has become my go-to music app. I have a library of music that covers a wide range of interests. We use it all the time in my car and while at work.",1
My Playlist are just amazing and the bad bunny Playlist ofcccc,1
"Less than basic features, limited song skips, way too many ads, adds random songs to my playlist no replay button. Overall not worth.",0
"Would've gave 5 stars if Spotify completely supported Joe Rogan's freedom of expression and didn't delete those 71 episodes. I'm not a fan of many of those guys either, but Rogan's podcast is supposed to be free speech/free thought and he should have total artistic control. Spotify has stood behind Rogan, which is good, but they should be completely hands off with no censorship whatsoever. Leave JRE alone.",0
"I deleted spotify and downloaded it again approx. 2 weeks back and I haven't been log in to my account ever since then. 1) No there is no server or network issue at my end. 2) I was able to log in on the web version of spotify in opera browser in my laptop which means the issue is in the app. 3) I have tried changing my password, using OTP and even direct link that I got in my email but all were unsuccessful and everytime it throwed an error. Please look into it and reply.",0
"One of the most premium apps giving superior value to customers in the music space. Surely, Spotify today is all music lovers' delight. There is no compromise on the quality of music for the Spotify Premium customers.",1
There is some bug in android where the play/pause button just isn't visible,0
"Great service for music and podcasts, app can be buggy though. It especially has trouble playing through cars (not just mine) over Bluetooth but once I get it started it usually keeps playing.",0
For those who are tired of the ads provide by Spotify. Just simply download Spotify from happy mod it's 100% safe and secure and it's exactly the same as the original version you will never get ads and you can also download your favourite songs ðŸ‘Š[thank me later â˜ºï¸],1
Always problems with this app,0
Excellent best music service out there,1
The app is always having problems playing audio pausing and skipping and it doesn't alway connect to anything Bluetooth.,0
i hate it wen i want to listen to one specific song it plays a random one insted ðŸ˜¡,0
"Can't download a single song in the album , you can only download an entire album. What's this rubbish and the it cost 1000 bucks a year",0
Nice,1
Showing adds in kannada channels with telugu songsðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” Then remove kannada language from your Application. We have many applications those who supports kannada songs and language.,0
"Pls delete or give us a way to disable the ""shows to try"" tab. It takes half my display when i start the app and it suggests random stuff i dont want to see... thank you",0
Dear Spotify Devs A very big request to you all that please please please add gravero s HindiXEnglishmashup songs in your app,1
Spotify is good but it never starts in one go always shows me your offline even though my internet is in good condition ðŸ˜« please do something about it,1
"New update sucks! My music turns off randomly but starts back up when I unlock my phone. There's no ""now playing"" screen either, so I can't go to the next song!",0
Since its stupid automatic payments I'll be listening for the next month. But if this constant crashing and glitches aren't fixed I will be leaving this app. I'd rather pay for an app that works.,0
November 2021 update messed with the friend feed and STILL hasnt been fixed ffs,0
Good old is gold songs â¤ï¸,1
This is very nice and extreamly awesome app.,1
App seem a bit broken on the newest Android os. In my car it suddenly starts playing even if I had exited the app 10min before that. Other app is also having difficulty to get audio through since Spotify is not giving away its position as the main player for some reason.,0
"Cannot log in after creating an account in the UK and moving to the US, and the unhelpful error message is ""something went wrong.""",0
It's great. I just wish when you vist a artist profile you had a option to see every song they have (on the platform) in like one playlist or something.,1
Worst music app . I like Amazon music much better. They keep on piping adds after every 2 songs . You can't hear songs peacefully unless you area premium user . Such bad interface . I don't recommend using this app,0
Too many ads.. even after 1 song ðŸ˜”,0
The best thing ever my mom had gaana i told her to install Spotify but she said no without realising gaana's premium is more than Spotify and has less ads,0
Worst experience ever. Very hard to search and find the song you want. Too many ads. Need to work more on it.,0
Why does it for my laptop and my tv but not for my phone unlimited skips,0
"Everything I listen to is through Spotify. Love the format. However, there is 1 flaw. Some songs you can't get from Spotify.",0
"Loving this app, wondering where I was all these time. I can get to hear the great speeches of Martin Luther King Jr and others. Am hooooooooooooooooked",1
"It's been overall great improvement within couple of years and audio quality is great. The app synchronise between devices perfectly and I love this feature to switch between devices while playing song. I only thing I found weak is song suggestions, though I am using this app from couple of years but still it doesn't recommend or make an auto playlist which I like and groove. Please start using better AI so it can suggest and make better playlist for different users.",1
Good selection of music and works with all my devices,1
The app is good so far but I need to make use of it very well.,1
"Improve your search engine and get rid of those annoying ""buy premium now""",0
Love the choices. Plays well in my car and home. Just wish I could afford it again. Times are tough for some of us.,1
Very nice to listen to music,1
likeee,1
I have been using spotify for 1-2 years and it is only getting good not bad. My favourite music app is Spotify. It is better than amazon prime music. Every update is getting good. I love it so much spotify.,1
I hate this app after every song i play im getting an add like wth whenever i add a song to my playlist it goes down to the bottom so i cant even listen to the songs i added recently.bout to delete this app,0
Ads are very annoying,0
Good selection of songs. Only drawback is in weaker signal takes a while to open,0
"Great app but what the hell is it with the ads, repeating 1 after another and now ads popping up after everysong instead of every 30mins ðŸ˜¡",0
it's difficult to creat an acc it's just like wasting time,0
Good app for listening song,1
It keeps adding random songs to my play lists edit: I decided to come back from originally posting my review in 2020 and check if I could listen to doctor who big finish and there is an amazing 8th doctor playlist on here. Still keeps adding random songs though. Two years later same problem.,1
New update causes streaming to stop playing and videos to not play,0
Add to Playlist option doesn't appear when connected via Android Auto. Not sure if its the car or the app...,0
At first was smooth running and enjoy to use this apps for premium but since last month could not pay for premium. Always failed. What happen with spotify?,0
Love the variety and listening to whole albums.,1
"What is there NOT to Like?? -- This app is Very Intuitive as to what I am thinking, what I want, & when I want it, -- wish I Could say the Same About my Girlfriend. Lol",1
"Selection awesome, waze integration nice, interface worst i have ever seen. Premium seriously needs voice control built in so i can drive safely with out google assistant.",0
"I have very eclectic musical tastes and Spotify connects me to music I love from all genres and eras. It has also been a wonderful way for me to connect musically with my son as we expand each other's musical universe. I find it also has more content in my favorite genres such as old reggae, than the other leading service. I joined Spotify a few years ago and it has improved my life in so many great ways.",1
Super,1
"It was alright at first but the fact it adds randoms songs to your PERSONAL playlist and wants you to pay for premium, why not just use youtube? I barely use my phone so i can use youtube on a closed google tab on pc to listen to music ad free (usually) and it doesnt add random songs or videos to your playlist. And you dont have ad videos! So i dont see the point in spotify.",0
It's a good app and I like the fact that I get every song I want to..,1
Reduse some ads,0
"User interface is perfect and content is great, but it's disappointing that the world's most popular streaming service has the worst sound quality. Hifi audio is long overdue here",0
Love the Spotify they have all the music I love,1
The beat app to listen to music and vibe to whatever genre your ears will certainly like! ðŸ‘Œ,1
"Easily my favorite music app, Spotify is the best in my opinion. The simple user interface, super deep catalog of music/podcasts and it's well worth the subscription to not hear the commercials ðŸ‘",1
"Nice app ðŸ‘ I would say best ever UI ever scene, even that concept of advertisement between songs are not so creepy as YouTube â˜ºï¸, they are funny as well. Thanks Spotify for providing a great service from yours side.",1
"$POTIFY: You can't even view an albums tracklist unless you give them money first. And you'd think listening to a bunch of their ads would earn you some free listening, not exactly â€” If you listen to a bunch of their ads, they'll let you here a few random songs of their choice, that's it. A better idea would to download YouTube Music â€” It let's you play any song, skip songs, even view an album's track list without paying a penny. Plus it has way more music.",0
"Unable to update payment. Use it for years. Previously working fine and right now they only restricted to telco based only on the recent . Because previously, i only subscribe via visa card. Which to me is isn't user friendly. Im switching to Joox. If Joox doesn't work out, i will go back to old method by uploading to the phone. People decided to use you because of the range and can play with sharing method. But if you block like this, it would be a bad for your business and user experience.",0
Very good app and have nice collections,1
its super cool its one thing wrong the songs should be 1 hour or more,0
Too much pub,0
Currently running into a bug when connecting to anything Bluetooth or via my car w/Android Auto. Heavy issues playing music. Ending up needing to restart my phone multiple times to fix its issue. No currently playing bar showing up in the app or externally.,0
You know why,1
The new update kills onboard loudspeaker on phone when locked or unlocked. Switches sound to headset only. To fix you have to kill application and then restart and not lock or unlock your phone or switch to a different app. Spotify becomes as useful as pulling music on regular YouTube. I am paying for premium!!!,0
Edit. Song bar issue resolved . 5 star rating re-instated !,0
App keeps crashing. Had to cancel my subscription and uninstall hope that it gets fixed bc I like it but don't like it crashing while listening to music as I skip to the next track,0
"Since last update, the app has been ""running"" horribly. Fix this problem and the app is 5 stars Update: updated on the 13th, STILL NOT FIXED.",0
"Too many ads. Five or more ads every 1-2 songs. Used to be tolerable, not anymore.",0
"I couldn't log in my account. It always say that Im currently set to offline and go online to connect to spotify. Then, it sends an email for me to click but it always says that the link is expired and send a new one even though it is a new one and is supposed to expire 4hrs after it has been sent.",0
"Recent update has made the app unstable. The playing track isn't updating. Constantly crashes, needs restart and randomly stops playing.",0
"Spotify stream good less data consumption fast and good taping ,one thing i dont like is the volume my devices it dosnt boost sounds good the way i want pls let the developer of this App still work on the sounf production thanks",1
Iam really enjoying the music no doubt why it has that much downloads but the advertisement in the middle of the flow nah I wish I could get premium but I couldn't but thank you to spotify for providing great music and readymade playlist thank you guys,1
Love Spotify but recently I don't have a play bar anywhere. Please fix !,0
"As of the past few weeks I have been having a lot of problems with Spotify. Unresponsive, crashing, slow downloads and even slower streaming. Never had these problems until the past month, it's on Spotify's end and I'm really disappointed.",0
awesome this,1
"Do you like your music streaming app that you're paying for crashing more often than necessary? Then Spotify is the perfect choice for you! Even with the screen turned off, it'll just crash and force me to reopen the app and restart the music in the middle of work. But if the app crashing wasn't good enough for you, if you have android 12, Spotify will just beg for more Bluetooth permissions than necessary, and the team is aware of this, but are working at a snails pace to get it fixed.",0
"So many bugs, disconnected from car, have to force stop multiple times and then even then it still stops mid song and doesn't display what you're currently listening to",0
THIS IS A MUST HAPP ON YOUR PHONE OR COMPUTER OR ANY DEVISE YOU HAVE WHERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD SPOTIFY. Althoughit would be a ten star if it would stop playing other random songs that you didn't put up on a playlist,0
Very nice app,1
Music the universal language at my fingertips. Spotify is the backtrack to my visual Mindscapes,1
I like to sleep while playing music so having Spotify premium I can listen to music with no ads unlike YouTube and Spotify it's a playlist of stuff so you don't have to keep on changing the songs,0
Clear crisp audio with uninterrupted 30 minute play.,1
Very convenient for me coz I get to listen to the songs that I love back from the past. Classic man here! ðŸ˜Š,1
Bugs bugs bugs!! The player disappears often leaving the controls dead. Recently had lots of buffer skipping as well,0
"Probably the worst audio app I've used recently. The app keeps having issues with loading when you're connected to the internet and either trying to search or check the home tab. Playing audio sometimes doesn't work, it shows it is playing and when you pause it goes back to where it was before it started playing, because it never played it just agree like it did.",0
"Why, in playlists of 10h of music, I always hear the same musics I heard in the first time? Doesn't matter how many times I press shuffle it keeps playing that same reduced set!",0
"What's up with the latest update keeps crashing have to close the app, play bar disappears, albums play from the start instead of continuing from last played in car etc have to force close it, previous update worked fine!!",0
Awesome music app!! You can add songs to list hear them!!,1
I really like the DJ,1
"Love this app. Wish I could work for Spotify, bet it's a real blast. ðŸ˜œ The only issue I have is the ads. Can't afford to go premium just yet !",0
Amazing songs and artists!!! Great app 10/10 review!!,1
"Free, way better than most paid subscriptions!!!",1
"Wth happened?? I cant shuffle or view my queue at all. This app needs to get fixed very soon or im cancelling it. Ive been a premium custoner for years, by it becoming not worth it with all the technical issues...",0
I  the Spotify app it also has the music  podcasts that I like to listen to,1
Omg you have no idea how much I love this app it is amazing,1
every update genuinely breaks the app for a solid 2 or 3 days until they patch whatever was broken. I'll still stay on premium because the service itself is great but this app needs better quality control.,0
Good music and easy to browse...love it and very useful,1
This app is very good ðŸ‘ I can listen to all my favorite songs ðŸŽµ,1
Loved the app before I started to get ads. I can't skip to the next song until the current song is over because a screen saying the feature is premium. I'd rather get an ad than wait. And now I can't even select a SPECIFIC song from a playlist until I play that playlist and wait for the song I want to play. It's ridiculous how after your money this app is. PC version is better so far.,0
"Nice app, easy to use. Zero issues in my day-to-day use",1
I like the app so far. I should take the time to make more playlist.,0
The best app so far just need to improve on the amount of times you skip,0
I Don't want to write but i Get 2 Ad's and then That 30 mins free one . It's ok but Today This study app Shows me 5 ad's and That 30 min free one too . Glitch or Something i don't understand . So do you think I am here Just For Ad's or Songs,0
No ads all music,0
So I used to be able to tap my Playlist and then pick a song or just pick the first song on the top of my Playlist to restart it now I have to press the shuffle button and it annoying and you can only skip 6 time per hour. Spotify please fix this it used to a 5 star but with this new thing it's a 3. Now I have to listen to pandora.,0
How is it possible to not be able to play the downloaded songs while offline then why did I download it at the first place??,0
The best music app ever!,1
Won't let me pause the music when I open the app,1
It's nice I can listen to my music,1
"NOTHING IS WORKING! I've payed for perimeum for a long time and with the new update everything stopped working, songs won't play, can't see my libray, nothing! I love this app but I wont be paying for this app next month if this isn't fixed!! I've found the web player works but not the app! I pay to download the music for offline but whats the use if the app doesn't work!",0
"It randomly stops playing songs/podcasts since it updated, most of the time it doesn't even show the player that lets you know what song is playing /skip/go back /pause etc, it's just not there, even on my drop down bar it's just a blank ""Spotify"" notification. If my phone is unlocked it will play longer, but I mostly listen when I'm going to sleep and showering, so obviously my phone locks! it's getting really annoying now, absolutely sick of it. please fix it. it was great before.",0
"Cant even pick what song you want. On top of that spotify adds in a ton of songs into your playlist, making the playlist spotify wants not the one you want. Pretty much forcing you to buy premium",0
"Really good , crashes sometimes",1
Music for me changed because of Spotify.,0
Music from Spotify is brilliant,1
"April update absolutely broke this app. Controls disappear, tracks stop playing randomly, etc. Just atrocious.",0
"Absolutely rubbish You choose a song, press play and it plays a completely different song xD",0
"This app is great in so many ways. But Jesus does it glitch. There's so many loading issues that have been going on for months, even when you're offline but have downloaded music, it loads very slow or doesn't at all. Extremely annoying when you pay for your plan and it doesn't even function correctly. Please fix the bugs!!!!",0
"It is not good, but people are there. Some songs are been removed, a pitty!",0
"App has annoying bugs, if device memory is low it would just fill it all up until the phone is out of memory. THERE IS NO WAY TO SET MAXIMUM STORAGE. And Spotify folks are not smart enough to use sensible values.",0
Well sometimes you want lyrics on every song it is not that way always,0
"Its a good app , most of the songs are available in Spotify ,",1
"I like it and all, although when i click a song on my liked songs it only plays the short version??",1
"App overall works good. Problem is I have every notification turned off in the app but for some reason it started to notify me everytime I connect to my vehicle! Also, quite creapy saying, ""Going for a drive?"" Talk about privacy issues!",0
"No longer works on Android Auto! And I have the same problem as other reviewers, the control bar disappears so I can't pause or skip songs.",0
"Finding my favourite songs it has been a blessing for me , even new artists that I was not aware off. Thank you for this app",1
"I bought 1 day premium and downloded some songs, but when my premium ended, all songs that i already downloded were gone.. and when i want to buy 1 day premium again, spotify always error!",0
"I love it, but do think you should pay artist alot more then you do. You make billions. I love all the new artists that you can discover.",1
"As someone who appreciates and relies on music for my overall well-being, I can't go a day without using this valuable app!",1
great app,1
"If I pause my pod but don't close the app, when I return, the Now Playing bar is gone. It appears I am not playing the podcast - shows â–¶ï¸ instead of â¸ï¸ - (even though I audibly am). There's no ability to pause - from my notification bar or in the app. I have to force stop the app each time in order to get the functionality back. I just re-downloaded the app today and am already considering removing it again. ðŸ¥´",0
I love this app but the way there is like 4 adds after one skip even tho it promises to give me 30 minutes of add free music pisses me tf off. App is okay tho ig,1
The app just crashes when I try and log in,0
GREAT,1
this app would be amazing if it weren't for how many adds there are for non premium users its actually so bad i get 7 adds in a row sometimes in-between songs and the same add sometimes plays again straight after it was already played for some reason they are so frequent too and they always use the same exact adds for weeks on end and having to listen to those things so many times a day when i just want to listen to music is driving me insane i literally know them all word for word now,0
Super music app nd awesome ,1
"Very clumsy interface. If one plays a song found through usrr search, there's no way to return to a previous list of songs. ""Radio"" and Spotify suggestion lists cannot be saaved. Good selection of music (better than YTMuzak Premium) although a bit light on 70-80 fusion & some classical (e.g., Philip Glass). Good sound fidelity.",0
wow,1
"The app works ok with no special features or anything to make it distinct, but the the commercials are increasing and I won't pay for the services of a corporation that now wants to be political. Enough with the hypocrisy of the woke and the tech companies that want to play politics! There are dozens of other streaming music apps that all have 4+ star reviews, so I will be deleting Spotify.",0
"I'm more than happy to pay subscription and support artists but this app has got some major issues that needs sorting asap!! I switch between amazon and spotify over the past year, landing back on spotify as it's most compatible with other devices i.e tvs etc but now i can't even see what song is playing, skip songs, etc. Doesn't show on the home screen, as a widget or on my watch. Literally pointless. Back to amazon music for me.",0
"One of my the best music streaming app, so I give it 5.",1
Application is good. Lots of ads and bugs. Please add a song ARCADE X O RE PIYA and Jalraj all songs,0
This suckse you can only skip so many songs and when I listen to my like songs I adds random songs that I don't like,0
"u can't even play a certain song that u want. instead it just plays a preview of the song u picked, but it never play it like as a whole. u can't play individual songs on a playlist without hitting the shuffle button. i hope you bring back the previous version because this update is so bad.",0
App works well but as soon as the screen turns off your music stops playing. Very annoying and I'm thinking of switching from this app to another music app,0
Great app easy to use and an original content. But have always room to get better.,0
"Application is getting worse, even premium. Songs stop playing randomly, screens doesn't show the current song.",0
Audio quality is very poor on home theatre system & car. I thought my Polk RTi speakers were suited only to movies until I listened to old CD's then tried Tidal. Sounds ok on phone.,0
"Spotify is literally the best music streaming app, I've never had any problems with Spotify, it works perfectly fine on my PS4 and phone, I use Spotify every single day, love this app.",1
"The straw that broke the camels back was Spotify deciding that every time I get in my car or my wife takes it out and my phone sees the vehicles BT that I should get an unstoppable push notification asking if I am going for a drive and suggests playlists. Features come and go constantly and I've experienced intermittent bugs or for all I know ""features"" that make the app frustrating to use, but at least until the last few days I didn't have to worry about the constant annoyance notifications.",0
Love this app. Has all my favorites both old and new. Alows me to listen to my eclectic mix of music.,1
"Fix these bugs! It's been super glitchy lately. Not connecting to my car radio, skipping multiple songs when I only wanted to skip one, etc. It used to be my go to music app but now I'm looking for a new one.",0
The best,1
Just masterpiece,1
"I don't know if it's a glitch or a feature in testing, but my pay button is way on the left side with the skip buttons on the right. Please I want it back to normal. Rewind , play, skip.",0
I think Spotify is really good at listening to podcasts and music on,1
"Good, but ads, don't mind them but it is the skipping",1
This so amazing app and mast song,1
I am new to music apps this one is easy to use and has a variety of music thumbs-up,1
"Absolutely nothing wrong....u listen to ur favorite songs, make playlists, and listen to other playlists for free!",1
This app is very interesting good ,1
"There are some major bugs. I have tried uninstalling the app but still there. The control bar disappears, you can't pause, play or skip a tune, but can browse as usual. Very annoying.",0
"App crashes all the time now, play/pause & skip track doesn't work from headphones, no play bar, music randomly stops every few minutes. Please fix!!!",0
Has everything I need,1
Love the app listen all day to music a choose easy no cost way to enjoy music you like,1
It's very difficult to listen a specific song... I have to find in a album and then play... download a song and listen is more then easy and fast then Spotify,0
Untill last update it was awesome. But new update is too bad. They made it complex for the sake of design. It's too difficult to navigate between songs while searching,0
"I don't really like it. I love how it has my songs, but I always have to shuffle and it wouldn't play my favorite songs anymore. I think Soundcloud is better.",0
"I don't get it, my favorite feature is gone. You can't preview songs anymore when creating a playlist!!!! Why??? Kind of pointless now. I'm trying other streaming apps now.",0
It was great app but after last update to LG OLED WebOS screenserver was disabled intentionally what can causes damage of your screed by burning out pixels..sic!,0
best app that I currently use compared to all other music apps... I listen to a lot of underground and new artists that are trying to make a name for themselves along with the current podcasts ... I would never use another app again and I have been with Spotify for well over 5 years and use premium which I've never had issues with... ðŸ˜€,1
I love â¤ï¸ this app a lot because it has a best collection it has a collection of all song around the world and recommendations of this app is superb it makes perfect blend of your favourite beats I use this app mostly than other social media apps 'cause of its perfect UI than other music apps I personally think that the Spotify is the best platform for streaming online songs sometimes for free accounts adds irritates the most but In-spite of this It match with my all expectations perfectly.,1
I've had this app for a few months now and I've loved it until this week it won't even let my pass the logo the screen just turns blank and logs me out.,0
"Never any problems, great array of different genres",1
Won't display the current song playing won't play songs,0
It always tells me I am offline. I know I'm not because all my other apps work fine.,0
It's a good streaming service. Occasionally they remove songs and podcasts that has been downloaded and redownload them again,1
All of my playlists disappeared after my phone updated. What the hell? It took me years to build those playlists. If I can't get them back I am canceling my subscription. Spotify has not been functioning the way it should for months and this is the last straw. I'm done.,0
It is the best music app in playstor,1
Best freemuÃŸicplatform I've ever used!,1
Prefer a platform that doesn't traffic in misinformation. Uninstalled.,1
"Its the best music app I have used, I recomend it to every one of my friends!",1
Couldn't live without it !!! Love the huge choice of music ðŸŽµ,1
"I have Spotify premium and it has been a great experience until now. The app has begun to switch to the next song when Im only half through with the first one, skipping it on its own. It also will pause on its own and not play the next song. I thought it was a wifi problem, but these are downloaded songs. It used to let me play downloaded songs when out pf wifi range but it will no longer play them, making the download feature pointless",0
"I would love to hear any songs for free and download them with a subscription.. To be honest this is a great music app but the only fault that i noticed is that the lyrics of some songs in Tamizh language is wrong and I think that'll create a very bad image on the app itself.. So, I request Spotify to update the lyrics of Tamizh songs and many other language songs in their own language..",0
"premium content. the music is stopping when it is offline, and it's frustrating",0
I love this app I've had it now since it first came out! Best app ever!!!! I love listening to Spotify but I wish it was a little cheaper that's the only thing that I would change â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸,0
Why are so many music Fine and then just... Are unavailable!. why Spotify why?. Please fix it.,0
like love,1
"Buggy. Apps rarely run with the controls in notifications, and when that happen it performs horribly. I've been facing this bug for a while now, and I don't rollback to previous good versions because you know why. It's really frustrating!",0
"Great App except for the recent bugs, I hear the music playing but the bar that shows what im listening to just disappears and one time I was listening to a song and it just restarted randomly. I dont know, maybe this update will fix these bugs.",0
"It was good in all,but I hated how when you make a playlist,it mostly play recommended songs.",0
Been using this for years on premium. Well worth the money until the last year when the scroll wheel stopped working for me. This latest update has fixed that for me and I'm loving it!,1
You'll be listening to a minute up to a minute and a half of commercials for every one or two songs. Otherwise it's a good platform good selection.,1
I love listening to Spotify. They have all kinds of music! Music from when I was a teenager on up and it's great even some oldies golden oldies,1
Love it so much â¤ and thanks for your app!,1
"Since they changed to force you to pay it has gone down hill. You can't really listen to what you want, abs when you can its a 90 sec ad every 2 songs",0
Best music app ever been using for years now,1
I love Spotify I can select what music I want when I want!!,1
Love everything about Spotify,1
"Can't figure out how to get it to play to my car speakers even though bluetooth is connected to my car stereo, but one button at the top of my screen to enable push notifications for ads sooo you can see where the developers heads are at.",0
"Excellent music app, the new design finally works flawlessly and am having 0 problems with it. Thank you!",1
"Its Great app, No complaint so far.",1
"Great service, seems glitchy as of late, app shuts off several times a day and needs to be completely restarted.",0
I It is too good I love it because we can save the songs but we cannot download it .thank you,1
Very good experience using the app. I have premium so I don't see ads. Can listen to podcasts and music. Sometimes Spotify confuses my watch and phone so there is a problem there.,0
"This is making me annoyed.. I tried playing a song and after only one song it will stop and will not continue, you're kidding me. Please fix this, I used to love this app but now it just giving me more stress.",0
Super awesome. I use the worship songs during my prayer time,1
This is one of THE amazing app for me and I love this. And I always listen songs in it that I can even stop myself from listening listening it. I love songs. But there is there is one thing that is stopping me from giving it a 5 star is the adds that always running my joy it does annoying me a little too much. Other wise it's great. And i love it,1
"2 current issues: I have it shuffle my Playlist, doesn't even play through it once completely before it starts playing songs not on my Playlist. I expect to hear this Playlist at least twice before other songs get jumbled in. 2- an ad pops up with the message ""watch this ad for 30 minutes uninterrupted listening"" one song later, a couple 30 and 15 second ads start playing. False advertising there.",0
"If I could have only one app on my phone, it would be Spotify. Spotify premium is easily the best subscription service ever.",1
"its okay no bad condition , and so good to use that's why i rate this spotify 5stars ðŸ’–",1
too much ad ðŸ˜ƒ just after 2-3 song I get literally 3 ads all together one by one. honestly it's so annoying :/ I wouldn't mind if I only got 1 ad but 3??!??!!?! also we still don't have Canvas in India yet and I can't see the clips :( it sucks,0
It seems to be messing up my Bluetooth connection for other sources. I need to be be able to disable the takeover it seems to want.,0
I enjoy the seemless experience of the app.,1
Best music app!,1
Best app for listening songs :),1
"THE ENCHANCE FEATURE IS MY FAVORITE PART OF SPOTIFY , WHY WAS IT RANDOMLY REMOVED. I CAN'T SEE IT ANYMORE FIX IT",0
I love this app. It's amazing but the reason I gave it 4 stars is the removal of the loop button. I'd love the app to bring it back without us paying just for that one button which will last like 1 month or something. The app made me disappointed due to the useless removal. And if love if we wouldn't pay for the offline listening too because it's just a uselss removal (again) . The app is amazing but needs those little things back just for the sake of it. I honestly think these removals a bad.,0
Very good app to hear music,1
"Best in its class,with high defined and enormous collection of all genres of music ðŸŽ¶.",1
Commercials are getting more and longer. Price for premium is to high to go to. But better then just the radio.,0
"To all those experiencing issues, I was struggling with the same. I contacted twitter who looked at this issue for me suggested I log out restart the phone then log back in and this has worked. Hope this helps ðŸ˜ They were great and very supportive !",1
Love all the music that's available.,1
A good app. Easy to use. A variety of music genre.,1
"I use this app on a daily basis for music. Trying to listen to podcasts is increasingly difficult though. The ads within the episodes are almost twice the volume of the people telling the podcast, making it very difficult to want to listen to them.",0
"Absolutely duck this service. Sick and tired of losing my music on deployments, trips, and times when I need it most.",0
I love this app because this app was very useful to relax and enjoy the rest of the day,1
"I downloaded Spotify, and enjoyed it for a Time. Unfortunately, the direction that Spotify is moving toward is not a good one. They are now actively allowing the spreading of lies on their platform. These lies have the potential to kill people. They are not only complacently flies that they are allowing to be spread but they are actively defending their harmful mistake. Shame on you, Spotify. I had high hopes for you, but our time together is done. I've officially canceled my subscription.",0
"Used to be good, now it's meh... Used to be able to use local stored songs in offline, but now it still stops and skips if internet is lost despite in ""offline mode"" and songs stored locally .... + The app recently started just closing mid playing .. + I can get the app to close when I want it too, but have to ""Force close"" it..... ... It even started playing without any open interface, impossible to stop... only Forced close worked ... Keep it up and I'll soon be looking for a better service.",0
Best app for listening music and create good song suggestions,1
It would be 5 stars but I cant figure out how to arrange the songs in my play list if there even is a way.,0
"This app is the best music app I have ever seen but there are some covers which are not here like ""Sure thing"" by BLACKPINK and ""Clarity"" by Jisoo...Pls update those in the app...other then this everything is awesome â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸",1
"The spotify party invites rarely work, connects 1/20 times and there doesn't seem to be a reliable way to connect. I press the invite link and it turns on Spotify but doesn't join the party.",0
"Love it , though would love more old stuff too",1
Love that I can find ANY song... Going down memory lane!,1
"Has gotten better over time, but certain bugs like shared playlists not showing up in the list have been present for ages.",0
Love love love Spotify from day one!,1
"The play bar keeps disappearing. Only restarting the phone fixes it, but then it disappears again. This problem has been known for 2 months and still not fixed",0
Seems to only play 30 second clips. Uninstalled,0
"Constantly stops playing, except when it keeps playing but doesn't display the song or any way to control it until you kill and reopen it. Come on Spotify, there should not be this many issues in an app like this!",0
The app is very good and has all my fav songs but it's very hard to listen to songs and overall very difficult and confusing to use,0
"WHY HAVE YOU MOVED THE PAUSE TO THE LEFT AND THE SKIP TO THE MIDDLE, this is by far the most nonsensical and absurd update I've ever seen. I can't even begin to fathom the thought process that went into this update; the only somewhat logical explanation is that Spotify is trying to annoy the consumers enough to warrant angry tweets about it in order to gain traction. I won't change to another music service because Spotify has the best UI (apart from this) by a long shot, so please, FIX IT!!!",0
"Pretty solid app, except for podcasts that will consume evry inch of your datas.",1
I can't see the play button and I don't want to do random and the new update sucks u need to pay to skip your songs and put they put ads I'm deleting Spotify it trash now. U can't pick the music u want. Spotify is Trashhhhhhhhh,0
"I have had an ""Internet connection not available"" for two days now but internet is working just fine. Nothing I do works but I still got charged. Are your servers down for good or what",0
"Y'all should add some features that will make the app incredible. One, add a feature that can allow users to play all offline songs. Two, add a supermix. And three, add two tabs on the home page that will say ""music"" and ""podcast"" it's time to separate music from podcast. Also, make it easy to download podcast episodes. I want to enjoy a podcast show without any pausing(buffering). Maybe auto download.",1
Why can't I tell it to stop defaulting to the same Playlist everytime? Cant get away from the same few songs repeating OVER and OVER!! Delete suggested Playlist maybe? No options. Fix please,0
"Very slow, when I'm connected to my speaker, the audio starts to lag and i have to close and open spotify again for the audio to be okay again. Kinda disappointed for how much it costs per month.",0
Spotify is not an app thats good to have without premium though if you use the web player it gets better but i like the app very much i don't really have feedback,0
Good acha h yee,1
"Generally enjoyed so far, but eagerly anticipating better sound quality....",1
I Like it its just there's too much advertising but its fine after that,1
Why is my spotify unavailable for listening in my alexa echo dot device now?? Everything was good until I updated it. Isn't an update means development? Then why suddenly it stopped working with my alexa device?,0
"Garbage app on android, colour banding everywhere and no feature parity (swipe to queue etc).",0
Nice app to listen music it was useful for lovers ðŸ˜,1
Looks like they've fixed most of there performance issues but occasionally when I go to listen to a podcast instead of going to the last episode I listened to it goes to the very first episode,0
Music Streaming just got better.,1
Love the broad option of musical choices,1
Best experience nice quality,1
"Spotify is great but when I want to hear a specific song, it plays a different song, Idk if it's just me.",1
the music plays very well and is smooth.,1
Love it instantly installe Spotify is fire.,1
Love it when I was looking for something else,1
Free . InterReality. Essential.,1
"This use to be a good music app, but lately I cant get through one song without it cutting in and out 40 times per song. REALLY ANNOYING BAD SPOTIFY ðŸ¤¬",0
Enjoy listening to 70 music and my grandbabies enjoy silly kids songs ðŸŽµ ðŸŽ¶,1
Very very happy with Spotify....,1
I can't like go back to songs like it will play them outta order it's messed up its not the same now there's to many ads no I didn't get premium so could u please fix this,0
"Their team support won't be able to fix the issue when you try to get a premium plan. They won't be able to do anything when the system give you a message ""Address is invalid."" I've talked to different people from the support team, but on one can do anything about that. They asked the same questions like talking to a robot, but they couldn't fix the issue. Please don't say that you are sorry if you can't hire someone to fix the issue.",0
Spotify keeps crashing and I can't see the song I'm playing on my notification bar.,0
"Easy to use, song quality excellent",1
"Spotify is a good app but there are some things that alrvery annoying that you might want to put into consideration before downloading. When u first download Spotify you get Id say around a month of good quality: few ads, unlimited skips, skip to any point in a song and restart songs whenever. But after that trial is up, you get more ads, (2 30s long before every playlist and more during the playlist) you only get 6 skips per hour, cant replay a song, AND it doesn't play ur songs in order etc.",0
Great quality but the ads are annoying,0
I don't how this app work no more when u have spotify premium like some of .y song is not working on my playlist i hate it how it is i like the update but i still having problems with my music i love to here even it happens when it be on it i starting to hate this app they need to fix it,0
This app is so bad. You only get 6 skips per hour but yet they add 10+ random songs to your playlist. You can't even put your song on repeat.,0
"It's good for streaming music for your Xbox, pc, and the like but you can't play a specific song, it adds songs to playlists automatically, and the ads are nonstop. But besides that, it does the job.",1
Very gooD,1
Best music application ever. Some of the music I enjoy listening to isn't not on here but still the best. Good enough for me to spend money on and I don't like to spend money,1
Very good app its just that the ads get pretty annoying on mobile. Like i get more ads on mobile than on the desktop app which kills my vibe when i gotta listen to ads for 2 minutes after i get a good song on my playlist,0
I don't know what happened between now and last month. But here lately spotify has taken away my chance to control what I listen to. Meaning no play nor skip buttons seem to appear as they use to. It seems to go in car mode even when not in a carðŸ¤” please fix this issue.,0
The app bugs out on galaxy s22 ultra.,0
It's the best app for listening to musics but It would've been better if you could see the clip of the music fully but it still the best,1
I love to listen songs on spotify,1
"Day by day this app user friendly getting poor.. i don't find now playing window in app, hard to find it... Please keep basic features rather than advancing it. I'm premium member for 2 years",0
It is bad one day we added just was on my play list and I couldn't turn it off plus the we added songs was nothing like what I like to listen to but before that happened it was a 4 star,0
wont let you play songs without premium  screw you spotify,1
I love Spotify! Especially for my get togethers. I make a Playlist and just let it run! I also use it for my podcast Lifeofy. My mother uses it as well and my kids for workouts and parties!!! Love how you can que songs so everyone can hear something they want!,1
One of the best music playing apps,1
I love it,1
Great app. Even the free side of it is awesome.,1
The now playing bar is gone. The app is now useless,0
Exceptional but slow,0
"I've used Spotify for probably 9 years now, it's earned the 5 stars. Great app, free version and premium!",1
This app is my main source for music and podcasts and anything audio that I need. It is better than Amazon music. I'm really considering giving Chinese New Year gifts of Spotify premium trials or month subscriptions to my closest family and my 2 best friends. I did the free trial and realized how much my life has been enriched by having excellent access to all of my audio entertainment all in one place. Developing an algorithm that reaches underground artist in mixed genres would be a godsend.,1
I love to listen to Spotify. It has all the right artists and song's. Couldn't ask for anything better. Thank you,1
It has a lot of glitches and sometimes it just flat out doesn't work sometimes and the glitch that happens to me is it doesn't show the music bar for paused music. Other than that it's easy to use and I just hope it gets fixed,0
No problem with my music list. Everything plays and no problem with loading the songs,1
WHY THE HELL DOES THIS NEW UPDATE KEEP MAKING MY MUSIC PAUSE LIKE EVERY 20 SECONDS. ITS VERY ANNOYING!! I DO NOT PAY PREMIUM EVERY MONTH FOR THIS. PLEASE FIX BUG!!,0
I can listen to some songs in this app!,1
This has many options and search results that satisfies my needs.Good App. Recommend to others.,1
"I enjoy listening to my choice of podcasts, when and where I want. I also like that I can use the app with my phone locked and in my pocket. Very convenient when walking, or at the gym via Bluetooth.",0
The app keeps suggesting songs that I have hidden. The app desperately needs a dislike button available at all times that will then skip the song no matter what playlist you are listening to. The hide song feature is also available only on certain playlists. Lastly to cancell your subscription you need to login on a Web browser then confirm your cancellation what feels like 100 times before it finally believes you don't want it anymore.,0
I have rock with Spotify from day one and they are the only music app that i will ever deal with. They are the best at what they do. I highly recommend Sporify to everybody.,1
This app sucks big time. I got the premium and it was still loaded with ads and commercials. Its not user friendly. Honestly spotify should take their lessons from youtube,0
Great experience no ugly recorded songs here,1
"I use it all the time, paid sub. It would be dope if ppl could comment on your playlist",0
Best algorithm around. I love Spotify. It feels like they can read your mind.,1
Very easy to use and easy to switch over to another device.,0
"Its a great app. Its just that my songs arent playing fully, So please fix this",1
"The only app that gets worse and worse. Lots of bugs, music stops play suddenly, have to restart app.",0
"Great , wish I could download and keep my play list...",1
"Used to love Spotify, but now both me and the hubs are experiencing the same issues posted in recent reviews: pauses and/or stops randomly, fails to display the feature to pause or forward, etc. My hubs is ready to get rid of our subscription, but I'm hoping spotify will read these reviews and get to fixing the issues. I don't want to redo playlists with another app, but we will if this continues.You give refunds or credits? You should because we've been paying full price for half the service.",0
I always look forward to new music releases. Makes me want more,1
One of the best music streaming services. But that is a low bar that they seem to barely pass.,0
The app is fantastic I gave it a four star but it's only playable via direct debit and since I don't have a direct debit card I can't buy the premium time even though I would love to,0
"The playing now bar has disappeared again, and it keeps happening. There's no way yo pause, stop, or skip music without it. This has been an issue for over two months. Fix it spotify.",0
A great platform of music.,1
the suggestion list is worst. And hard to find original songs. It will play worst class remixes everytime you play any playlist. Very disappointed. Would suggest other music app to install. Plus too many ads!,0
"A very good app , recommended to all my friends",1
It will not let me sign up for premium because my street is incorrect. I know what damned street I live on. So does Google maps. Why can't you guys figure it out?,0
Only played rubbish suggested songs on my playlist and I don't even know what the original songs I picked were now even with the setting off! Also gave me adverts after every song! DO NOT GET!!!,0
"This app is the worst. When I click on a song to play, it plays a different song? You need to fix your app or I will fix it for you. They should at least let us skip ads, and let me actually listen to the songs I want to and not want Spotify wants me to listen to?. L Bozo, don't download this app it gave me trust issues because I never saw what was coming next. ðŸ˜",0
This app used to work well everywhere. Now I can't skip anything and I can not even use this on my ps4 without it skipping playback that you miss half a song and there is no playing now bar on my lock screen or in the app.,0
"Has many bugs, completely just closes itself when having another app open and I have premium even though that doesn't cause that issue at all, THIS APP NEEDS A FIX",0
"I installed this a month ago, and really it is so so good for listening music.you can find all the types of songs like instrumental,Punjabi,and etc. Rd Pranunk",1
This is the 3rd time I've given Spotify a 1 star rating. Every other has been deleted. If you like listening to ads this is the app for you. If you like music or podcasts look elsewhere.,0
Sheesh,1
"I am ""guaranteed 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" after listening to 4 advertisements. Two (3 minute) songs later, I get two more advertisements. At least be honest and just tell me that I'm going to get ads every couple of songs.",0
"Spotify was working great until the last update which was yesterday. Ever since that update the app takes so long to load, makes me want to uninstall the app. The app takes forever to load and whenever it does load it doesn't want to play my songs. To fix it, I have to go out of the app and then open it again. That doesn't even work sometimes. I know this comes up a lot under the review section but adds after every song, seriously guys? It's just annoying, that's all.",0
Best for music lovers and podcast listeners,1
Edit: thanks for fixing the problems with latest update. It's been working great on everything,1
I have been using like 4 years sound quality and loading works fairly but the problem is any music playlist I play it repeats 4 to 5 songs reapeatly please repair the bug. And please try to show less ads for the listeners who cannot afford premium account.,0
It is a good app For free music. Though I would like them to improve their UI a bit more.,1
Awesome,1
Glitching. The bar that shows what's playing is disappearing.,0
Very good app. It also automatically generates lyrics even the meanings are not correct.. I appreciate the creator for a good app,1
"Spotify is good to all songs, album, music and playlist",1
It was fine but now it's acting weird. It won't open the image of the song that is playing so there is no way to change to the next song and i have to close the app and restart it so It works,0
"So um idk why but my phone doesn't have the play pause button at the bottom anymore and I really don't like it. Also I Can't open the song I am listening to or see it's lyrics. It also is slow when it's loading the song I searched. I really would appreciate it if you fix all these issues I have stated and also everyone else's issue please . ( try to go threw comments ) Other than that, the app is extremely cool.",0
Paying for duo but the second person cant get anything to play & has to constantly login ....not good enough....do better! Problem now solved. Working well ðŸ‘,0
"Classic case of fixing something that isn't broken, seems like every time I come back to this app there's a new feature that needs turning off because it's too anoying. It has a real problem with the old ""you're not connected to the internet"" chestnut...umm hello yes I am! Every other app is online so why not Spotify? Lots of bugs lately as per other reviewers... Sort it out, I'm paying for this rubbish.",0
Terrible Android Wear support. It is not even on par with a beta user experience on a Samsung Galaxy watch 4,0
Its a nice app but I think you should be able to choose the song. Another thing is that the apps are too long and there's to many. You can fix this by adding skips to adds or less adds.,0
"Overall, Spotify is a great app. But, as someone who has trouble falling asleep and likes to meditate, it would be great if the sleep timer could be set for more than an hour. - Suggesting a 2 and 3 hour option to be included.",0
No method of playing songs from all the followed artists (shuffle artists),0
"Hello, my player disappears when I exit the application and re-enter (I donâ€™t close the application, it remains minimized, and when I re-enter the player sells). Is this some kind of bug? It wasn't like this before",0
"The app is super glitchy. Currently 1 title is showing of a podcast while other music and podcast are playing, while also not showing a time bar at all for the actual music or podcast playing. The app pauses randomly. The app will also randomly exit entirely. Maybe it's time to go back to pandora or something",0
"Ot was good until they started musically profiling me using radio wave brainwave frequency mindhacking devices. Now, all if the lyrics are different than the artist's and it's nerve wracking..",0
I love being able to create my own playlists. I have over 50 in different music genres. Having the commercial-free Premium Package is the best of all!ðŸ‘ðŸ½ðŸ¤©,1
"Love Spotify mobile and have for years. I swear the app runs better than my desktop application most days. Very user friendly, with a large diversity of musicians. This app gets me through the day and is easily the most used thing on my phone.",1
Very good app for listening music full mood refreshment,1
This spotify music app is very good but english song lyrics all correct à®¤à®®à®¿à®´à¯ song all lyrics wrong please change the lyrics...ðŸ˜‡âœŒï¸,0
Bkwas premium,1
"most of the time Spotify will not download media on the first, second,....sixth attempt. music that appears to be downloaded is not. i am not sure what the problem is. it asks for an internet connection even though both dat and wifi are available. frustrating.",0
Internet connection often gets lost when i have full connectivity on other apps. Songs often fail to play. The home screen rarely updates. It takes ages to load albums that i have downloaded and saved locally. I pay $15 a month for all this disappointment along with a very comprehensive music library which is still rad when it chooses to work.,0
Hate the fact that it keeps on playing annoyingly repeating stupid ads that tells you to to go for Spotify premium. Ugh! I should change to another app for listening to music.,0
I can use it for premium kind of account and if you buy the premium pack you will not get the ads and you will enjoy the musicpodcast Keep up the good work spotify,1
I downloaded the ue hyperboom app. The Spotify app doesn't work well with this. I can't see what track is playing. I can't pause. I can't see which track is next. Something got messed up with ue hyperboom connectability. Suuuuuucks,0
Since yesterday the music keeps stopping randomly. Sometimes the music play controls disappear and I have to restart the app so I can bring it back. Please fix the app.,0
"Spotify is one of my favorite apps. Since today though, there are codes visible of the artist instead of normal names. And when I click on a playlist and it shows the name instead of the code, it reverses this occurrence.",0
"If you're terrified of a bald man, who likes to sit down and just have a conversation, this app is not for you. As long as Spotify stands for free speech, I will stand with Spotify.",0
"Second day of glitches. The app has become useless. The player does not appear, I cannot see whats playing, I cannot pause it or skip it. The app closes on its own randomly. The player does not appear on my lockscreen either. What is going on Spotify???",0
"I love spotify, it's made things so much easier and cheaper for me over itunes. But the app has issues. Sometimes it chugs just loading my liked songs. I have them downloaded, it should only really be loading a UI element. After force stopping, clearing cache, and reopening the app, WHY TF am I still staring at a black screen waiting for my liked songs to load god knows when? Shuffle is also fake, I can tell it's only a small loop of songs. Its worse now too, sometimes it'll be like 20 songs now",0
"Hiding a song in release radar doesn't auto skip to the next track. When you skip manually, the app skips 2 songs ahead. Super dumb and annoying.",0
"It's great in my opinion. Cheap monthly bill. Even so, music and podcasts are free. Can't beat that!",1
Loved Spotify but for the last few weeks it's been a buggy mess. Intermittent stops and the control bar vanishing. How are these bugs still going after weeks?,0
Excellent got all the music I like and so much more. Recommended,1
Perfect,1
"Smooth, has what I want and doesn't cost too much. By far my favorite music app. However, it would be nice to join the rest of the world with Hifi quality. I have to pay for Tidal on the side to get the most out of my system.",1
not for listen songs just see advertisentsðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,0
The base is barely useable without premium,0
"I loved Spotify before the update. However, after this update the ratio of ads vs songs is unfair. I spend most of my time listening to commercials rather than my music. Also the chance of getting 30 minutes free has gone way down. Please just fix the amount of ads before and after songs.",0
Last update caused songs to stop playing and I can't listen even if I press play. Please fix this!,0
Hey the ads really sucks man i cant afford premium so dont i have right to get good music expwrience i am not asking you to make spotify ads free but the service is really bad i am listening a song then an ad then another song then again adðŸ¥µðŸ˜­ðŸ˜¡,0
Nice,1
Way too many ads,0
Consistly great. All music quality is too notch and I thoroughly enjoy most of the recommendations the app suggest. 5 stars.,1
Excellent app has every song I've ever searched for.,1
"2022 update: Spotify still hasn't solved it's JRE problem. App works really well most of the time, unfortunately I'm reminded every now and than that Joe Rogan exists on this platform and Spotify is directly contributing to people being misinformed about COVD-19. Sad!",0
"It is such a blissful experience. They have everything, from excellent to worse. Amazing. Stay blessed",1
Stop those ads,0
Most Excellent value for money going round,1
Really good experience,1
My play/pause options have disappeared. This is very annoying! Plus the app starts playing on my phone when I turn the car off. Which I can't stop because I don't have the control bar. Loved the app before this happened.,0
"Ok its a good app and all but THE ADDS man i cant get a good 20 mins qithout 11 adds in a row, i counted and there was 11 adds in a row today, I cant even handle it.",0
"As premium subscriber, It is extremely annoying to get ads on Spotify-produced podcasts such as Whistleblower. Customer service said that ""the ads amidst content structure is a model proven to work for podcast creators"". What a load of bs! This is no Patreon supported creator, neither is the production particularly original. The voice is almost robotic. I'm getting very, very close to cancelling. No offer to make the customer happy, nothing.",0
Works everytime. Has about 99% of the songs I want and I can live without the rest,0
more hip hop of 2022 but into more bass like but her and ari lennox type wit e40 and 808 before 804.,0
"I would like to listen to same artist thatsi choose ,now between each 2 songs another artist becomes in middle",1
"I have listened to quite so recents songs that i have been searching for, was found on Spotify.",1
Incredible,1
Breaking Points is the best show in Spotify.,1
"The app is awesome you also can listen k-pop songs here, you can choose your favorite artist don't think download it ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸ¤©",1
Spotify was great till the app kept crashing CONTINUOUSLY.,0
The best app EVER!! I use it so much and the premium version IS REALLY WORTH IT! 10/10!,1
"I love the suggested music this app generates for me!!! And I'm thrilled that Spotify is not playing Big Brother, giving in to the cancel culture, censorship movent!!! I'm a grownup with a functional brain, so I'm not afraid of being exposed to ""misinformation"" and not being able to use my better judgement! The true test of one's conviction to uphold our constitutional rights... is allowing freedom of speech for view points you don't agree with! Exposure to different ideas strengthens one's own",1
App doesn't open from time to time how do you mess it up after an update please fix,0
Great app honestly but sometimes when you choose a particular song it plays a completely different song and that's quite annoying but otherwise it's great and highly reccomend,1
Can't play specific songs you want to listen to. Shuffle only. In this way strangely restrictive and inferior to the application on PC.,0
"Unfortunately, I'm unable to continue my usage of Spotify while it provides a platform & funding for Joe Rogan to spread vaccine misinformation. Sad because I had just taken the leap to a Spotify Premium subscription a month ago. Also, the app sucks as a user experience if you don't have Premium (which I didn't have for the four years I've had the app).",0
"The variety of song available and the different artists not available on other platforms makes spotify unique but constantly spamming the ads Is not cool anymore, a few is fine but you guys have taken it to an extent at which it is getting too annoying. I am giving 3 stars today but if there is a change in the frequency of ads I will surely change it.",0
I like this app and of course the songs I like it because my fav. songs is also in here but sometimes it not work properly O hope the problem would be fix.,0
Love that I can listen to music with no advert,1
"They removed support for kenwood and pioneer radios so now my music isnt displayed while I'm driving. That is the main reason I bought the radio in the first place. Music will still play but the screen just says ""connecting..."".",0
"Sub par unfortunately. Good when it works, but it is so damn buggy. For what should be a well-oiled established app, it's not. Hopefully they fix it.",0
"What have u done to Spotify in your last update, turn it back into how it was , I am not able to listen to any of my songs",0
"I love this app!! If you have the app installed on the playstation or xbox (it's free just like on google play or apple store) You can hook it up to there, you can log in to you're spotify account and play music louder on a TV screen for like birthday parties for kids, teens or adults, spotify is for everyone! You can also create playlists for certain occasions, if you want to play certain songs in the car, at a birthday party, home, wherever you want! Thank you spotify!",1
"Long time user, we pay for a family premium. Love the app, when it works. It's constantly pausing/stopping mid song, which is super frustrating.",0
"Last update bricked the app for me. No track information, pause skip etc at the bottom and for bonus fun when connected through wifi it seems to pause 2 or 3 times per song for 3 seconds then resume.",0
"ifinity/10 this app helps me to study, sleep, relax, be sad, focus, be happy, love and a lot more I could go on and on. This app was worth it and I recommend this app to you all peeps out there<3",1
"Very nice thought app, but recently lagging a lot. The music currently playing doesn't show, and then stops randomly after a few minutes. Also when I stop the music and reopen the app later, my last played song doesn't show either. On a positive note I find the playlist-making system absolutely wonderful, very practical to be able to add songs to a playlist via all those different methods! So much faster to create playlists like that!",1
The thing I like most about Spotify is the algorithm that suggests new artists and music it thinks you will like based off your preferences. It seems to know your musical taste even better than you do yourself! I use the discover weekly playlist to get new artists and songs based on my musical interests!,0
Thankyou  for bringing it to india,1
I love Spotify the songs are good sound quality and keeps updated with what out currently,1
Spotify provides the music and content I like to listen to when I want to hear it !,1
Love using this podcast,1
Trying to watch a podcast but the video is not working,0
Good spotify apps,1
Great music service,1
Really enjoying this! I even made a radio station. Too fun!,1
WAY to many ads I had to listen 8 ads just to finally get my playlist going and I didn't even get 30 mins of ad free music after that,0
"No major problems, just wish better playlists followed",0
Just love it,1
This is rubbish can't even listen the song u choose this deserve 0 starts,0
"Update, a trial was started without my knowledge, without my consent, and lead me to believe they actually made their unpaid version listenable. Didnt find out until the trial stopped and now getting ads between each song. Despicable practices.",0
"For some reason, when I open Spotify it tells me that I'm offline, when I have wifi and my other apps are working, or if It does work, I don't hear any sound when songs play. please help me fix this!!",0
55 free listening music good sound I love it,1
Useless for offline use you either you have to log in again or all your downloads are gone why pay for the premium features when you cant use them.,0
"Its amazing for song. But can u like maybe not add songs to my Playlist such as "" suggested songs"" it bothers me so much and whenever I try skipping through them I run out cuz that whole Playlist is horrible songs u guys add to it. And don't u dare say "" buy premium"" I'm not doing that cuz wow I don't have money for it. So if this is not fixed I will report this app.",0
"Some great features, but we do need UHD higher sound quality lile Amazon Music has. I thought Spotify was supposed to have it implemented last year.",0
"App is good, only thing I don't care for is some really good music is listed but unavailable. But hey can't get everything you want from one app I guess.",0
I like the way you can save a favorite song and it automatically combines them into one favorites playlist.,1
It's a great app but for God sake Those 6 skips per hour really sucks ðŸ˜• ðŸ˜”â˜¹ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜–,0
I personally have never had any issuesðŸ‘Been a member now 3years loving this appðŸŒŸThank You,1
"Really good for me,am very happy now .all types of songs here.ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜ðŸ˜",1
Wish I could actually listen to the song recommendation rather than 20 similatso GS everytime trying to listen to that one!,0
It's pretty good but the onley thing that bugs me is that you have to pay for the skips and one other thing is that for your own music you can fast forward it but for the rest it's fantastic.,1
Love all the selections. There hasn't been a song I cannot find. Aldo has great selection in podcasts. Would recommend to everyone. I see videos and lyrics as songs play.,1
Its amazing! But not ALL sorts and forms of songs are available mostly the ones with top views are there not more...also stupid ads,0
"App keeps crashing, and i have the premium version",0
I love the Playlist already created and the ability to create my own. The podcasts are wonderful. Thank you for having Christian music and podcasts as part of your options.,1
"I'm going to make this a 1 star if you don't stop doing songs that I ""might"" like. Just because I listen to someone's music does NOT IN ANY WAY mean I that will like someone else's same type of music. I swear I cannot even listen to my liked songs without a 50 minute break of songs that I CANNOT SKIP and am forced to listen to it. Oh I get 30 minutes ad free? Does seem like it because I'm listening to music that I NEVER ADDED that spotify adds. I'm about to just go to pandora if this Dont change",0
It's idiotic that you have to pay to just have unlimited skips or can pick any music. I was listening to my playlist and it just started playing songs that aren't in my playlist and i couldn't select other song. Please remove this and made it actually good.,1
Every possible obscure tune i like is here! Super easy to use! Can't live without my spotifyðŸ˜,0
Connected to wifi. cant search anything,0
Pretty nice for listening to music even without premium (although the limit amount of skips is annoying),1
I can't choose the songs I want to listen to anymore it just does something random now.,0
I dont know why the app is stuck right now. It does not open. Its for the first time since i am using. I have reinstalled it twice but nothing changed. It was ok before but idk what has happened. Plz guide me!!,0
I hate the new update. I cant even listen to music i want. When i clicked play it always play ramdom song. What a dumb update,0
Such a good app but just let me listen to my own music. ðŸŽ§I wish I could pay for premium but geuss what am still a teen with no money. So it's bs,0
this app is so ridiculously stupid as hell it has every song you can imagine but why the hell does it play random songs i didnt even put in my playlist its so stupid and plus theres limited skips and you can only shuffle on moblie???? what the hell its so garbage and stupid it annoys me how this is the only music app other soundcloud which is horrible. i really hate this garbage app that is so half assed,0
"I can't use my spotify, I don't know what happened.",0
"Why this cheap app always showing "" no network connection "" to my liked songs",0
its a good app but somtimes the ads are kind of annoying but its good for the music amazming use,0
"Sessions is completely useless since the qr code was removed. Link only lead to sign up page. Please add back the the qr. As of the latest update: The app doesn't think music is playing when I use a Bluetooth device. I can start music, but the media bar doesn't pop up. And the music randomly cuts off. The only fix is to force close the app.",0
"GREAT RADIO, I MAINLY LISTEN TO OLD TIME RADIO DETECTIVE SHOWS, WOW REALY LOVE IT!!!!",1
"Best. But yet some changes has to be done..like, lyrics is always on the same language in which u are listening song..",0
Js buy premium innit,1
I listened to 2 ads only to get a random song I didn't search for. Thanks.,0
"All is good now. A couple of months of car Bluetooth issues with it, but sorted with recent updates. Love family premium, lots of listening here!",1
Perfect app for music,1
"Everyday us it, so eazy finding my fav.song ..",1
"It's okay so far, but not being able to listen to downloads offline is weird. All in all it's been excellent",1
"Spotify is great however since this new update.....when I get out of the car and turn the car off, my Spotify on the phone instantly turns on and I'm unable to turn the music off. I have to turn the whole phone off!!! Pretty annoying....can you sort it out?",0
"I love Spotify's algorithm. Once it's nailed down your fav genres & artists, you're in for a treat. I get hidden gems every other day. The family premium account is amazing to use. I get to make 30 hour long playlists and download them for offline listening. Best service ever! But when are we gonna get Hi-Fi?",1
"I have to go through a whole playlist just to listen a song,ads are appearing after 2-3 songs and you guys make me watch them twice.I am very disappointed and I've already deleted two accounts of mine just because I thought that your app was going to be just like before,perfect.No ads,and if so,just a few of them and skipping as many songs as I want. You'd better fix your app",0
"Play/pause bar that is at the bottom is gone, can't use the app :(",0
Spotify doesn't disappoint. I depend on Spotify to keep me going at work 10-14 hrs a night. The large collection of choices make it possible to never have to repeat a podcast or music line up BUT Still have the option if I choose to repeat. Thnx Spotify for helping me focus.,1
I refuse to switch services and/or use ANY OTHER MUSIC APP. I love Spotify SO much I low-key recruit people to join the team. We're all winners here. ðŸ’šðŸ–¤,0
"It's an ok app but, it keeps gliching so that I can't choose a song from a playlist and can only click shuffle play. This really bugs me because I can't play songs I want. Please fox this so I can give this app a higher rating!!",0
The Best music streaming,1
I love this app bc it has any types of songs you can listen from here i recommoned to have this app! :D,1
"Suddenly i cant swipe to que songs from me ""liked songs""",1
"Not bad, but price for premium ouch to me",0
"Not good if it needs to be updated constantly. The app crashes and glitches continuously. One update seems to create new bugs. Too much focus on the veneer but not on the basics. On the last update the music played but no player. Lock screen notifications would be there one update, gone the next so I doubt the reliability of it. I also have to quit it every time as it runs in the background when not playing sucking battery. I am a premium member, however it doesn't feel like a quality service.",0
"It was fine, it crashes every once in a while. But I'm mostly upset that they got rid of the preview feature. What was the point in getting rid of that? It made it so much easier to find new songs.",0
very nice,1
Very great list of music and podcast,1
its very good music and you can find all the songs you like or you want and thank you spotify for being a thing its amazing,1
I love this app but can you add more songs and nightcore,1
"A piece of garbage, imagine not being able to view songs in an album, sucks in all ways.",0
So many adds! And distasteful adds. At least 3 or 4nat a time! Can't even skip or replay songs??? What a joke.,0
app broken after last update. the media player notification and the player in app is missing every now and then. the app then closes by itself after some time. only work around is to remove the app from memory and re open. Please fix. Using spotify premium on S22 Ultra SD 8 gen 1,0
"It keeps playing suggested songs, and I have found no way to turn them off. It irritates me a lot and others are having the same problem as well. Other than that, its great",0
"Last update is very unstable, playback keeps stopping every few minutes for no reason :(",0
"I love all the music selections, but I have to give this 1 star. It takes up a ton of space and there are so many adds. I listen to more adds than music.",1
Easy to use especially searching songs in relation to themes. I love the fact that most of the artist I know are accessible.,1
Gud playlists and great song quality,1
Fix the bugs....Since i updated the music still plays even after i exit the app...i have to restart my phone to get the music to stop because the play pause button don't exist anymore.....,0
"Awesome gospel songs. Good selection process of genre, no buffering, just as good as playing the cds directly uninterupted. Great app!!",1
I can listen to any song I want if it it's on a play list and they make listen to suggest ed songs on my yrat playlist,1
"Lame and constraining like YouTube as of late, forcing one to listen to music, not allowing skipping through or directly choosing what to listen to half the time. Gives me the motivation to but CDs or mp3s again and build a collection.",0
Excellent music app ðŸ’•,1
"Solid expirence, high quality music listening.",1
Any song any time anywhere what more could you want,0
"1. You said after free month subscription You will never charge without asking, and you did that, you auto renewed plan without asking and that's ok I continued for 2 more months, then I wanted to cancel it because of upcoming exams, but cancellation process is so difficult",0
Recommended AI on Song Radio is one of the primary reason Spotify Rules !,0
"Sick of it crashing or not finishing a podcast and skipping to the next, uninstalling.",0
"Once you get it figured out, it is easy to use. Doesn't waste data like some other apps making music available to one day and unavailable the next day. I upgraded to the pay service. Expensive but still working good.",1
When I started using this app is was all good night after some time it suddenly stopped showing me the price of the songs. Worst service i got.,0
"To anyone new download every OTHER update. I don't know what the devs are doing but it works great then they update it and it just fails at its only job which is play music. Then the next update will come out and it will work again. The newest update is the bad one and I accidently updated. Now it takes away my play bar, randomly stops playing and I have to force close it to get out to work for another hour then rinse and repeat. I'm one of the few idiots that pay for this app and yet...",0
Very interesting. Easily connect me with my old time music,1
Works great. Only had a couple glitches,0
"Amazing and easy to use app, so good to use. ðŸ’œðŸ‘€",1
Its a great app but.. Since the new update spotify is just noðŸ’€ you cant even play your fav song over and over why did you removed that in the app idk whos idea to put random songs in your playlist who EVER thought of that is a horrible idea,0
"All the music I like... from anywhere, from anytime...",1
best song app just that you have to pay,1
Amazing App..Smooth interface.. great collection,1
Without a doubt the (consistently) least functional app that I work with. Somehow there is an ENTIRELY NEW glitch nearly every time I open the app. Absolutely pitiful on all fronts. Edit: Still absolute trash.,0
Best music & podcast App hands down,0
Works great I even play music off line,1
They tried to make music place for you they try to suggest music for you I hate their suggestions I hate their playlist they have more commercials than Pandora free,0
Absolutely top music app. Definitely the best!,1
"Easy to use. Found almost every song I was looking for. Though wouldn't recommend free service, way too many commercials compared to what it used to be.",0
Best music app ever â£â£â£,1
"After last update not working properly, paying premium for a non working app..not good.",0
"Worst music app ever! I built a playlist and the only option is to shuffle play. Used to be able to select any song i wanted, not anymore. Way better on the pc than mobile.",0
"Good app, but very few good features are free and I'm constantly being pressured into paying high monthly rates for premium",0
I am very mad i am in my playlists and every time a song ends instead of going to the next song it takes me to a random song please tell me how to fix this,0
"They really ought to update their UI. It's super outdated, not a lot of customization options for editing/sorting your playlists, audio quality can vary drastically sometimes. Other than that, the app is alright. It performs well for the most part.",1
Chose Spotify for the minimal user interface it has. Spotify makes syncing so easy across different OSs.,0
My problem with this is that I'm paying for family spotify and I'm still getting commercials on podcasts. I pay to not have my program interrupted by some dumb commercial that I don't care about.,0
"This app is amazing you know , like we can listen to our favourite artist also.ðŸ’œ",1
Easy to navigate way tyriuggt the app,0
"This app has become too buggy and bloated to be reliable. Generally great content and previously invaluable, now more annoying than its worth.",0
"Extremely good quality music which gives justice to every music, whether it be jazz, rock, pop, classic etc and also DJ mixes. Very good correspondence",1
I recommend premium idk if it does it anyways but it takes all the songs you ever listened to the most for that year and puts them in a playlist,1
Love this app. So great that offers a family plan so we can all enjoy the music we love.,1
"Was bad for awhile, Finally reintroduced widget and local file support. Now if we could finally get lossless formats. I can understand bandwidth being an excuse, but now I'm getting tictoks streamed to my phone, so the bandwidth budget must not be an issue, or would it cost them more. I don't see why I can't get FLAC or why that should cost me more, just remove the video and give me better sound.. it's literally the whole point of this app.",0
"Stop removing my reviews Spotify. Your app is bad. Way to many ads, tracks randomly skip after an ad. You can only shuffle albums instead of playing a specific song.",0
You have to pay or else you must suffer the consequences of not hearing your favorite song but hear a Playlist based on the song that is why I dropped my rating but I get it they need money and a lot of people probably abused of this option where ot was pretty much the same than payd for free so ye,0
Not too many original rock but everything else is not bad,1
It's a good app for music to listen to while you are at work,1
"Its really good, but the ads are way too much also there is no translation for all kpop songs ....there are not all idols and singers on it....IMPROVE IT ......ITS IRRITATING",0
Superb sound quality and vast collection.,1
Honestly I never was big into using a music app I mostly downloaded all my music and paid for it but then when I found out you could steal it for free I was super happy but then it was illegal and it made me sad but the fact that Spotify come through clutch s*** boy make you want to slap your mama,0
Love it,1
Always showing no internet connection though it is connected.,0
I love listening to Spotify. They give me a new playlist every week. My favorite music never ends!,1
There is something wrong with this app it keeps on pausing when the song is playing please fix,0
Pretty nice app to use to listen to music or podcasts. The option to share lyrics to snapchat has disappeared. Would like that to come back.,0
I love Spotify and I love the music all kind of music because I love the song called cut it just is very cool and I love the music you have a whole bunch of music and Spotify and Spotify should be sponsored me about 25 should be special to me so I love Spotify and I'm 10 years old and I love listening to music and and I want to be when I grow up I want to be a rapper and then I don't want to be on Spotify and I hope you are see this message so by not see y'all next time,1
Its great does everthing you need to listen to great music,1
"Bit too pricey comparing to what artist gets. UX is poor, very heavyweight app. It's just a music player sic!.",0
Love the stacion they have the best music and is the best spotifymusic love it great job .,1
This is a really good app I use it ever day and recommend new songs that now days I listen to everyday,1
This is the best app for song's,1
I enjoy the recommended music it give me as it expands my library to a whole knew level and premium is really worth it to!,1
The best music streaming services,1
I really love it but could you guys make it to where your playing a song you can still listen to it through your headphones when you turn off your phone,1
Does the touch of my hand work? I can't change the song? An annoying app.,0
I live and breathe Spotify...I listen to it constantly... roughly six hours a day....I also have six female wives...,1
Every song is available on Spotify.. this app is amazing ðŸ¤©ðŸ¥‚,1
This app is good but the major problem is that when I logged in I tried to play my playlist and it was on shuffle I tried to fix it but it didn't work. It is very frustrating that I can't even listen to something I want to in order. PLEASE tell me what to do to get rid of it or fix it or Spotify lost someone for their app.,0
"Nothing works. Works fine on PC and PS4, but not at all on mobile. Not exaggerating, it played 5 back-to-back ads before I closed the app. Can't shuffle anything, can't listen to a single song",0
The app is good and usable even without paying for premium. Edit- the amount of ads I get now feels insane. I'll get 6 or more in a row sometimes and if I watch an ad for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music it barely ever works. It's infuriating,0
Great app for music and podcasts. They value freedom.,1
I absolutly love this app... all my fav songs no ads..!!! Love ittt,1
I love this app! The music is awesome and the sound is great!,1
Why is anyone paying you when your app both on Android and Windows DOES NOT work properly when offline. What is the point of downloading to either if I can't access it when internet is limited or unavailable?,0
Everytime i connect my blutooth headphones and turn on Spotify it automatically disconnectes it . I've tried other apps then my headphones work but whenever i turn this app on they don't work and glitch what kind of an app is this,0
"Very good but, there is an error with downloading and downloaded songs redownloaded everytime I open the app",0
Spotify keeps crashing. No good!!,0
Impressive application. But drops connection to moode player sometimes.,0
Great to listen to favorites when doing housework or walking,1
Awesome ,1
Great music app but it plays music I don't like in my fav songs and idk why I'd play some random song not on list never using again :),0
No ads and so many great tunes - easy to use.,0
This is my only music and podcast app.,0
"Experience is great until you play back your liked songs under shuffle. Over 700 liked songs and it only plays about 40-60 of them and then repeats. Very frustrating to hearthe same song 3 times in 4 hours. I'd I wanted repeats, I'd listen to fm radio LOL",0
It's a good app for the most part. However on the mobile sometimes I get a strange bug where the play bar across the bottom will not appear for days on end... Frustrating.,0
Several music of choice always available and clear network.,1
What is happening! Spotify will randomly start playing a song and then I go to turn it off and it acts like nothing is playing within the app. This has happened twice now. Both times I was in a quiet area and hadn't been playing any music. This bug needs fixed.,0
Well if the commercials didn't come on every 5th song! I'd be better but you play thing Amazon charges extra for.,0
Great app if you like misinformation. Sound quality is noticeably worse than other platforms.,0
It's excelent but if only we could download the songs without paying.....,0
The app is just great I don't get a commercial after every song and this is just my go to app for music ðŸ˜ƒ.,1
"Spotify asking me to give them 5 star rating, personally I think they are equivalent to I-heart, Pandora, and the rest. They are all pretty good.",1
It's not opening. The app isn't opening,0
Too many ads. Not everyone can afford Spotify premium!!,0
Downloaded Spotify after Barcelona deal was confirmed. Now I understand they referred you as agiant company. ImSuperb. Its simply the best ever.,1
Spotify lets you listen to all of your favorite songs and/or podcasts. You can even create your own playlists and listen to music offline.,1
"So far it's been good, I miss the sleep timer my prior app had.",0
The app was great for some time but recently it hasn't been working. If I search for a certain song it plays a totally different song even when I'm listening to playists. I'm not even able to make a song repeat or carry it back. It's getting pretty annoying now so it would be appreciated if you tell me a solution or fix it. Thank you,0
This use to be a great app but there is way too many ads between songs. 1 or 2 is fine for the free version but 6 or 7 is ridiculous. I will be searching for a new music app unfortunately,0
Easy to use,1
App stopped working suddenly with my cars Bluetooth and sometimes with Galaxy buds at my work. It has worked fine in the past but now it stops playing music all the time and buffers halfway through. Also I have a hard time loading downloaded music which the whole point of is to listen to when there's no network. Giving three stars because before the app was very functional.,0
"It's Awesome!!!! I can find the music I grew up on, and then some.",1
"Great Experience ðŸ‘ I enjoy all my best music in one place, any time, anywhere.",1
"Exceptional, so incredible all I wanted to do is listen all night!!!!",1
"I am paying for this app and there is this very basic feature missing. I can't remove my recently played podcast, song from the home page look. Why? Every app on earth has this feature, why can't Spotify? Please suggest how to do it. I don't want everyone to see what i listened last if they ever see my phone.",0
"Horrible, they updated Spotify so you can no longer have your newest songs at the top of the playlist. Meaning every single time you want to hear that playlist it will start with your oldest music. There is NO way to change this on your phone!! Ridiculous and cancelling immediately",0
The gray rooms are amazing Thank u Jason Wilson hoping for more,1
Why the hell you guys show so many advertisment after every song im going to uninstall this app,0
This app is getting worst. Some days ago it was working good but now i can't listen to any song really disappointed,0
It is outstanding app well done,1
Absolutely love having this app especially the premium. However it's frustrating how they don't have a lot of songs,0
Please fix the shuffle function - it's literally been broken for years. I have to uninstall and reinstall often. Please fix this basic function,0
"I would have liked a lot more music and less ads, I would liked to have had more 30 minute non stop sessions. I know I should have gotten the premium subscription but I don't think it's anyone's concern whether or not I pay to listen to my playlists, I was asked for my opinion in regards to the free version and there it is. I'm sure the premium subscription is better than the free one. Isn't it always!!",0
Easy to use and made life enjoyable,1
"The app sucks. I pay for dual membership and it constantly stops on its own for no reason, not connected to anything. The play bar disappears and the only way to pause it is to close the app entirely. It constantly rewinds itself 10 seconds when playing podcasts. And it's not just my phone it's my husband's too. Both are fairly new phones. It's ridiculous to pay for a service as much as we do and they can't even get the app to work properly. And I do have auto updates turned on.",0
"This has been great for years, I've loved having a premium account, the amount I use it, it's worth it. Now however, it won't show me the bar at the bottom with the play/pause, skip buttons and I have tried uninstalling, reinstalling, logging out and logging back in again and nothing has fixed it. Due to this I am unable to control my music with my earbuds or anything and queuing music doesn't work anymore. Please try to fix this bug!",0
"Lots of commercials during podcasts. Not a huge fan. I pay to have Spotify, shouldn't have ads during my listening",0
"This app annoyed me too much, come on!! Ads after every single music?? Why why why??? And I'm not a billionaire to get premium account...",0
The most comprehensive music streaming app with the best mixes of music,1
"Ever since I've gotten the new update, my Spotify has been crashing when I start to play a song. After uninstalling and reinstalling it still didn't work. Resetting my phone also didn't work. Please solve this issue",0
Nice music and lots of choice to suit every occasion,1
always turns itself on or refuses to turn itself off,1
Works horribly. And what about the 30 minute break before ads? That surely isn't the case here,0
Nowadays this app going down grade Continue change the song language irrespective of our choice,0
Everybody knows Spotify Premium is the best app of all apps.,1
Songs added to my favorite list without my permission and not able to play favorites.,0
"The latest upgrade does not allow playback options, ability to control pause,forward skip. .",0
Smooth with highest satisfacciÃ³n,1
Absolutely love my Spotify premium â¤ï¸,1
Please make it possible to select/copy the lyrics so it's easier to translate/print. Thanks anyway for the great listening quality you guys are providing. Cheers,1
Unacceptable. Starts playing randomly on my phone for no reason 20 times a day. I have to delete it and Install again when i want to use it otherwise it just just starts playing anytime,0
Love it. Except they changed the download feature on premium. That is awful now.,0
"Between ""downloads"" not actually being usable offline and then having to re-download the stuff that you weren't able to use in the first place (basically every other day so say goodbye to all your data) the premium version of this needs tons of work. I'm glad I only did the free trial as I wouldn't pay for this jankiness at any point. Do yourselves a favor, get YouTube premium. Downloads that actually work offline, And you don't have to re-download them every other day.",0
The app would not let me play my liked songs instead just random now im mad please help,0
"Fix the shuffle ""always on issue"" I'm a paid member and doesn't even give me an option to unselect shuffle anymore. Frustrating doesn't even describe it.",0
"It was good since i only used it to play music on my ps4 now its completely useless to me since ""Only Premium users can do that"" don't download this app at all, everything is now paywalled",0
Enjoy the variety of music you can listen to,1
I have subscribed to premium and I have paid for 2 months already and still het adds and can't listen to music off line,0
"I took the premium and looks like it's the best thing to do but it's a bit costly for just listening to music. Also the recommendation of Spotify is so good so far , it's even better than apple music which is actually great. However there should be a option to download only one song instead of downloading whole playlists.",1
Love this app! I am always able to find music thst I loved growing up and that I love now to add to my Playlists!!,1
"Normally ok then for no apparent reason Spotify moves all my data from my SD card to my internal storage? Had the issues ""fixed"" several times. Still continues to be a problem. Switching to Tidal.",0
App is way too good like all songs are available here but they give way too many ads like after one song there are 2-3 ads . No we cant afford to take premium subscription but there are too much ads because of this users get irritate.,0
Stopped paying for the app due to the stopping in the middle of a song or podcast. This has been an issue for quite some time and no fix has been provided. App is not worth paying for until its resolved.,0
Ouu i love spotify! I really enjoy the fact that it suggests a lot of other genres similar to the songs I'm already listening to and I discover much more music with this app!,1
I can't turn off shuffle I don't have the icon,0
Hi thanks my enjoying times o.k. function great my system I use stops two day after heat resistance? Cool,1
"The shuffle feature doesn't shuffle very well and tends to play the same songs every time I shuffle a playlist. Other than that, it's a great app! I love the recommendations!",0
It's just an awesome app.it has everything i would want in an app. Keep up the good work!!,1
My favorite app for all that is music and sound They have it all 1010,1
Great app for listening to music I like the app very much if anyone wants to listen to music just download Spotify,1
"Downloaded it agian to hear a local bands music, click play on there stuff, it plays so other bands music. Overrated app they need to sell it to Elon Musk.",0
"I love this app,i think i have seen a music app like this",1
Enjoyed every selection of music,1
In this aap many types of song any language and we are listings all song,0
i hate shuffle i can't start my playlist mygosh please remove the shuffle button i don't have a money for the premium!,0
"All of my library at one place, on the go, online or offline.",0
"Not bad, pity Spotify could not sort out their shuffle play as it plays the same songs not the whole playlist ... bit sad really.",0
Highly recommend Spotify it seems better than YT to me,1
it's a good app but I think thirs a bug cuz wen I play my favorite song it well play another song so 1 star,0
"Spotify slowly turning into yet another leftist propaganda echo chamber. Remember, it's only misinformation if it doesn't fit with the leftist narrative... well at least until enough people realize it's true then the left can pretend it was their idea like everything else they've been wrong about up to this point. Go woke, go broke. They'll figure it out eventually.",0
Plays songs that aren't even on the the liked song playlist and just litters it with songs from genre you don't even like listening. Good luck listening to something like metal because you'll get forced to listening to love songs for lonely people.,0
"Nice music App really, Would have given 5 stars but I could not subscribe to a premium service. Even with a Mastercard Debit card. It's really frustrating. Fix it and get 5 stars",0
Amazing app for listen music but still too much ads,0
"Im deleting this app because Spotify is assisting the spread of misinformation and disingenuous propaganda. I won't miss it though. Used to like this service but the quality has diminished. Ads are every other track, and the music often skips or cuts out after 10 seconds.",0
Unable to see playback controls or playlist. Does not find Chromecast unlike other apps.,0
The sound is good. The songs are in a variety from old classics to new contemporary songs,1
"App on Android had been getting slower and slower. Takes ages to do anything, no other apps have this issue. Currently horrible user experience. No issue on other OSes.",0
Allows the spread of misinformation. I guess it is really just another entertainment platform like Fox News,0
Its good but it when i checked the playlist one day it changed like you couldnt see the songs anymore,0
I enjoy it good music beautiful artist and nice sound effects no interruption the app is just awesome.,1
"This app really deserves a 5 star from me, its one of the best music apps ever no problems at all. This app os the best highly recommend it.",1
Best music app out there ðŸ‘,1
"I absolutely love it, the playlists completely suit my taste, my sister had it and we would always use it to play taylor swift when ever we went driving, I had no idea it was free! It was too good to be true but it was.",1
"App is absolutely unusable as of the latest update, anytime you leave the app it will completely remove your music bar while still playing, I have to close the app every single time. Love spotify but this absolutely unacceptable for a company worth billions. Will update If they fix this.",0
"legend has it this is the best streaming app, but i think the legend kinda lied ðŸ’€",0
so hard to play specific song..look like this app fooling me around...time to uninstall..,0
"I use Spotify Premium, and it's great value for money. Spotify has a diverse range of curated playlists, making it easy for you to find the musical genres that you enjoy. It's also clever enough to make playlists designed just for you, based on what you typically listen to. It has never been easier for me to discover new artists and songs that I love!",1
"Sometimes it makes me think this is the worst UI with buggy music app, I've been a premium member for almost an year still this thing won't load interface or songs properly most of the times",0
It's good music service the only issue I have is the premium adds I don't mind having regular adds or not having more skips but the constant shoving in your face adds for premium are bad,0
These days sotify is showing kannada song and playing telegu songs. That's all the error in this app. Or else it is a very good app for songs. Thank you.,1
Best music listening app 10000000/10,1
"Brilliant music, able to choose what I want.",1
"Music stops randomly. Sometimes when I go into the app it does not display the music currently playing, making it impossible to pause the music.",0
Ok not bad,1
Nice app I use this every day ðŸ’œ no ads no bufferings..... âœ¨ songs in all languages are available ðŸ¤˜ I love this app so muchðŸ’™âœ¨,1
Good Music Sound Quality,1
Good,1
"Disappointing. I legitimately tried Spotify; even paid for premium to have the full experience, but honestly I can't justify how poor this experience is. To be fair, music is ok (nothing special beyond other services), but for podcasting... This thing is BAD in the most basic ways. It's inconsistent in remembering where I left off, not to mention whether I've heard an episode or not ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ plainly, it fails to meet baseline features â€” I'm honestly surprised they're as popular as they are.",0
30 minutes of ads for 3 minutes of music :(,0
"Horrible, always crashes and stops playing",0
"Had a few weeks of not being able to pay for subscription, thought I'd just use free service until I got paid - Spotify insists you cancel your subscription to use the free service. So I did, and found that now the free service will only let you play albums randomly. So I uninstalled Spotify and have now signed up to Apple music. Way to drive me away, goons.",0
This app remembers that music I like and makes playlists from it and changes it frequently...love that,1
"I couldn't sign in or log in at all!!!!. But, Spotify is a good app, ( I am probably biased) I listen to it in my other devices but i can't in this device. Other than this problem, I would probably rate it a 5.",0
Musica is my go to drug... And the podcasts are nice too!,1
"Fits to my needs, my mood, with my song preference... Without any advertising",1
Your app is filled with bots ruining my family's and friends public playlists. I want to report the bot accounts but your verification email doesn't work either. What happend to spotify? Get your act together!!!,0
It always crashes everytime I try to launch it,0
"Ok so first of all it's okay i don't really like the new up date , 2 you can only skip a few times , 3 I can't click wich song to play , 4 too many ads and i can't skip them like wth i don't care about it , 5 sometimes it's lagging , 6 it's not playing some of the songs i have in my library , please switch back to the old version where i can actually skip more than a few times and i can actually click what song to play , although it's not that bad",0
Am stranger for this spotify but i want to try either perfect or strong,1
"After spotify installed, I stopped using YouTube for music ðŸ˜. Please add feature like *requesting song to Add in spotify collection. There are lot of small music artist who produced amazing songs and musics. Example: speaker of the house-your galaxy(feat. GoldAN).",1
The service is great Pricing is not bad either,1
"Ugh. I pay for a premium family plan and the stream just keeps cutting out. And then on the miracle that my Playlist does play, I disconnect my Bluetooth and it continues playing on my phone until I force close the app. Please fix your issues. Also, get rid of Rogan.",0
Feeling nostalgic after hearing songs I haven't heard in years. Easy to find a d great quality,1
"Pretty disappointing that the app lacks the ability for users to select multiple tracks at a time for the purpose of creating and customising our library and queue... Would love to see this in the future. Other than that, awesome!",0
Why can't I play Money by: Lisa? & Why is it replaced with unauthorized song?? It's been days yet you do nothing about the issue. This app sucks ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,0
"Spotify the more more collection in tamil. And install Spotify premium ad-free , higher quality song play with lyrics for highest song's. This app more mind relaxation ðŸ˜Œ.",0
Ads are quite annoying but everything else is good,1
Way too much ads. Literally after every 2 songs there are ads. Now I have started listening in YouTube. Uninatalled.,0
"WONDERFUL MUSIC QUALITY AND JUST AMAZING SERVICE SOMETIMES CAN BE A BIT SLOW BUT ITS USUALLY PRETTY FAST YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY DOWNLOAD SPOTIFY ITS WONDERFUL AND THE CRAZY THING IS, IS THAT THERE ARE NO ADS",1
"This app used to be fantastic, but after these last two updates it's gotten super buggy. I would wait until it's fixed to bother with it, honestly.",0
"Adds random songs, doesn't play my play list, hides songs, adds every 4 songs, ads all the time, not just 30 minutes",0
Free music >>> Spotify ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ full of ads ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“â˜•,0
love,1
As @ Jan 2022 full 5 stars. Really good platform for a tech dinosaur like me. Just upgraded download settings and sound quality IS better (watch mobile data usage though). Grown to love it. Only reason not 5 stars is that periodically I have to reinstall to make work in the background on my phone. Otherwise it's really good. Update Feb '21 gone back to a Galaxy S from am A. Much better! Now given 5 stars as much more stable.,1
I've been having lots of issues lately like I can't hear the songs I want to add to my Playlist or even it won't load or will keep playing but stop I really hope you fix this soon,0
"The new update is a mess, shuts off, disappearing play button, disconnect from bluetooth headphones, it will play when you shutdown the app. You have restart phone to stop the playing, I am also using Samsung 22 ultra. Please fix these issues or I will go back to Amazon music for streaming.",0
Make the ads a little shorter and its all good,0
"Great, I can easily listen to podcast audio without the interference of a video while doing other things.",1
"I love it but if u need to fast forward,more than the stipulated,it wn't allow",0
"Excellent service, much better than the competition, Google music, Amazon, Etc.",1
Great range of music,1
Good so far. Need a couple of tweaks. But its ok,1
"Removing previews for playlist creation, will be the sole reason I remove my subscription. This app has gone downhill fast and hard.",0
"I get 2 minutes worth of ads after around 2 maybe 3 songs, hell even after one, please cut down the ads so I don't have to go to pandora",0
I have to force quit this app constantly while using it.,0
"For some of the less fortunate ppl using this app there's so many ads and unfortunately I can't bring myself to waste almost $10 a month on this app it works well when it wants to, I get frustrated when I'm trying to listen to music and all I get is ads and maybe 2 songs after then more Ads. Get rid of the ads, ( I know that won't happen). ðŸ™„ðŸ˜ ",0
"Basically a convenience factor why I still lose and pay for premium. App is horrible, restarts podcasts, freezes podcast. Will say I have no internet connection when I do. When it works it works great. But it's getting harder to look past the pitfalls.",0
"I enjoy the music. It's my first time to use it, I am loving it already. I have my playlists, of songs I love, following each other without interruption ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„",1
"I love this app; I get so much music even without premium. But then again I only listen to like ten songs lol. All in all, in my personal tastes, this app is number one. Definitely better than Pandora",1
Love music & podcasts.,1
The app likes to randomly stop and close when using. It would be great otherwise. 2 stats since it constantly closes on me everyday throughout the day.,1
So good and enjoying to hear music,1
The playlists and recommendations are superb. If they only had a 10 start review!,1
I like the app but i can still get all the same music on youtube or mp3juice.cc for free,0
PERFECT,1
"Encountered a technical issue with the app, online support refused to help and disconnected multiple times in the middle of diacussion. Even suggested I delete my account and create a new one to affect application functionality.",0
"They say ads every 15mins, what they dont say is its every 2 songs and ads run about 1.5mins to 2mins which is just ridiculous. Dont believe me, Spotify? Look at my user log using my email address, thats illegal... uninstalling now. I gave yiu money for 3 months and as soon as i deactivate, you bombard me with nuances? Unethical. #done #goingbacktoyoutube",0
the app is all good but there's this tiny little problem. i can't see covers of playlists after opening them. i can't see the cover pictures of artists either. i don't know if it's my phone or internet or the app. please fix if it's the app.,0
Ok to appoint but the fact that you have to have premium to not have ads it's kind of a annoying but all that aside amazing 10 out of 10,1
Glitchiest POS app i have on my phone but great music selection.,1
The music is amazing it's just the singers don't get much money but the system is amazing,1
"Spotify App is tooo good , also what kind of song you want listen they'll get in Spotify App. Thank you so much for uploading such a good song like old Tibetan song. You make me feel so happy to hear my favourite and memorable song that i enjoyed with friends.",1
"Overall, just a buggy app, not overly compatible with listening devices like Alexa. Was paying premium for a little while but stopped. As I don't want to support a platform deplatforming and silencing free speech. Free version is just garbage too. Commercials nearly every two songs just isn't pleasant.",0
Lots of music and podcasts to discover. Easy to share.,1
Only issue is that there is way to many ad breaks,0
"No problems , great app",1
Spotify is a crook I'm being charged twice a month for my premium account ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ,0
Songs ok but lyrics worst then expected.totally lost of read,0
Obnoxious popup about needing Bluetooth every time I open the app.,0
"I search and find my favourite songs easily,so as I walk..I sing.its an interesting app",1
"The mobile version is absolute thrash I can't even choose the song to play, i can only choose a playlist with full of songs that i don't like.",0
Thank you for the freedom to listen to what ever I want!!! Love Spotify,1
"About half the time the mobile app just doesn't respond and the other half it's slow. My other apps are working fine. The rest of my family, all with different phones, are having the exact same problem. Maybe Spotify could invest more in making their app work? Instead, they paid 100 million to Joe Rogan, who is spreading medical misinformation in the middle of a disastrous pandemic.",0
Overall its a pretty great experience for music streaming only wish it had more niche content,1
Spotify is my favourite and most likely ðŸ˜Œ in my home it would have to pay more more than I have been paid ðŸ™ƒ for the first time in my life I have been trying to find out if my self or not salama po,0
"I really enjoy it, it's easy to use and i can listen to my favourites songs wherever i want",1
So I was using Spotify for the last two years and now am having some issues. Whenever I get a message notification from WhatsApp then notification beep sound continues. No matter what I try the beep sound continues. I don't know whether it's happening because my phone have some bugs or Spotify having some issues. Need an explanation if it's possible.,0
Unable to sign-in to the app since the past 2 days. The login page itself isn't working and trying to login without password through email link is not working either. Tried resetting the password through their webpage but that doesn't work either. What's the point of buying a subscription if you can't even access the app.,0
"Am I the only one having poor audio quality on Spotify. I have tried loud, and chosen the highest audio quality too",0
It's great to think of a song and then immediately add it to your library or hear it! Has had almost every song I've searched for. Strangely no Garth Brooks tho (but several clones).,1
You scewed this app up entirely with the last update I have had a subscription to this app for years but the last update is TERRIBLE!!!I can't tell what song is playing and I have to go the whole way back to the playlist to change the song taking away the bar to tap on and it bring up the song playing was a horrible idea and it has made using this app a hassle if it is not changed I will be canceling my subscription its beyond infuriating not be able to just click and bring up what's playing,0
"No sound when i cast music to my Android TV (or ask my google assistant to play some song in TV). Its playing the song. But no sound is there. Tested on different wifis, checked TV volume settings, app is updated to latest .. All other muisc apps just work fine (able to cast from my phone to TV. Also i am able to play songs in TV via voice assistant) with amazing sound clarity. Spoity plays something but unfortunately muted. So something definitely wrong with the app i guess.",0
After the new update my music bar doesn't show up at the bottom of my phone screen and I also have no controls in my top screen pull down menu. I'm on a pixel 6 pro.,0
Love the freedom of having any music I want any time I love Spotify thank you,1
Works well. Ads can be annoying. But otherwise nice.,1
Good app but they should let us download songs for free and the ads are irritating me Spotify don't think me wrong stop ads !!!!!!!!!,0
Amazing listening app Music pod casts books and more,1
"Worst, its full of ads",0
"The app is amazing, except for one thing. When I make a Playlist, it adds random songs to it. There's no setting to turn this off either. If I want a Playlist containing songs I like, I don't want random songs I may find inappropriate added to the Playlist. Don't tell me to get premium either, it's absurd to force extra content onto someone. Premium should be to add content, not removing forced content. Other than that, I guess it's ok...",1
Same problem as what a lot of recent reviews have mentioned. The latest update made the all stutter and the play bar disappears making it impossible to use. Can they not just leave it working?,0
wish they added the search bar on playlists for androids ðŸ˜£ desktop spotify is still best update: they did it!!,1
So I have a subscription and up until about two months ago I've been having serious issues with Spotify losing connection even though I have full bars. Got a brand new phone problems even worse. Must be Spotify. Please get this fixed.,0
"Great music, app sucks. Closes all the time. Makes you start podcast from the beginning. Freezes up often. Super liberal as well, so some things you search for aren't available.",0
I am very impressed that when many of us requested the play selection feature be reinstated it actually was. I would provide a five-star rating but no one is perfect.,0
Well after one month it makes all your music shuffle play without telling you but overall it's a good app,1
I hate this app because of this app doesn't bring your song which you type to listen ðŸ’”ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡,0
It is a great app for listening music but I have a suggestion that you should provide english translation of songs of other language .,1
"Lately, unfortunately very poor experience as my podcasts' playlists are not being updated. I would listen to an episode already a week ago, and yet the app still shows me that this episode was uploaded yesterday...",0
The app keeps glitching. Music will suddenly stop playing or the queue completely disappears so i have to restart the app everytime. Sometimed restarting it doesn't fix the issue :/,0
"Good app, but I can't log in it keeps saying no Internet connection but I do have good Internet sucks because I just paid my monthly subscription",0
"Love Spotify,has all my favorite music at the tap of my finger tips.ðŸ‘",1
Absolutely love Spotify! Well worth the premium ðŸ‘Œ,1
Keeps shutting off if my phone screen is unactive after the latest update,0
I enjoy Spotify. It's a fair platform that supports free speech. This is important to hear podcasts from all walks of life. I am human.,1
Glitchy. Off when screen off. No play button,0
Great app for the entire family!,1
It's pretty cool with the new enhance feature but you really gotta work on the suggestions. I remove the same recommended songs and it keeps putting them back on there. It's annoying,0
"Awesome only issue I've had is that some times the audio stays muted after I use the hey Spotify feature, like when driving, so I say hey Spotify again and then don't say anything after , then it unmutes.",0
Nice ðŸ™‚ app for listening songs,1
"Enjoy every bit of this app, easy to use, and great categories to choose from,",1
Love it for pod cast!! And not very many adds for it to be free which is always the great!,1
"App keeps showing ""not connected to internet"" eventhough when I'm connected to WIFI. It works fine with mobile data. I have tried reinstalling the app but the problem still persists. Its very very difficult to use this app if this keep showing. Please solve the issue ASAP",0
worst app logging out by itself not opening properly the ui feels like it is not properly designed,0
Very good music app,1
Would be a good app if they didn't sensor / delay independent artists. There are better options out there that you can have music available as soon as it is released.,0
great,1
"Whenever I make a playlist, that means I want to listen to the songs I put there. Not random songs that Spotify give me and don't even let me skip",1
Good variety of shows.,1
"How nice to get music on the go, plus it doesn't get interpreted driving through tunnel or spotty network place",1
It keeps playing suggested songs even when i turned it off this app is so bad,0
loveitt,1
The app wont let me choose the songs I want to listen to without having to pay extra fees. Doesn't play music when I exit my phone. When I choose not to watch an ad for free ad time it still plays an ad. Will skip the your song in the middle to play an ad.,0
Tha best ,1
Keeps skipping even with full 5G service. Pandora plays straight through on same signal with no problem so I know it's this app.,0
"I like using the app, but I use other music streaming apps when my account is down. Earlier in the year I lost my account and got it back realizing that all that all the playlists' I made along with the friends who would add to the playlists' got deleted or I have to search for my old account. Hopefully I find it soon.",0
Excellent,1
Spending experience with Spotify Highly recommendable,1
It would be good if there was more skips and no shuffle its annoying and there is too much ads,0

"What is happening with spotify? How about you let us know why the app won't play on Bluetooth, can't pause songs, displays incorrect to what is currently playing. Why is there no update to fix this?",0
"The apps sound quality is very nice and I appreciate it but sometimes the songs stop playing and I have to play it again and again, the ads are the most important part like I know that I don't have a premium pack but it does not mean that there will be ad after every song and not one but two aur three, that's very annoying and irritating. Please fix it ðŸ™",0
"I used to like Spotify but the shuffle mode I don't like and I used to have it repeat but now I can't, I like the older version so I'll give it a 2 star",0
"Love it! â¤ i can find all of my music, podcasts, meditations in one place.",1
unable to sign up or login.,0
Why does the app likes to crash every time I listen to music? It's very annoying.,0
I love ðŸ’ž Spotify. So far it is the only music app i have found that works great on my device(s). I have NEVER had any issues w using Spotify. Great App. Id recommend highly to anyone. ðŸ˜,1
Soo great app but one problem it's the fact that when we add new songs to playlist there is a recommend section when we wanna know how the song sounds like you can just hear to a little part of the song i don't know if is just for me.but it ain't working it was a great feature please.just please bring it back,1
Not so good. Unable to log in even if i m a premium member. Also not able to download music. Premium services are not available but debiting my account without giving me services every month,0
"I am a premium account holder, and a song that i play regularly, Money by Lisa was hacked easily and her streams were stolen. Issue was reoorted for days but no response from spotify yet. Disappointing!!!!!",0
"The ability to not play music on demand is incredibly horrible, and not being able to rewind or skip to certain moments in a song also makes the app extremely inconvenient to use",0
I find it so satisfing that i can find any song that comes to my mind on this app also i am loving the podcast aspect,1
"They dropped connect support for a ton of car decks. No announcement, just dropped to try and sell their car thing. Been a long time plan subscriber but will now be saving myself 215$ a year. Already end up with several other music services through other memberships. The one that set spotify apart was being able to control it through my car deck. Listen to new music and favorite it while driving. Now I would have to operate my phone While driving so no.",0
It keeps stopping and too much adds,0
1 song and 3 ads go premium if u really want to listen music,0
"Hey spotify! Fix your app! I have to restart it every other time I use it for it to work correctly. Unacceptable, especially since I am paying for it.",0
Smart music app Excellent,1
I think the music options are the best!,1
"Great app! Haven't run across any ads. The song selections are phenomenal! Best part, I can listen to Distractible! Download now, it's free!",1
Bro I can't get premium so I can't choose the song I want. I hate this app,0
"Very easy to use... I'm not subscribed on payment, but many friends share their Playlists with me.. enjoying the podcasts too.",1
Awesooome!!! Always my FAVE... all then other apps be playing for second bro.. yall are doing an amazing job bless up good job ðŸ‘,1
Wonderful,1
What is happing with the app? Work well for the last 2 years but lately is stopping too often. And this is very annoying. Why? I am using the premium but even on Android and Apple iPhone the issue is the same.,0
Love the algorithm that streamlines similar songs to play,1
What is with this update- I also suffered the same thing everyone went through here. What-,0
It be nice if once you dislike a song it would stop playing it in the future. Spotify is also removing songs of artists that have opposing views to their agenda.,0
"Just want to add my hat to the pool of people talking about the loading issues. Recently cant get the bottom bar to show up and the podcast pages dont load. This makes it impossible to skip ahead or set a sleep timer, kind of sucks as a premium subscriber that I have to use other apps to get certain features. *Galaxy S20 ultra 5G with current updates*",0
I LOVE SPOTIFY I LOVE ALL THE MUSIC ON SPOTIFY THE MUSIC ON SPOTIFY FOR THOSE OF THAT DON'T HAVE SPOTIFY I SUGGEST TO ALL OF YOU TO INSTALL SPOTIFY FOR THOSE OF THAT CAN INSTALL SPOTIFY AND FOR THOSE OF THAT DON'T HAVE SPOTIFY GO TO YOUR GOOGLE PLAY STORE AND THEN GO THE SEARCH BAR BAR UP THE TOP OF GOOGLE PLAY STORE AND TYPE IN SPOTIFY BECAUSE I SUGGEST TO ALL OF YOU THAT SPOTIFY IS REALLY AWESOME SPOTIFY IS REALLY COOL SO FOR THOSE OF THAT DON'T HAVE SPOTIFY ALL OF YOU PLEASE DOWNLOAD SPOTIFY,1
No words to tell about this app I love this app so much,0
"""SEE UPDATE"" Thank you for fixing this application it is better than the previous 3 updates. It is back working near on perfectly. Great looking UI, nice, clean,, easy to navigate with probably the most extensive library of music from any provider. *UPDATE* downgraded to 1 star from 5 as album art is missing from all of the downloaded albums. *UPDATE* cleared cache and uninstalled and installed fresh and everything appears to be working okay again, fingers crossed that it retains the album art.",1
Android user - this app is terrible unresponsive most of time. Track playing not showing down bottom so can skip etc ...pointless to pay for premium where this is the interface. Fix now,0
So far I am loving it because it has alot more options then Pandora does. It's alot more easier to use then Pandora. And I think it doesn't buffer as much as Pandora.,0
"Spotify used to be better, now it's just glitchy with one thing or another. I'm constantly needing to restart the app because it won't display the info bar of what's playing, which itself contains the play/pause command. I know it's not a big deal but when I'm browsing through music I cannot bring up the title or song info to a whole screen and when I have to close and open the app it resets itself and I completely lose the song. I'm only still using it because I don't know of another music app",0
I wish I never updated it because now it pauses randomly and the song bar doesn't show up so I have to restart the app. It's really frustrating and I hope it gets fixed asap.,0
"Tf is wrong with this app all of a sudden. Songs play in the background, no control?!",0
It is nice to not have ads. I just don't see a way to flag something you don't like.,0
Bruh why can't I add songs to queue from the search ?? Now i can't even add it to playlist without having to play it first and loose my queue tf?????,0
The Joe Rogan Experience is my favorite Podcast on Spotify. Love the fact that Spotify doesn't play the part of speech nazis and as long as this continues they will have my support. People should be able to speak freely on their podcast. Point blank.,1
It started happenekg recently: The app doesn't plays the song u select. It plays some completely different song. Also the equaliser switches off automatically after the advertisement. You need to again go in the setings and activate it back.,0
"App crashing on playing a song. Force stopped the app, Restarted device , uninstalled and installed again but nothing stopping it from the crash. Please fix this ASAP",0
I would've given full 5 stars if you made songs downloadable.,1
"I need podcasts in Ukraine, but they are still not available... Shame!",0
I dint expect that this app can cover all my regional songs wow it's an amazing music app it covers everything I just loved it ..you won my heart â¤,1
Probably a favorite of many today 2022 the music and artists are easy to find and the selection and prices are reasonable,1
"Cant watch video, can't skip, cant use settings, suck ðŸ‘",0
12 ads in a damn row. This shouldn't be able to happen,0
"I love Spotify, if you love music you will love Spotify",1
"I think this a great app but there is a minor inconvenence, when I'm listening to a song midway (on a playlist) it stops, plays two ads and goes to another song. It would be great if this didn't happen so often.",0
"I really do love using Spotify and have rated 5 â˜† purely because they have an amazing range of music, podcasts and short stories in a huge rage of genres. The only criticism is that Â£10 a month is expensive for the likes of us who don't have a lot of cash to spare however they do offer a free service so hence the 5â˜† review ðŸ˜‰",1
"The absolute best music platform ever. If you have Spotify, you have everything. Love you.",1
It's a great app and I love it because there are also lyrics to all of the songs,1
Enjoy music while browsing are so exciting,1
Makes me fall in love with music again!,1
"What l absolutely like about Spotify is l can listen to a fantastic array of music with out trying to find my cd collection and then I find out some of them won't play l it's convenient and it sounds awesome through my sound system,l would like to thank you whoever you are that created this site I'm wrapped ðŸ˜ƒ",1
why I can't play the song? I install and uninstall for many times but it always close when I play a song. Pls fix this spotify :(,1
Good music but I can't stream music through data so only downloaded music while on the road :(( didn't have that the past couple years,0
"Okay, here only because of the JRE. Had the free trial a while, while paying for YouTube, so i just switched and i was hoping all the bugs would leave with the paid subscription. They didn't. Constantly pausing it self. Constantly closing it self. Losing where i am in the pod cast. Constantly skipping mid podcast losing my spot. A few of the episodes seem to be tampered with or ment to be frustrating to play. Was trying to play episode 1555 with Alex Jones.Took me a half hour to work",0
every damn time I try to get my premium I get unable to connect error AFTER I finished loading the damn page. this doesn't happen when using normal browser. your app is trash yo.,0
Best music app I have used the best thing is you can down load podcasts to listen offline. I recommend listening to scared to death,0
Clear audio experience that doesn't use a lot of my battery! Love it!,0
Love this app it's recommendeds me the type of music I like to listen to when I listen to specific songs.,1
a very good app for using lovers. recently there is a repat issue of.music stopping in between songs. it is very annoying. not yet resolved,0
It's very good I like the music and their no ads,1
Would love to give 5 stars.... But I would love that the ad frequency be reduced as it's like too annoying since we get 2 consequtive ads every 2 songs..... I am a premium member of Spotify and it feels how amazing it is to be ad free but just coming back to the Spotify free witnessed a huge sike in my anger lol,0
"Ever since the last update a few days ago my app has not been loading properly. It takes forever to load lists and start tracks, sometimes pausing for a full minute before playing or loading. I utilize a Google pixel I've turned my phone off and on multiple time, reset wifi and different wifi networks, uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Now the login screen won't even load to let me login. I hope a patch is rolled out soon because since the last update the app officially has become unusable â˜¹ï¸",0
"Good, although whats with the downloaded playlists not working when youre offline, so whats the point in downloading them??",1
loop and shuffle dont work,0
"Pretty good app...the only problem is ads...ohhh the terrible ads...90% of them are trashing at us for not upgrading to premium...as a free app i know they have to make money but, this is just too much...they say watch this short video to get 30 mins of uninterupted listening...short video as if! total of 3 min ads...very short ad indeed! Plus not 30 mins more like 10 mins of listening. Music stops randomly for no reason and we need to go back and press play again...overall 3.5 stars for me....",0
"Awesome app, Someting I love is the opciÃ³n to listen the local music.",1
3 adds per 2 songs. Which means officially there are more adds than songs on this app,1
LOVERS,1
It only plays one part of the songs on my liked list and it says watch this video to get 30 min of uninterrupted listing but then they make me listen to another ad,0
I listen to music all day every day and this gets the job done with an easy to use UI and sharing with friends.,1
Newest Update is Awful - App reset and closes when changing songs.,0
Nice with excellent music/I like the sound of the music,1
Overall it's good but I have a major problem. The song keeps pausing in the between it's just sooo annoying!!,0
Really enjoying the app so many albums I haven't heard in years,1
I can't play the samples of songs to add to Playlist.,0
I can find all the music i like. Especially all the old stuff that is hard to find on other apps!,1
"It works great 99 percent of the time, but it keeps moving my downloads back to internal storage when I set it up to download to the SD card. When I change the storage location back to the SD card, it transfers all the songs and then crashes and I have to uninstall/reinstall it. I don't know why this keeps happening, please fix it.",0
"It's a good app but I hate the fact that it only lets you select the songs if you're a premium, it tends to get kind of annoying honestly, but besides that, the app works well and I like the fact that it lets you listen to the music when you're outside of the app and if your screen is off.",1
"The user interface needs work. Why is it so hard to find what I have or what I want. YouTube Music is much easier to navigate. Apart from that, not willing to fund Harry and Meghan, who have produced nothing. So I've cancelled my membership and removed the app.",0
Good for English music abroad,1
"I love Spotify, it's one of the best music app that have all of the songs,but one thing I like to say is that I don't know how to download music from the app so please try to get this done .",0
"The best music app EVER, I got everything I need in just one app",1
Great music available all the time.,1
y'all need to make it cheaper,0
"Would say Spotify is up there in the top five apps of all time,she is kind caring and super cool I love her ðŸ˜Š",1
Spotify all the way guys it's so useful. So much better than other music apps. Premium is totally worth it too.,1
It's the best music app so far.,1
"Any music is there , but after downloading music to listen offline at some point like after a day , it doesn't play it",0
Easy to use for old not to tech savy guy lotd of great features,1
1 star for this app because I just wanna PLAY MY FAVORITE SONG IT JUST PLAYS ANOTHER AD Fix it and I'll put it into 5 stars and it's so annoying,0
App not running on wifi.,0
"Regularly stops playing, skips tracks, lags during songs that have been downloaded. Very buggy",0
"I can't log into my account? My connection is fine and I'm using the correct email and/or username and password, but it still won't log me in. I have also tried the log in without password and got the link on the email I put but it says its expired even though it hasn't been even 3 mins yet??? Please fix this.",0
Spotify was good. Updated and it wants to keep stopping tracks all the time randomly. Pretty damn frustrating when your paying for premium and it seams like a common issue. Is Spotify going to rectify this? Or get back to their paying users with more information? otherwise its best to go somewhere else which I will probably do shortly,0
Just plain great. There are some little stuff that i would change (like the ability to sort by multiple categories) but going from buying music to syreaming is the best decision i've ever made.,1
Absolutely incredible. Keep up the good work.,1
"Get,out this app is so good to have you can listen to great music and the music is family friendly with kids bop on it I would recommend it for all ages#best music app ever",1
Often have to restart app several times to get music to play or playlists to load. Very frustrating.,0
Best app for the songs,1
"I've been using and paying for Spotify premium since I was in 7th grade. I am now a college sophomore and thinking of cancelling my well-loved subscription because of the constant skipping of songs. I don't know why or when exactly the problem started, but almost every song skips like a bad record and I haven't found a single effective solution. reinstalling, reporting the bug, opening and closing ect ect. I love this app and I would hate to lose it, but this issue is incredibly frustrating.",0
Love it is simple to use,1
I love spoyify but I can't download songs on my phone,0
Need a down arrow for disliked tunes. Recommended lists are way to repetitive. I don't like the videos taking up my dashboard real estate. I never watched them. At this point YouTube Music is superior.,0
Has the best selection totally recommended this to everyone I use this now instead of youtube,1
Too much adds don't download it otherwise more than songs you will get adds ðŸ˜’,0
"such a good app, with or without premium they have lots of songs and i know it can be a little annoying when spotify adds songs to your playlist but the songs they add are based off your recent searches so theyre not even bad songs and at least when you watch and ad you get rewarded with 30 mins of uninterupted listening! they have basically every song. such a great app... and its free too!",1
"I love Spotify however some of the safety features can be annoying such as if I'm a passenger in a vehicle but my Spotify is connected to the car I can't watch the video attached to the podcast I'm watching. Also, I occasionally have connectivity issues. Otherwise it's great.",1
Changed my previous back to 5 stars. The ability to preview songs before adding them to your playlist is back. Back to being my favorite music app :),0
I have been using this app for years and I haven't felt the need to look for another music app,0
Best music listening app out there,1
"Dear Spotify ""Ye teri Chand baliya"" I hate this song just because of you!!! Advertisement",0
I had a pro account that was cancelled and it still charged me for next payment what is going on here spotify robbing ppl of their money also my suggested playlists never contain a single song that i search to play multiple times and even faved,0
Good ,1
"Everything is great, except one major issue, the recomended for this list... list, is mainly the exact version of the songs i have in my list, this is really my only problem",0
No way to turn Spotify off. ðŸ˜• Had to uninstall it to get it to stop. Pausing it doesn't shut it off.,0
"It was working great on mobile till end of March. Now I need to restart my phone every time I want to listen to my music. Paid service, it is just wrong.",0
"I love Spotify but everytime I try to listen to it, it keeps cutting off. I have to either unlock my phone to start it again or go back into the app. Please can this be sorted.",0
"This is an app that is impossible to run freely, so get premium it's worth it having your own library to play whenever you want. But my issues is Spotify's attitude toward musicians who get paid little from this service and choose to leave. Between YouTube music and this, YouTube Music is superior because EVERY artist and song is there.",1
"I like it I just have one problem, if I have a playlist and I play it, the app plays songs I didn't even like or add to it. I hate it and I get frustrated with it. If someone knows how to fix this PLEASE tell me.",0
Why is this so hard to play what I want I just wanted to hear my forevet song please fix it I want to play songs I want but it won't let me it just moved to a another song please fix it,0
I gotted so surprised to create a account but my mom setted up the family mix playlist through Spotify quite well and the 2021 actual excat playlist super duper pumped figured out a clue,1
Spotify is easily the best streaming app.,1
The fact that I can listen to legends like AYINLA Omowura and Yusuf Olatunji without going through my parents archives is just enough for the 5 stars.,1
This app sucks it won't turn off shuffle,1
"On the mobile version without premium, you can only listen to the full version of songs with shuffle. I can't choose any songs I like .",0
"just updated to the newest version. It is unstable. Song stopped abruptly, suddenly. Sometimes Play/pause button don't show up. Can I revert back?",0
Great way to connect music of different styles. I love the multiple choices of flavor and variety.,1
Very good ,1
"Used to be a good app. Now it will pick Playlists I don't even listen to, nor have I ever listened to them. With the free version you will listen to 3 ads before maybe two songs if you're lucky. Going back to Pandora or just sticking with YouTube.",0
I love your program. The music I find there is fantastic,1
"The remote feature may work on other phones, but it doesn't work on the stupid Pixel 6!",0
"Before october 2021, i was enjoying the app, i can play any songs, but when october 2021, it changed every thing, i need premium to play songs... this app when from free to pay... thats why i rate it a 1",0
Very nice ,1
"Great user experience, with varied music catalogue. Perhaps a Hi-fi resolution would be the icing on the cake.",1
"One of the best music streaming apps but the only problem is that it stops playing music after a couple of minutes, then I have to open the app again",0
"depth and archive of all different music is phenomenal. And free, incredible. The ads. are first class.",1
I enjoy using this app and it never gives me any problems not to mension the music it got,1
Spotify gives the best feeling â¤ï¸ðŸ’¯,1
Zero interruptions when playing music.,1
"Fix the bloody fwd rwd buttons, they don't work when my phone is locked and I know its happening to others too. It also gets stuck on a song or podcast on the screen but it's playing another. It stays stuck for a few minutes then freaks out, shuts down and you have to reopen. I'm really considering moving to Deezer. I pay for premium but still get the in-podcast apps that I then can't easily fwd through without unlocking my screen.",0
Not working in IQOO Z6 5G mobile. Resolve this issue,0
I can't download over wifi unless I select to allow download over data.,0
"I use Spotify daily but since the last update, I can't seem to scroll through the genres of my liked songs, please fix it",0
Same issues persist as with the previous version: disappearing inapp player and music stops randomly.,0
"With so many updates this app went through and still acting the same, there a problem with that I can't automatically play a music when im paired with Bluetooth, I have to go to the actual app and play musics, its so super annoying..........",0
"I used to use YT vanced, it was a good app for BG music then i downloaded this, no doubt this is a good music streaming app but ads after every song?? One ad says that 30 mins interrupted songs and after that song again there is a ad, disappointed",0
I love music ðŸŽ¶â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ and I also like to listen music on Spotify ðŸ’• thank you.,1
"Absolutely perfect except for the fact that (without Premium) I can only replay songs from my personal playlists on my tablet. However, I can replay my songs that are on my daily mixes ;) Recently, however, Spotify has been messing with my phone. I know it is spotify because when I uninstall it, the stuff stops. Spotify, please stop pausing and skipping my music, stop pausing my YouTube videos and not letting me play them. Stop playing your music at random times when the app isn't even open.",0
I give only one star because too much of ad... After every song 1 mins ad... Too much of ad... It's irritating... .,0
"Every time my phone restarts, this app moves my entire 30GB library onto my internal storage from my SD card. Why??? Makes my phone unreasonably hot and power hungry for an hour just to move them back. It's also been nearly a year since Spotify Hi-Fi was announced, and NOTHING has been said about it since, other than rumours that it will be an extra fee on top of premium. Considering this, I'm thinking about switching to Apple Music or another service. I've waited too long. Happens on tablet too",0
Best music apps for all ages.,1
"Duo premium problem. I have paid for the duo premium and sharing with my husband, however my husband can't get it, it keeps saying ""it seems you are trying to connect from a different country""... He has a Spanish number. We live in Spain. We live in the same household. Could someone please help us",0
"Idk why y'all decided to delete my review. Funny how the Bluetooth still won't connect and glitches and randomly pauses though. Very, very funny. Edit: not even a hour later and it's saying I don't internet when I clearly do",0
"I used to love Spotify and would always use it but for a while now whenever I try to play a playlist it will just play suggested song or it would play my playlist for a few minutes then play suggested song, I don't always mind that but when it's happening constantly it gets annoying and I just want to listen to my playlist not suggested songs. Its also just been randomly turning my music off after playing a song or when I pause it when I'm on another app or my phones off and it's really annoying",0
Thanks for reverting the playback control buttons to their initial places.,1
"The app isn't the problem it's the weird fact of having subscriptions, premium is too good to be true like you have to pay in-app in order for you to have privileges. Like fast forwarding a song, adding a playlist on the current anyways you know what I mean. This app has the best interface and smooth experience but the downside is the features. Not everything has to have a price every once and a while. :(",0
I loathe that this is the best option available but it is what it is. Needs uninstalling and reinstalling nearly weekly for simple pause play to function. Shuffle disappears from the controls at random. Pauses itself at random.,0
Very classics,1
Love the Playlist. Premium is worth it due to no ads and unlimited skips. The podcasts are awesome.,1
"Cannot access any music using the app, have to log in vis the website to listen to music. The app doesnt seem to work anymore on my phone",0
Awesome love the choices and the made for you playlist,1
"It's a really good source for music , easy to use ....you can save thousands of songs on a custom play list , I love it the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because sometimes the app glitches a lil but other than that they are fine!",1
I enjoyed it when I first try it but after the last update I can't play the songs that I want it's always in a shuffle instead of playing the song that I want it plays a different song,0
I liked it before they started updating it I couldn't press any music and have to shuffle to press the playlist it used to be so fun but now I'm thinking of switching it or just doing something about it.,0
"For the most part this app has been amazing. Recently, have encounter a wave of problems. Bugs out and randomly stops playing. You have to restart the app everytime you want to use it or it will bug out. Won't show what's playing and controls at bottom of screen. Won't load my downloaded Playlist when offline which is literally the purpose of downloading. Sometimes will say no internet connection so you can't pick a song but can skip to the next song if you were already playing one.",0
Best music I just need premium.,0
Good music and easy to find,1
Very very bad app doesn't let you listen the song you want to you have to play the whole Playlist and there are soo many ads. THIS IS VERY BAD APP DONT DONWLOAD,0
The only thing that keeps this app going is the fact that it uses less battery than YouTube and Apple music isn't available to Android users. You can't even rewind a song without hearing 3 ads. Then they tell you that you have 30 minutes of ad free music. That lasts until you click a song. Or for about 10 minutes. What the hell happened to this app??,0
"i love this app, but its not good without premium bc with premium you can skip unlimited songs but without you only can skip 6 per hour 5$ is not much if you wanna have no adds and unlimited skipsðŸ˜",0
Songs suddenly stop playing and the controls disappear. I'm a long time Spotify user and fan but this has being going on for weeks with no patch,0
"Some nice content, just hard to find things I like. And I frequently have to press play again when it just stops multiple times in the middle of a podcast.",0
Im opening this app again and again turning on my data. But its always saying no internet.,0
Locks up frequently moving from video podcasts to music. Have to reset the phone. I absolutely can't believe Spotify has the nerve to give me ads on top of existing ads with joe Rogan podcast when I pay for maintenance device premium service. Three months later still same issues. Still a problem,0
"After the latest update, widget is not loading on my main screen. How spotify can manage to find a way to mess itself up time and time again is beyond me.",0
A premium Spotify member and I have issues with Spotify turning itself off or not playing whole songs and then starting up again. I don't feel like I should pay for something that does not work properly I've tried the tricks with logging out of everything and making sure the apps are closed instead of suspended. still doesn't work. Please addressed and resolved. thank you. If there was a app that gave me what spotify does without the problems and charged me more I'm would switch without a doubt,0
Easy to use and wide range of albums so you don't have create your own play list.,1
This is a good application for music but theirs ads,0
"I'll appreciate your app if you remove autoplay, I'm turning off the autoplay but it just seems that it still on",1
Couldn't play request songs.. Also I couldn't unsubscribe till the first payment was made..I never used spotify cause its to complicating,0
Once my phone is about half full: it won't download properly. It erases other songs ; and if I go offline; it only plays a few albums.,0
"Version 8.7.20.1661 HW: Pixel 3 Android: v12 The application stop playing music randomly very often. The application itself does not appear to crash, but the music stops playing abruptly every 15-20 minutes. The application seems to get into idle state. There is no way I can press play to resume where the music had stop. 2 stars, because this needs to be fix.",0
Very Bad App There Are Too Much Ads,0
"What an utter pain in the butt. I thought I could download and listen to my choice of music with this, I am obviously wrong coz I make up my play lists and likes and next spotify have added things I didn't want so In the end uninstalled the app and won't use again think I'll just go back to old fashioned cds and put on laptop the transfer to my mobile",0
"Controls keep disappering, Bluetooth is now all of a sudden disconnecting. These are basic functions! Please fix it.",0
"It's ok, but $10/month is too much to pay, especially knowing how little the artists actually get out of that money.",0
Sound quality of songs are very good and most of songs are available irrespective of language.,1
"Is it too much to ask for one song to be played for free? I understand you need your money Spotify but I have to pay to get features that YouTube has? Yeah no I'm going back to just listening to YouTube on loop so I don't have to deal with this nonsense, how do you expect me to pay for features that should be basic? I can't loop a song unless I pay money. Pathetic.",0
"If you don't have premium, have fun listening to ads every 2 songs. On top of that you can't play a certain song in a Playlist.",0
Like it but one i want to put on dound it gives you a diffrentvsong and you have to search for the song,0
I love this app its great for music and it's very easy to use I would recommend it,1
I just installed the new update and when I got into spotify to listen to my old songs they all changed I tried to find the original ones but they were gone why did this happen? This update ruined everything every song I liked got randomized and led me to a diffrent song I had no idea about and that is not a good thing. You screwed up and I'm going to a diffrent app,0
"Spotify is amazing. You will not regret subscribing! And if you have older children who want it too, the family plan is awesome! Highly recommend. I have discovered so many artists from the recommended songs that start to play after the song you search for finishes.",1
very nice,1
Choice of collection is too good. It appears as if a customized collection of Album for me.,1
"Love Spotify but I wish it could have the download feature and for me to listen to my podcasts offline. Overall, 4 stars",0
"After the recent update I had constant app crashes, the play bar disappears constantly, the notification doesn't work. Just so a rollback ffs",0
When I try the app it is good but on the 2nd day theres a bug that I can't play any music because if I play a music or anything it will force stop even with wifi connections. I tried to uninstall and install it but nothing still have the bug. Pls help,0
Really like this app and I can listen to my songs all day long. There's few music apps that can touch this,1
It a good place to listen to music and watch podcast.,1
Please add option of setting wapaper of artist on phone like groove music in windows,0
I live for music and podcasts Makes working tolerable,1
Excellent source of podcasts. Music is good too.,1
Can Spotify add the ability to create folders that are currently on the desktop to the mobile version?,0
It's the best way to receive apps for iphone messages music android other options as well give it a try Im Sure you will love it,1
The app is great but one major issue I haven't been able to like any songs for the last few days or remove any liked songs it was working days before but then the like button stopped working and it hasn't been responsive since,0
Great app for music and it's seamless multiple-device connectivity is amazing.,1
Great. Works. Has shows I like. Music with ads is like aids. 5/5 will do again.,0
"As a creator, innovator,and proformer of fierce dynamic progressive AMBIENT you guys have truly been. the SPOT...iflyist online personalized music app........SONIK.1 formerly d.j ICâ‚¬â„¢â‚¬",1
in the age of fingerprint login; spotify lags way behind where in subscriber has to uninstall the app and login again with phone number. This makes people to distrust spotify and rely on youtube music. Spotify should implement an easy login technology where in userid and password wud be automatically detected by the phone number or by google account. Nowdays people tend to forget even login ids ( forget passwords..!!?). It should be as easy as login in to Youtube music app !,0
"Was working good for me, but since a recent update, I have to keep force quitting the app to get the app to properly work. The new feature for the bar that has the play button it keeps disappearing and I can't play or pause music without force quitting.",0
Im specially after UI in every app. Spotify is so friendly and looks amazing. If there a option to hide and show the current playing music by swipe up and down would be very usefull. :),1
I'm on the road a lot for business. Spotify works and keeps me jamming everywhere I roam.,1
Excellent and lovey way to listen unlimited music. Please make language wise categories i.e. Sindhi music or urdu music,1
We will experience more advertisement than expected... It's last sometimes 5 min also ... This is irritating... It's ads are much more.... This is the only reason I gave only 2 star rating,0
"All features are good except the problem of showing no internet connection while searching a song even when there is good internet connection, i think this issue is faced by many users.",1
"Doesn't load at all on my S22. It's a subscription based app, and it NEEDS to work more than 1/5 times I open it. So frustrating. Search function is always broken and I just stare at an endless loading wheel no matter how many times I force restart the app/restart my phone etc.",0
Why do i have less songs then before and trying to recover them and they can't play wth is this,0
It's all I use to listen to music and podcasts,1
Not quite good when it comes to offline local music cuz it won't play,0
Spotify has best podcasts and I like the format better than most platforms.,1
Great but recently crashing. The ad will run and then skip Playlist completely. Showing the half listened to podcast as played. Very inconvenient.,0
"You guys need to do a better job of filtering your songs. Please. HOME BY SNOW AALEGRA IS NOT AN EXPLICIT SONG BY ANY MEANS, WHAT EVEN??? And songs that are actually explicit still remain, especially songs in other languages. Very annoying.",0
Full ads iam not inresting,0
Love this! Has all the music I love!,1
App is User friendly with wide choice of music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ. I recommend Spotify to the music lover's those who wish to listen the music Keep it up Team Spotify ðŸ‘,1
"Cyber beggers, begging for premium subscription in between every songs.",0
"Good song selection but SO MANY BUGS. Spotify, you have to stop trying to load my DOWNLOADED SONGS on wifi, it is so infuriating. Also, I often click on my downloaded ""liked playlist"" and it shows up blank. Please fix your app",0
"I couldn't sign in and all the times I faced with error ""there is something wrong, try again later"" ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸",0
"Terrible, can't play my playlist in the order i set it, only shuffle is available, terrible features i can't believe this is the same company that has an actually good user experience on PC. Bring this up to your own standards please.",0
"I can still access my playlists and play songs on the web browser, but through the mobile app, i cannot",0
Love the selection and genres,1
Love streaming ads ,1
"Really silly that you only offer the Hulu bundle to students. Was considering re-instating my premium, but it's definitely not worth $10 a month for just Spotify. Add Hulu option to that $10 ticket for everyone else and I'll consider it. Ridiculous.",0
Best music app out there. The sound quality is great,1
This app delivers more than just what I expected. Very good.,1
While In session when adding songs in queue there's a small pause in the currently playing song please fix ... It's like glitch or something ...,0
"Well, good app but there is only two problems I don't wanna tell you to give the premium app for free but just about some glitches which are not at all good. I can't play any song that I search but I can play the song which I have added to my playlist, even my net is 5mbps then also your app shows you don't have any connection. But your app is good just you need to fix this problems that's all. Thankyou.",1
I was a Pandora user for a long time but the interface on Spotify completely kills it!,0
This is an exceptional music streaming service. The pros of going premium far outweighs the cons. I'm going to enjoy it very much but please bring back the anime tab on the discover page,1
The ads are really annoying but the sound quality and the amount u have to choose to listen to are really good. All in all not bad.,1
This app is nice,1
Listened to this app for a few years now I loved it But on vacation it stopped working and continues saying an error has occured Try again Ive cleared the cache Uninstalled the app Reinstalled it still wont work and wint even let me sign up again and make another acct 5 stars if it worked,1
"After the recent update, the player in the app started to disappear randomly and I have to close it and open it again for it to appear again. Quite annoying. UPDATE:I think it's fixed now",0
Play/Pause bar is disappearing...? Why??,0
"I love to listen to my music on the way to and from work as well as when I get home and I find it is great that at the touch of a button I can get any artist,album or song I like. Keep up the great work and I have already recommended this app to friends and family.",1
This is amazing for music exept ad but that is not often though and it has every type and language of music you can also see kpop music so i gave it a 5 star recommending for best music,1
"I love this app, the musics are awesome and unique.",1
"Great App, even without premium. I don't mind not being able to choose the exact song i want, i just made playlists for the right mood, being able to hear my favorite artists in the background even while my screen is turned off or I'm in other tabs is what i searched for Thank you for developing this app!",1
You are able to listen to your music but it would put random music that you don't listen to,0
If you're a podcast lover they've got a lot of exclusives besides JRE. Spotify is still my favorite platform for podcasts. Although my one gripe with it is that notifications for new episodes don't come on time and I get them way later than I should.,0
App was force closing when I try to play anything...,0
"Uninstalling. Will miss Every Little Thing podcast, sorry you are a casualty in this, please find a different platform.",0
"Things are good except the auto start feature which is the worst. The song starts playing as soon as a BT headset or speaker is connected. Doesnt look like there is an option to change it. On phone, we can stop the background process to prevent this. However this will also prevent the app from running and playing songs on the go with screen turned off.. Please fix this asap. Its annoying..",0
"When I go to my playlist on my phone it will always say ""something went wrong have another go?"". Can it be fixed please",0
Mobile app is rather good but on wearOS the app is very limited. I can't even search for anything.,0
"Really good app! I dont know why there are so many bad reviews, an app like this is extremely hard to develop. :D",0
Wide variety of music. Almost every artist is on here. My only problem is the amount of ads. If you don't have premium you could receive up around 7 ads at a time. Maybe it change I don't know because it got so bad I had to get premium.,0
Spotify used to be great to use however these recent updates have not been great. I dont have access to my liked songs and it wont play songs outside the app :/,1
Please make sure that the panels don't lag on low internet connection. Why would I have to wait so much time just to add a song I have downloaded to my queue,0
"Great app, does exactly what it says.with no issues or lag.",1
Best music app out there great for podcasts too,1
This is very bad app the problem is shuffle,0
Image free version pls!! It would be nice for my teen to be able to use Spotify without seeing all the images. Teens are not necessarily in the same age group as the kids spotify. So they want to listen to latest artists...but they don't need to be seeing adult images that are often too graphic.,0
It is amazing amazingly perfect for listening to music ir podcasts.,1
The app is very slow and stopped working so I contacted customer support and was passed around to 8 people who all just kept telling me to logout and login again and Uninstall then reinstall. In 5 hours 1 person actually was useful until they just asked dumb questions again. I have not been able to listen to anything since right after I was billed and when I asked for a refund it said I couldn't bc is was past 14 days but I paid on the 6th and it's the 19th so it hadn't even been 14 days.,0
Option to save my ðŸŽ¶ to a personal library! Opens in GPS Waze App enhancing my commute ðŸš—âœŒï¸â¤ï¸,0
"Tidal guy but Spotify is growling on me. Works better right now. Might be my phone but I doubt it. I'll have my mind made up for sure in 6,well 5 months",0
Fantastic app. Best music ever. Anything you looking for old or new you'll sure find it here,1
I have premium most of the time it doesnt work on dot,0
If you ever want to listen to music this is the one,1
Very very good. Even the free version.,1
"Loved it but I can no longer listen to the 30 second song clip when I want to add songs to my playlist, I don't khow if it's a bug or something else",0
"spotify is amazing but please add the option to reorder your playlists on the phone. It used to be there but now when I click edit playlist there's only an option to change the image, title, and description.",0
"I have been using Spotify for 12 years and it only continues to worsen in quality. For months now the app does not function correctly regardless of usage. It glitches the play bar away and continues to display ""trying to play"". Cannot skip or pause, have to fix myself. Crashes. Shuffle algorithm struggles to do it's job. App is intolerable w/out premium. You get ads anyway. Service allows for hit farming from noncreators & uses an unethical and unfair system to pay out. Apple is more ethical :/",0
NICE,1
"EVERY time you try to use the app offline for more than a couple hours, all of the songs in your queue get deleted and you can't add anything to the queue anymore. The only thing you CAN do is play shuffle and hope something good plays (you can't see what will play next either). What is the point of having premium and downloading songs in your phone if the app breaks everytime you go offline? When you are at a farm or roadtrip without internet, spotify is useless. Better look for something else",0
"Stopped working. Uninstalled, installed new still won't load. Either stuck on logo or black screen",0
It's amazing app to song platform,1
Moving to deezer who pay artists better and better fidelity. Also their family sub has better options.,0
Since last update the app randomly crashes.,0
Spotify is having a lot of issues when downloading song using an sd card.,0
"Very relaxing, has all kinds of types of music.",1
In the middle of songs its pauses and then restarts the whole song. You have to go into the app and play the song again.,0
The best music app had it for almost ten years!,1
"This app worked well until v8.6.98.900, when trying to install newer versions of the app, my pioneer car system wouldn't work with spotify anymore. This means that I have to upgrade all my apps manually to be able to keep the last working version of their app. Hope spotify will fix their broken app soon.",0
Really good app. Almost covers each and every song this planet has ever heard. Only thing that bugs me is multiple advertisements. It's ok to have one advertisement in between. But sometimes they make us hear 2-3 advertisements in a row. XO,1
The only problem about this app is the add but still it is a very great app to listen to music,1
"Song/music selection is so easy to get plus other artists with a similar song/genre is available, making you're playlist far more enjoyable....",1
It's the best of all apps made to listen songs ! Go for it,1
Newest update screwed up the mini player and the notification player. The mini player doesn't show up in the app and it doesn't update the notification player with the current song.,0
"It's overall great, but it's usually slow to load when I have something connected on Bluetooth.",0
When will the liked songs order become customizable like a proper playlist? We all want to know.,1
"Used to love this but nowadays the app has become buggy, player stays in notification even after i close the app, i have to reopen it then close it to remove the notification. Music randomly pauses sometimes and i don't know why canavs feature is not available in India even after 2 years of it's launch.",0
"Can't access downloads without connection. It's so absurd, I download things because I love in an area that doesn't have cell reception everywhere. The app tries to load entire libraries before it will allow navigation to downloads. Negating the entire purpose of downloads. Plus the navigation is just silly/unintuitive.",0
Find of the day- a mix made for me based on listening habits. also:Delightful search result to find artist by lyrics. Found same song other artistic productions. lLOVED the choice of interpretation!,1
Excellent app to enjoy all types of music,1
"Its a really good app, however, I cannot get into Spotify as of right now. I have Spotify Premium, and I have had it for a while, but I do not know if its how much space I have or if Spotify is just acting up.",0
6skips per hour +they will force you to listen in other song that you don't even want so you are most likely to skip it that's where the annoying part is gonna start... 6skips won't be enough to play the song you want like I mean literally.,0
Best Music Platform ever â¤ï¸,1
"So... avid Spotify paid subscriber for many many years.. Never an issue, love Spotify.",1
"The bell button with notifications isn't opening, an error ""Something went wrong"" pops up every time - it's not been fixed for 2 updates straight Also please make an access to podcasts for Ukraine!! We are waiting for them too long",0
It is a very nice app for listen musics and enjoying podcasts. We can also make playlist. Wonderful app,1
This is exalent you shoul download the only prablom is why do you habe to get premium to download songs,0
It could use some videos with some songs that have them.,0
"Started advertising podcasts at me by someone who spreads dangerous misinformation. If those are the values Spotify wants to align themselves with, I can gladly listen to music on YouTube Premium.",0
"It's the best music streaming service out there, especially if you're a student! The only real downside with this service is that it doesn't have HIFI support that it's competitors like Tidal have. But excluding that, it's a great service that has a very wide selection of artists and a great UI.",1
Stops playing at random. So many bugs.,0
Unusable trash. Spinning green wheel of death when trying to play anything.,0
Love it,1
It's a good app for music.,1
I use Spotify all the time! I make collaborative playlists with friends and enjoy podcasts at work. I just wish it was easier to sort my pods so I can find episodes which I started but couldn't finish.,0
"I don't think I have ever run into a problem with Spotify itself, I use It to stream all my music and the sound quality you get with premium is way worth it",1
I don't like that you have to have premium to play specific songs and that I can only listen to playlists,0
"Service is great, app is fine. I wish there was an easy way to see all songs by an artist rather than just top songs. Other streaming services do this better. Spotify integrates into other tech (PS5, Peloton) better though.",1
"Podcasts app sucks. Spend some effort improving your podcast app before buying up established podcasts people love. Makes me wanna cancel my subscription for music it's so bad UPDATE - now I'll listen to ads on podcasts too. Before I understood/accepted why creators had ads on their podcasts, but now spotify expects me to pay monthly for their service while they will buy up existing podcasts to add in ads to double dip on existing audiences while adding nothing only taking.",0
"The new update is the worst. When I search for a song and want to add it directly to a playlist, I hate that the three dots next to it which allowed me to do that have now disappeared, forcing me to play that song. I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THE SONG BEFORE ADDING IT TO MY PLAYLIST. it disrups my existing queue. this update is so useless?? It makes no sense whatsoever",0
i cannot hear my fav song at my list,0
"Doesn't play music if there is an update available. The music player will show music playing, but no sound is to be heard, even in wireless ear buds. Just have to update and takes care of that issue.",0
Why? I play the song and other song playeddd whyyyyyyy I'm so desapoindet,0
Really nice to be able to pick a song or band you want to hear and you hear it,1
"Download songs cannot play, offline mode is useless Download a album, went down the tub with no reception. Click on the album, it stuck at loading the song list.... Turn on offline, still stuck at loading the song list in album.",0
"I've used spotify for years and I can't explain the experiance that this app has given me. The playlists it makes for me are great and I love every single song they have on there. I used to get told all the time that Apple music is better but with Spotify, you get what you couldn't from Apple music. With every add I hear, I find a new song that I like. Thank you Spotify for giving me the music I have and continuing this amazing app!!!!!",1
"The music is nice, but there's actually less music on this service because of how firm and proud they are about their official stance of loving to spread harmful misinformation for profit.",0
App is crashing whenever I try to play a song. Reinstalled but it makes no difference. Can't even use it right now,0
4 minutes of ads back to back after I paid for the premium. What's up with that?,0
Excellent music source even in free mode,1
Nice audio experience and with lyrics it's amazing. But you're showing too much of ads which makes it irritating to use. Showing ads are ok but you are showing it frequently. This will make the users to pissed off including me. Solve this ads issue in the next update. Three stars are fair enough to give according to me.,1
I find myself using apple music more nowadays because of the lossless stream option. The difference in audio quality is night and day.,0
"I want more control on my home screen, especially to hide offensive podcasts as I don't want my kids to be exposed to them or have to see them myself. I also want to be able to down thumb any song, anywhere in the app and never have it play again. The Pandora thumb up/down method is better than the Spotify heart method as on Pandora I rarely have to listen to media I don't like unlike Spotify. I would also encourage Spotify on better choices when it comes to investing in podcasters...",0
Love it,1
New user. Easy to use. Great playlists. Easy to get to liked songs.,1
"I love that Spotify supports our constitutional right to free speech. If for no other reason that this, I would support them. However, the app is well structured and, the algorithm (or whatever it is) works well to play the music I like. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘",1
"Normally, Spotify is great. Lately the play back has sucked. Frequently stops, loses its place, and the controls won't pop up.",0
Great app I pay for service too and no problems. People need to pay and it will work better.,1
Log in problem please fixx ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
"Love you all except when the ads come in, then I just want to storm your office and dump your servers into the sea. ðŸ’›",0
I don' t like this app.I can't listen my favourite song in play list with out premium .Because the playlist does not play the songs we want.,0
I will honestly change this review to 5 stars the second this development team adds the swipe to queue feature that iOS has had for years. It's much slower to have to tap on the three dots and add to queue and I don't know why they haven't added it since Apple's had it for years. But I really hope they add it because it's basically the only thing I think this app is missing EDIT: they did it :),0
Good app has a great range of music it's cool and easy to use ! I have some issues when yous delete popular songs though I would love it if you could do that,1
I really loves this app is great I've give it a five stars,1
Doesn't let me play my playlist just put some random songs instead,0
All of a sudden I keep losing the ability to manage the podcasts I.e. pause or rewind and have to keep logging out and sometimes reinstalling the app to get this working again.,0
Awful i hear more ads and less songs,0
Spotify Cares doesn't care at all when we demand to fix an issue immediately regarding a song that has been hacked.,0
Good music and good shuffle play. Sometimes it pauses the music when I receive a notification. Good if you buy the subscription. So glad I don't have to hear the ads anymore.,1
I don't know what is going on but recently the app crashes at least 3 times within just one song and then makes it restart after taking almost a minute to even open the app. I seriously hope that it'll get fixed soon because it makes using the app almost impossible and extremely infuriating,0
Good app for listening music. But there is add coming after every 2 songs,1
"Good selection of music. My only problem is how often Spotify cuts out. Like every song even the downloaded ones. It makes the listening experience poor. I read somewhere this maybe a samsung issue, but no idea how to fix it. May just have to switch to a different app.",0
"The android app is very glitchy. The audio controls dissappear randomly when playing a podcast, and then can't be found, leaving no control without restarting the app. The player also occassionaly stops momentarily and repeatedly during playback, like someone repeatedly stepping on the brakes on a nice country drive.",0
Good,1
I like spotify as a service but the app has been really frustrating for a while now. I wear a lot of PPE for work and I used to be able to load up the queue with stuff and not worry about it for a couple hours. Now it's pointless. The app just forgets things immediately and worse it insists on playing stuff I've just listened to! So frustrating that after at least 5 years I might just switch to a different music service.,0
S22 ultra. There's been an issue where music randomly stops playing and the Player controls vanish. Have to restart the app to get it working again.,0
"Best music app. I've been using it for about 2 or 3 years and it's been great. The ads are kind of a problem but it doesn't really bother me. I hate that there's only 6 skips per hour. But the app is still great. Has all the music i look up. Country, rap, all the stuff I love. 10/10",1
love it! yhe only problem is that even with spotify prime i still don't have the lyrics button,0
Hands down best music app next to tube premium! Got all my favorite tracks n help me find new ones I wouldn't have found otherwise! My #1 trax app for!,0
"ðŸ’• this Station, I have my own Playlists, will be Upgrading. My Music ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ keeps me Sane!!",0
Excellent app while doing work out,1
Everything good just do something for advertisement like after 20-30 minutes ad should come,0
Good,1
Great app I truly appreciate and enjoy it what a Joy!!!,1
"So great indeed, every sort of music is available",1
It always says error everytime I subscribe to premium,0
"The app shuts down as soon as I play a song. It all started with the previous version of Spotify. I even talked to your support team and they told to wait for the latest update. I updated the app and the issue was gone for a few days. Now, I am facing the same issue again and I have tried everything I was told before. I reinstalled the app, tried to login my a/c in different devices but still no luck even after running the latest version of the app",0
Great. Great experience to search a song and maintain playlist user friendly also. I think it should be India's no 1 music app.,1
"Amazing , wide variety of great music with no ad breaks",1
"I like the app, but there are too many ads when I'm listening to music. ""Enjoy the next 30 minutes of ad-free listening."" But an ad plays two songs later",0
I will not say much but this is best app for listening music. Go ahead and Download it.ðŸ™‚,1
"Paying X amount per month, for a now flaw filled application, that pauses randomly, crashes randomly, puts on different songs from what was selected, and all in all has dropped in quality substantially. I used to love Spotify, had no dramas surrendering my money to this corporation, and now I'm contemplating other avenues because they can't just fix the mundane, petty flaws in their product. Disappointing to say the least",0
Nicely to find songs and some podcast is good app for me,1
"Player is shutting off intermittently again. Couple mths ago would shut off completely all the time. Ypu told me to sign out and reinstall. That worked. For about a month. Doing similar thing again. Frustrating!! Paying you money for a working product, please fix this issue!",0
"Not bad. It's free and the music I listen to is here. I feel like they read my mind. Also the talk shows are interesting. If I did have a complaint maybe it would be, they don't carry whole episodes of coast to coast with George Noory.",1
Easy to use and great parental settings,1
"It's a great app but some songs just won't play. I mean they get searched but won't get played after clicking on 'em, please try to fix this issue",0
I hate it all I can do is shuffle play and when I make a playlist it always add random songs that I don't even like fix these two problems and I'll rate it 5 stars,0
"I have had the app for years and always talk about how much I love the service, but all the sudden its unusable. It stops, crashes, discounts, doesn't show controls, and so on and so on; and we aren't talking once in a while it's 20 times in a podcast, if I am lucky I will get through a single song. I will give it a week to see if they fix it before I switch to a different service, but currently the app is unusable.",0
"I moved from Deezer to Spotify because Spotify is cheaper (I wanted a plan for 2 people, and Spotify Duo is cheaper than Deezer Family). Spotify is OK, but I still miss Deezer Flow. The Spotify daily mixes and weekly discovery and whatnot just can't replace my Deezer Flow. I've tried to like Spotify, I really really have. But at this point I'm strongly considering just paying more and going back to Deezer.",0
One star until they fix the disappearing play bar issue. Edit : they fixed it. 3 Star app.,0
Great way to listen to my favorite songs of the Gospel,1
"I don't think I could live without Spotify premium haha, takes all the fuss and effort out of getting music on a mobile device. The daily playlists and suggestions have helped me find a lot of artists id never have listened to otherwise, some have become absolute favourites.",1
"I don't really care about the ads at all. Though I'm concerned how much others get a lot of ads because it only has a bit for me. I love Spotify either way even if it has ads. I'm a bit broke to afford the ""better"" version :P Edit: Also I love that there's a mini version. I'm way too broke and only get money once a month.",0
This is absolutely ridiculous I'm paying member of spotify and for the last several months my Android phone is unable to skip ahead or see the now playing tools whatsoever anywhere in the app on my screen tool or on my car. If this is not resolved soon I'll have to cancel my membership after years of being a subscriber,0
It's such a good app I just lðŸ’œVE it i'm and army and k-pop fan I can listen song very clearly and good quality it doesn't require more data also it's a good app ðŸ˜âœŒâ¤ðŸ’œ and one drawback is that it plays ads for every two songs it's just *trusfating*ðŸ™„ rather than that I just lâ™¡VE this appðŸ˜Š,1
"Awful app. Why am I unable to just see the tracklist of an album and play it through song by song? And when you press play on a playlist, it plays songs NOT from that playlist. Also you can only seem to play on shuffle... just going to go back to good old CDs.",0
I love listening to the music and it's for free and you don't even have to pay for it,1
"Spotify is great, but the App often does not show the playing song.",0
latest update causing my Kenwood radio to say still connecting. Kinda defeats the purpose of driving safe if I have to look at my phone to skip a song.,0
The application works well and as long as you pay you won't be bordered with ads. I'm happy with it.,1
Best music experience ever,1
"Worst experience ever. The UI is difficult, downloads dont download. I got this thinking I could put music on my phone but all I got was a headache and a monthly bill that took my like a solid 20 mins to figure out how to unsubscribe from.",0
Why do you add songs to peoples playlist if WE DIDN'T ADD them OURSELVES and why do random songs play if Spotify didn't add it to the playlist and nother did I like random songs will just start play for no f------ reason.,0
I can't log in again or create new account using my Gmail or email even can't get any options.,0
It's relaxing and not that much adds,0
"Personal playlists have ads,and when I play a song I can't change back the duration of the song,and those without premium cannot shuffle songs and CANNOT LOOP SONG,Spotify please make your app more convenient for those who can't afford premium",0
i can and will literally sit there for hours blasting my music through my headphones lol,0
Well it's been pretty good but lately I can't listen to some of my favorite podcasts and it's concerns but i love Spotify a lot,1
"Came to check the reviews to see if anyone else is having the same issues as me. Never used to have any problems with spotify, using it daily for years and years - but as others have said, this latest update has broken the media controls while a song is playing, and every now and then just cutting out for a few seconds at random. This has also broken Bluetooth handsfree support for listening in the car.",0
Songs were just stoped while using,0
Nice great to listen to all my podcast and enjoy music..,1
It won't let me unshuffle It's annoying and unprofessional,1
I just love Spotify and I'm so happy and satisfied with Spotify.,1
One of my best app to stream music,1
Updated ke baad ekdm bakvas ho chuka hai Bhai primium lena hi pre ga Waste hai Bhai Or bhi ache app hai,1
Why does the lyrics share button keep disappearing?,0
"This app suddenly stopped working. When try to play a song, it plays another random song. I don't know what is wrong with Spotify business team. Such a third class product.",0
"I normally love this app, but it always adds extra songs to my playlists. I'll have one country song in a playlist, and when I go back to it, there's ten more country songs! I'll have completely unrelated songs added to my playlists.",1
Great service. Ive had other as in Pandora etc. This by far is the BEST.,1
"I only downloaded this to support Spotify and have the option to hear a broad selection of opinions. I appreciate y'all at Spotify for providing a broad platform for information. It seems that mainstream media would rather run smear campaigns than provide reasons as to why something is ""misinformation"". I'm grateful for the integrity Spotify has shown, and I hope they prosper in spite of morally and intellectually bankrupt media outlets trying to drag them with baseless accusations. Thanks.",1
"Has been good for the past 4 years I've been using it, but recently it'll play random songs that aren't in my Playlist and aren't similar to the genre at all, will skip songs without me hitting the skip button, close the app without me doing anything, or just won't play songs at all. Please fix this. I will be switching to a different streaming service for now",0
Most amazing and best media music app you can play music offline download have your own music files extremely easy to navigate,1
Best music I like it,1
"this app is great, absolutely love it. but i have a recommendation. please, please, PLEASE, add a feature which allows you to speed up or slowdown songs PLEASE!!! it would literally be amazing and so useful PLEASE consider making this a thing.",1
"I've been using this app for almost 2 years now and i had no problems until now. Whenever i switch to offline mode my downloaded music and playlists don't play and now whenever i press on a song the bar thing at the bottom which shows the song i'm playing does not show, so i can't even pause or rewind or fast foward my songs and that is creating other problems as well. Please help",0
"What is wrong with your fkn app on Google Pixel 6.... Always no internet connection! WAKE UP!!! What is wrong with your app lately?? Been using it for years- and now the past 6months it's gone to rubbish! Never a connection found, and slow and jumpy....",0
Great selections of songs and the album they come from.,1
It's been years since I had a version of this app that didn't glitch out regularly. I've had a lot of problems with it stalling out and freezing. I have to do a lot of force stopping on this thing. It would be awesome if premium customers were able to skip podcast ads too. This isn't exactly the cheapest subscription service I have either.,0
Amazing app! Love it so much!,1
Spotify added lyrics to their songs and it's the best thing ever!,1
Love the clarity of music,1
When I tried to play a song it played one didn't want! Just let me play my song dont play a RANDOM ONE FOR NO RESON!!!!!!!!!,0
I've been a premium user for the past 7 years it's a great app the best honestly!!!,1
"I was going to give the app 4 stars, - 1 because the playlists are very weird. The algorithm for automated playlist is lacking compared to YT music. Then I couldn't login, because I have been overseas for more than 14 days apparently (? - during Covid times). So now I am stuck in a login loop, and going to YT music I guess ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤·",0
It's an amazing app for music but it does have its problems,0
Lovely app that curates playlists for you based on what you listento the most. Also finds similar artists and music that you might like and recommend it to you. YOU CAN FIND ANY SONG ON THIS APP. If ypu love music go for it.,1
Had to change the rating from 5 to 3 stars due to the constant pop up of allowing Bluetooth to connect every day that I open the app. Why is this option not saved? Very annoying.,0
"It's gotten so bad recently. The ads are so much louder than the music. After hearing a mellow song and being blasted at double the volume an ad really sucks. Now the app also strated to just stop playing and needs to be force shut down, most of the time it seems to get stuck at playing an ad, even though my internet connection is good.",0
"very disappointed that im no longer able to add full albums to my playlist. only can add individual songs, same with queuing songs.",0
Option to disable/enable lockscreen artwork will be a great touch. Better AMOLED friendly app would be appreciated.,0
Everytime i play a song it changes into something else fix it pls.,0
"Latest update is broken. Choppy music, lost controls, music playing when app closed?",0
The app and quality is damn good but I just suggest that there should be an option to chat with your friends if you add that it would be fantasticðŸ’¥,1
"used to be good, but automatic radio stations/discover weekly has been stuck on literally a whole selection of songs that are not only horrible but have nothing to do with my music taste",0
Nice sound quality..,1
I LOVED THIS A LOT NICE APP. DEVELOPERS ALWAYS TRY TO MAKE THIS APP MORE BETTER AND NICEðŸ˜Š,1
What is wrong spotify why is it everytime i play its always auto close,0
I thoroughly enjoy listening to my own music here on Spotify.,1
"Used to work great, but recently, when I tried to play a single song on loop, it would play many other songs too. Also, they are adding random songs to my Playlist that I can't get rid of.",0
Lost my Playlist and I'm a premium customer. Now I'll listen to someone else.,0
really easy to use and dope llus wide range of content,1
Love the capacity to send many attachments at one time,1
Revisiting and downgrading to 2 stars. Decent app but BASIC features have been removed. I pay Â£9.99 a month and can no longer see the number of tracks in a playlist...why did they remove that feature???,0
Absolute pleasure to listen and download.,1
"No complaints. Easy to use and great for making playlists for every situation from cleaning, working out, driving with the kids, or being at work. Also love the suggestions and Discover Weekly playlists based off of my listening.",1
Absolutaly amazing. I have no clue where I would be without spotify but it constantly needs updating,0
"All my music right at my finger tips, all in one place, all on my phone. Anytime anywhere!!!!!",0
"1. I can't listen to anything without an ad every time 2. I can't find songs only the playlist they are in even then I have to watch an ad to skip the other songs to get to the one I want to listen to 3.when I want to see what's next on a playlist I can't check 4. If I go to a playlist I can't choose the song I want to listen now , it just gives me a small bit of the song",1
Whoever approved the last update for release should be fired. App crashes multiple times and what happen to the control buttons. I'm a paid subscriber but won't be if I don't see another update soon,0
"Well It plays music, you choose and it plays it.",1
"It some times takes a second to load up, but otherwise still trading me well.",1
Constantly crashing over the last 3 months on Android. Spotify knows there are issues but isn't fixing them. What good is a streaming service if you can't actually stream?,0
Scam it only works if you buy Premium. I search some songs but when I play another songs automatically play. Is this a Bug? Or is just Spotify really just Favored those who in Premiums. æ™ºæ…§,0
"It's amazing but most of my favorite songs are being removed/unplayable. So I moved to YT music, it has everything & more.",1
"MASSIVE ISSUES SINCE RECENT UPDATE, songs aren't playing, songs aren't showing up while playing (making skipping forward, pausing and rewinding impossible), also has MASSIVE issues with Android Auto since the recent update (which claims to have fixed bugs, but really just added more), issue exists on my parents phones as well, we're thinking of switching to an app like Deezer of Tidal because they don't have these issues (and cause Deezer supports downloading onto and listening from Fitbit).",0
"Update ruined the app AGAIN! The recent update has caused major issues including no navigation bar when playing music which means you can't pause, skip or see your que. The app now has major issues connecting to Google Home and Android auto. Please stop making updates that make the app unusable. Some of us pay for this service.",0
It's really nice. Love the fact that they set a whole playlist of different artists all together,1
Apset my account twice charging my account for 6 months and I did not receive any of the credit back I do not recommend Spotify at all if not speak to a person at all you have to pay for another something me settle any dispute you have with them rip off,0
"Very nice one complaint is sometimes it requires you to buy premium to play your personalisation but it's kind of rare so overall amazing platform, great songs,podcasts and other related items!",1
"Free or Premium, definetly the best music app provinser, with a simple and mest design",1
"update 4/20/22: Ever since my upgrade to Android 12 Spotify has been so buggy. Sometimes I can't see the now playing bar and I have to completely close the app. Sometimes the song that the app says is playing doesn't change, but the song still changes. There's other issues too that I can't think of right now, but it's making Spotify really annoying to use",0
"I'm so in love with this app, cannot go without it EVER. I have found almost, most of island music. THANK YOU SPOTIFY.",1
I really like this application because I can listen to many of my favorite music and can sing because there are lyrics so singing becomes easier Ë˜,1
"Plays you 2 mins of ads, then a totally unrelated song. Meanwhile other services will at least play the song you've chosen after advertisements.",0
I downloaded this app for the enhance feature. I'm always looking for new music and the recommendations were spot on. It needs to be brought back.,0
Sweet sweet every song by my favorite artist just like that so cool,1
"Giving 2 star because- 1. Before the update I could hear my device's local music but now it's disappeared 2. After the update there are too many ads between 2 or 3 songs, it was not there before the update",0
Hey devops You killed the equalizer function with the latest update again Bring that back in please Highly utilized,1
Wonderful. I love this app I would highly recommend it for people who have a taste for music. There is just one problem with the app when I am trying to play a song the song just stops and disappears and I have to restart it. But honestly this is an amazing app and wonderful to collab with your friends Spotify is an amazing music app.,1
Best app for listening to music You get every song possible in Spotify,1
"Looooooove Spotify, have found EVERY song i can remember loving even since the age of 5",1
It sucks it want to play one song but it plays other fix your app spotify,0
"I've always liked it, even the free version. It's nice to be able to listen to do much.",1
"Issues with s22 ultra, app will continue to play when disconnect from Bluetooth and won't display pause as well sometime in app or in notification pull down. Have to force close app to stop music",0
Can find all the music I want and works offline anywhere so it's great for my job,1
Very nice,1
"So many issues recently. Things gave been bad since the last 2 or 3 updates. Music stops playing on its own. Sometimes the song listed isn't the one actually playing. Unable to stop current song playing and have to instead close the whole app. While in Spotify and the song is playing, unable to find control panel to stop or skip song.",0
Love Spotify...lots of music to choose from...the best!,1
I love Spotify but I hate ads,0
Variety and awesome music,1
"I am canceling my account and uninstalling the Spotify app in support of Neil Young's position, and more importantly, in support of truth and integrity in journalism. When Spotify bars its pod casters from promulgating lies and disinformation, I will happily return.",1
App updated yesterday (June 7) and now the app won't load and hangs... Was ok before,0
It is so great we can listen to any songs,1
"It's ok,, but now it doesn't have a widget for the lock screen, so I can't change songs without unlocking my phone, going into Spotify, and then hitting the button. Also my offline downloads constantly delete themselves out of nowhere, then I'm stuck with no music.",0
I Very Enjoy Music ALL In Once Times.,1
"It's a very good app for music...loved it a lot.. but today when I'm trying to open the app it's not working even after reinstallation, it's still not opening. Please fix the glitch",0
"Buggy mess. Don't use if you want to listen to podcasts. No player until you open the app back up and a lot of the time it's missing. I have to close the app and reopen just to find the pause button. Also it's way too sensitive and often accidentally skip the episode by the slightest ""swipe"" and often shows finished when I go back which is infuriating when the podcast is hours long. BRING US A PLAYER!",0
VERY BAD PERFORMANCE......It was a good app untill recently when the number of ads are increasing exponentially....every time for every other song....that's not fair.....Its better I uninstall it...,0
"Constantly bothers you to rate app, so here's my rating based on that experience. Rest of Spotify is fine except for the immense cache you have to clear time to time, and that your library won't load until you press next song and magically every song loads up, and how it can't stay in offline mode even if you pay for premium, and how it somehow uses more data to play songs on 5g even though streaming works just as well on an old 3g phone, and how discover weekly constantly throws mumble rap in.",1
It is nice but it has many ads,1
"The best application I have tried in my life and I advise everyone to try it and I like the quality and purity of the sound, and if there were 5 additional stars, my rating for it would have increased as well. In the end, I would like to say Vesca Barsa, Vesca Catalunya",1
"Not for me. Cluttered, too many cover songs. When I ask google speaker to play a song, it always plays a weird version. I went from Spotify to Amazon music. Much better. By the way, Spotify, I cancelled my subscription, why was I charged for this month?",0
After the latest update I can't play music on Spotify.(when I start a song the app close automatically),0
First the music wont show on the desktop wins app then go to browser to play was doing fine til today keeps logging me out my own account on the browser,0
"This app has worked great, but recently it has either stopped working casting the audio to external devices such as Cambridge Audio and Google speakers and devices.. If this is not fixed I will cancel subscription and rather switch to Tidal or something similar..",0
Excellent Online Music Platform....... And it also needs some improvements... Overall I loved it....,1
Very clear sound..I do meditation with Gurudev listening to spotify,1
"it was phenomenal, always suggested the songs I prefer, perfect quality, although without Spotify premium, it's pretty annoying getting ads and not being able to play the songs I want too",1
The Spotify is nice app and some people can't see lyrics because on Android phones it not works I think but i am using redmi phones and it's showing lyrics on redmi phone but on some songs it's not showing,0
Love using Spotify.,1
The app constantly freezes and resets where I left off during a song or podcast even with the latest updates. I do love the lyrics feature though.,0
Best of the best music ðŸŽ¶ apps.,1
"Such a great app for discovering new music,thanks to the members playlists.Very easy to find almost anything you could want.I still buy CDs as they're superior in sound quality;but saying that,it all depends on the system you're using. I'm happy using Spotify with headphones,and like I said,to find new music.",1
This app is very good i love it,1
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE APP BRUH ???? I stopped using for a while and now I just came back and everything is lagging to extreme cases to a blank screen altogether ... Probably will go with YouTube music ... What a disappointment ...,0
"Since the last update it keeps bugging and stops playing music every few minutes. The play/stop bar also disappears so you have to restart the app. You would think that with so many paying users they could do better than that, makes you wonder where they put their money.",0
"It's great! Tons of music to listen to. But, it'd be better if it didn't had different songs playing when I want to listen to my favorite song. It's a bit annoying but great app!! I gave this a 3-star rating since everytime I'll skip it keeps saying ""You've got a new feature!"" I thought pressing the get 1 month free button will stop it from appearing, it's so annoying. Edit: it also wastes my free skips.",0
"Support of racism has turned me off.. Been paying to support racism has made me a hypocrite. Going to cancel my subscription. Plus.. Lyrics option doesnt work.. Losing songs i like, and my daily playlist os jut my faves reordered Lyrics doesnt WORK. Nothing new.",0
"Got some troubles with synching app on pc and phone. Update: play bar keeps disappearing, app crashes, but no updates are available.. really annoying situation.",0
"Stellar. CD guy for many years. I have so much more money saved thanks to Spotify premium. Outstanding library, sound quality, features, and wicked user friendly. Highly highly highly recommend it.",1
Once again Spotify isn't working properly. Sort it!,0
This app should be listed as paid. It fools people into thinking it could be free with some ads here and there. After 2 months the ads start playing after every second song suggested songs(indian songs) are being put into your playlist. The experience I've had with this app is frustrating and deceiving especially if you don't want to pay.,0
Excellent music range and podcasts. Like the picks of the week.,1
I love Spotify it has almost every song and there it is super quick to search creators up,1
Not bad I will give it a go ,1
"They STILL haven't fixed the autoplay in car issue. People have been complaining about this for years, and Spotify just ignores us. I don't want Spotify to start when i get in my car, and i shouldn't have to create a Tasker profile to kill the app every time! That said, I love it for home use.",0
I do not agree with their service policies on numerous levels. Also the app crashed my phone a lot and you get more and better features if you just use the website.,0
"The Quality and Quantity of the music is great but have been having this bug; where it says nothing is playing but you can still here the musicðŸ˜•, and can't interact with things like the pause button. Would also like to be able to see how long a song is (without playing it - like on a playlist down the side) on phones & Tablets as there is no setting to make it show up. Thanks for a great music appðŸŽ§. Recommend if willing to pay.",0
"I'm so glad that I can find almost every song that I like. I wish they had my two favorite songs ""Still with You"" By Jungkook and ""Promise"" by Jimin. Other than that, it's great!",1
good,1
Overall Spotify has been a great way to listen to music. I love making playlists and listening to other stations and playlists too. Thank you!,1
I love it so much but the only downside is the adds hahaha but over all it's a good app specialy if you love music,1
It's good when u want to listen to music,1
I really enjoy with this facility,1
"When it works it's great. But lately it glitches constantly. I've contacted Spotify and followed all the requests for clean this and that, but it still stops for no reason. Please sort it out or lose another paying customer",0
Fantastic. Everyone said it was the best. Spotify delivers!,1
Great,1
"Please fix that your app is not remembering that I want to have in my library only ""downloaded"" category active. I think I will change music app because your app is getting worse and worse!",0
"The songs are skipping. What is this, ""throwback to CD"" filter? Fix it.",0
Easy to navigate and organize your tunes,1
Everything is great... no doubt...but Why do uh always show ads after saying no ads for 30 minutes ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’,0
"Worst customer service, I'm having issues where the app won't play the samples of music before deciding to add to playlist, get on the service chat, first over an hour and I guess they forgot about me, get om 2nd time with new person, wait 30 min even though they said they were looking into it, cam back and asked what the issue was, what were you doing for half an hour then tell basically turn it on and off, shockingly that didn't work...",0
Add to playlist doesnt show new playlists. Keeps disturbing me with pop ups.,0
I love this app. I can listen to my favorite songs and podcasts.,1
I had to delete and uninstall this app more than one time and I still have the same problem with it it's somehow decides to automatically start playing. Even over other media audio applications plus they keep changing the location of where you can shut off the permissions for that. It's absolutely trash and I would suggest that no one use it because it takes takes over too many permissions on your phone and it really really does spy on your privacy,0
Best Music Streaming Service. Period,1
Good,1
"Brilliant service when it works. But the most basic things are still not working. Why do downloaded podcasts not play when in offline mode? The only suggested solutions are reinstall the app and redownload everything. This isn't an option when you're traveling and without data or WiFi, which is the specific reason why I downloaded all of the podcast episodes in the first place. Not good enough for a premium service.",0
"I do not know what happen, but the app doesnt show the player bar inside the app, so it is impossible stop or pause the songs. How can I fix this??",0
Podcast still not available,0
The 'What's playing' facility has disappeared. The most basic feature - gone. Not good enough.,0
There is nothing wrong with this app I can listen to music when I want whenever.,1
"The ""songs for right now"" playlists are amazing!! Please keep these forever",1
App is giving problem..I cannot pause or next the song..i have to force stop the app and then start again..it's hanging,0
Worked well initially but recently the app stops playing at sudden moments when in the background and then randomly resumes again. It happens like several times during a single song.,0
I was never one to have a music collection. I do now and listen every day. Cheers Spotify,1
The sudden crashes would happen everyday that it's getting annoying,0
Nice,1
Spotify please can you have a chat feature??? hshshhs i wanna that!!! ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”,0
Music lover all my life and now I can still hear the songs of my childhood and youth,1
You have to listen to a minute of advertisements basically every 2 songs. I'm done with this app,0
I gave 2 stars on this app because on the update that it makes me harder to listen music everytime i search and play my fav. Song another song will play i hope that the shuffle thing will be fix its really hard to listen music.,0
Show all the songs from an artiste on their page. How difficult can that be? Create a light theme option. Some people don't like the dark theme. I don't...,0
overall great..not many ads...dislike trying to play a single artist...app always includes others in playlists,1
Autoplay feature not working anymore. It's not working also on the Amazon Echo dot either.,0
Offline experience is pretty unreliable. Use Audible if you want content offline.,0
Deleting from all devices. Public health is neither an issue of free speech or politics. Least of all profit.,0
Excellent App.I feel very happy to listen the songs through this App.,1
"Nice app for listening music especially throwback, lovely",1
"Good app, however, every time i want to add a specific song to my playlist, it shows me recommend songs rather than the song i want to look at and add. Edit: now, when ever i try to look at a new song or playlist, it gives me infinite adds. Wost music app ever. Uninstall and move to youtube people.",1
After a while it's going to make you and I mean make you by premium it won't even let you listen to your songs that you want to it's going to make it shuffle and that's annoying I want to listen to klees theme song God don't download this,0
"The apps keeps crashing for some reason. Also account got data breached last time, talk about broken security.",0
"I'm always able to find whatever song I want at the moment, no matter how obscure, and Spotify makes it really easy to build my own playlist.",1
"I'm glad the pause button got changed back to where it was before. However, I've been trying to do this new super grouper thing, it glitches out when you search for an artist and no names come up (my internet has full bars so it's not that). I clicked off it to retry it a few times but it's completely disappeared now. So I have no way of taking part now. I love Spotify but at the moment I'm giving it 3 stars because every update has something buggy in it.",0
"Good selection of music and podcasts, but it is not very intuitive to use. And why is the maximum time for the sleep timer 1hr?",0
Awesome ,1
While your app doesn't always work like its supposed to. I must applaud Spotify for being morally upstanding and doing the right thing where platforms with Tube and Book in their name have abandoned all reason and promote toxic ideology. Keep being you Spotify!,0
You can remember the songs from the lyrics that are written. Such a great app of songs.,1
It's nice and clear sound. Of course your internet speed should be supported as well.,1
Poor service and horrible music discovery.,0
Excellent so far,1
Problems on S10+ with widgets not working at all,0
"Super app, great collection of music",1
Can't preveiw songs before you add them to your playlist,0
This app is the best way to listen to music,1
Good songs. Plays well. Repeats same ads back to back... not paying for premium so i expect ads not the same one over and over and over.,0
"AMAZING Music Application,I've been with Spotify premium for a while now!. A helluva ðŸï¸ðŸï¸Ride !ðŸï¸ðŸï¸. And love the service it's provided!ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Žâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸ Edit: sorry for the low rating. I haven't updated this in years ! STILL A HELLUVA RIDE!!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Love this service till the end of my life!ðŸƒðŸŒ¿",1
"is there an option to choose what podcast I listen to on my daily drive? Also your algorithm for randomizing a playlist sucks. I get the same 10 songs no matter what out of 10,000 saved like songs I only get to hear the same 20 over and over. .?. Why does Spotify choose what I listen to in my daily drive they have me listen to fashion and some journalism s*** I would never f****** listen to and I can't change it.",0
It is easy to use and very useful.,1
"Spotify is an amazing app. Whenever I want to listen to music/ podcasts, Spotify has everything.",1
We enjoyed  feel satisfied with songs,1
"Terrible. From ads in a premium service and poor support for music makers, to supporting COVID misinformation. Spotify is a greedy abomination. There are much better music streaming services out there. This isn't one of them.",0
Spotify keeps corrupting and either not working outright or you go to play a song and it freezes and doesn't play. The latest update was garbage. Good luck to anyone installing it now.,0
Love Spotify! I'm switching Sorry YouTube music..,0
"I keep losing the currently playing bar at the bottom of the screen so I can not adjust the existing playlist. I have to completely close the app, relaunch and then it appears ðŸ˜­",0
"Everyday. I use this everyday. One feature I would love to see is basic chat capabilities between followers. Only text and links from within the app, for easy sharing of music between followers.",1
"It drains battery and you can't close out the song, merely pause it in the background. It was annoying and I didn't use it much because of that. Yet the whole Neil Young thing? Went from hardly using this buggy software to just uninstalling it.",0
"I always appreciate the app, but why after a certain number of liked songs played in shuffle I listen to some songs I don't have in my playlists and that aren't of a genre I listen to?",0
Can you make it easier to move multiple songs from to playlist to playlist Please!,1
Great app. Minimal adds and good programming. I like the playlist made for me . like you know what i like already. Weird,1
10 times better than Pandora and YouTube combined I love Spotify,1
Never have problems except one time when recently my wife and I got booted from being able to listen simultaneously to only one person at a time for some reason,1
"Great sound quality, economize my battery, got all my music choices, enjoy listening to podcasts on Spotify. You are good",1
"3 years ago my review was 5 stars, 1 year back it came to 3 and today it's a 1 star. The app experience was something spotify was known for, the smooth experience and playback. Now, it's just a garbage app with random shut downs and randomly stopping playback. The music player is not shown in the app and appears only sometimes. The app takes too long to launch even though I have a flagship android. Please fix your mess Spotify, I don't know why the app performs so poorly nowadays.",0
We were able to keep all our playlists when we changed phones and resubscribed with Spotify. It was a real bonus. We love the amount of music geared toward those easy listening and hip hop that we enjoy. Thank you very much for the good work!!! We are satisfied and happy to continue with Spotify.,1
Always detected as offline,0
I love spotify!!! All my fav music at my fingertips!,1
"Starting to force close often (Google Pixel 3aXL) stops playing at random. Please get it fixed soon or I'm out! It's worked great over the years, slight decline over the last six months.",0
It's ok. I hate how I have to get premium to have infinite skips and no ads. Ads I can live with. But getting it like two or three songs later is really annoying,0
"This app used to be so much better when I first got it the ad's weren't bad. I got it because I didn't want to pay money but recently the ad's have gotten really bad, it was the worst today, I changed the playlist I was listening to and got 13 ad's idk what the problem is.",0
"I like using the music in this but it always says "" nothing playing "" and it just scares me a little... I don't like it can you change that??? Ty <3",0
I just wish for better sound quality and a light mode option,0
"one of my favorite apps, it's great to find new songs, but I have a complaint: when we want to add songs to a playlist, we can't listen to the extracts of the songs anymore and that's annoying because we can't find new songs that way now. could you please enable us to listen to the songs extracts when we click on ""add new songs""?",0
"Extremely pleasant experience.I can find any song, artist..very nice.",1
It is a great app love it it has a lot of great playlists,1
They have horrible podcasts and lost a rock icon. I switched to YouTube music.,0
Randomly disconnect from my xbox when I'm pairing them and I can't pair it again after a couple days. Doesn't let me remote the songs from my phone to my xbox.,0
Literally everything is premium like,1
This is great. I cannow lision to my fav songs but adds come sometime only if you get the prime only you can lision it offline and not get adds ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,0
"Could be better via lyrics search. In the search box there could be a search lyrics. I spend my time going out of app and into google search and back into app. A pain especially at the start. Also when u listen to someones playlist be cool if there was a function to ""dislike/not like a song"" like there is in other sections, just so u dont have to go over the same song a few times. Otherwise very good. Since update on 5 April there is no pause or stop button so I can't stop the music playing!!",0
Every time I make a playlist is to losten to certain songs not the ones they add.,0
Really good collection and suggestions ðŸ‘ Edit- I choose and play a song but in reality it plays something else. Definitely an issue with app. I do not face any such issue on other music apps...,0
"Completely useless app, recently has been completely broken / unusable and will not load anything at all even though all my playlists and stuff are still there. Don't even bother get another streaming service don't waste your time.",0
The mobile experience is 6 stars,1
Not able to login after the new update even after trying all the methods,0
"I've paid for premium, for a pretty long time already. Worked great. Just today it started crashing. Can't listen to a full album, plays six songs crashes, then I have to open the app all over again and press play.",0
Very good everything I ever wanted to listen to,1
I love Spotify. I get to listen to new music and create my own playlists. It's a great experience overall. Only downside is the glitches and when they removed preview for songs.,0
Stupid app that adds songs you didn't want to your playlists and when you ADD OR REMOVE ANY OF YOUR SONGS THEY ADD EVEN MORE HOLY GOD THE PERSON THAT MADE THAT SHOULD BE FIRED,0
"Spotify with premium is the best thing, but without premium it is painâ˜ºï¸",0
"Update made on 5Apr2022 seems buggy. It always hangs, and when I re-open the App, it will not show the current song bottom banner. Hope this gets fixed.",0
"Dear Spotify, I have cancelled my subscription and you kept debiting me . This is unfair",0
"Works most of the time, but the iPhone app is so much more better",1
"Best app for music and new discoveries. The a.i. recommendations to similar artists/albums, is second to none, a must though is membership. But worth every penny if you are a fellow music fan. Would give 100 stars if I could; spotify has re-ignited my passion in listening to good, new (and old) music.",1
"Spotify is a nice app and I like it very much but all of a sudden the songs in my playlist aren't visible and there are only names of the songs. I can't order the songs in the way that I want and I can't see what song is next. I deleted Spotify and installed it again but it didn't work, I also cleared chache but that still did nothing.",0
Playlists are broken. Music constantly skips. Search just doesn't work. This used to be my favorite app. Now I'm getting a subscription to YouTube music.,0
"The bloody autoplay feature just won't stop! It keeps playing random songs I don't like and didn't even added to the Playlist despite disabling it in the settings. After playing those annoying songs, ads roll in that lasts for like a minute or so. Instead of putting me in a good mood, it did the exact opposite. Don't use this app unless you have the budget for premium subscription. LISTENING MUSIC ON YOUTUBE IS WAY BETTER THAN AN APP LITERALLY CREATED FOR LISTENING MUSIC.",0
"So you're telling me i can't listen to playlist's songs in a row?? There's a preview option given, for what exactly? I'll have to shuffle music in order to listen to a certain playlist. What if i want to listen to a particular song of that playlist? Why are you guys making Spotify experience bitter for me. The recent update is terrible. I'm a huge music fan, let the app experience be handy.",0
The latest update is clearly awful...,0
Please add remix songs and mashups as well,1
it was all good upto those premium ads,1
Love this app. Its an incredible way of discovering new music and the frankly ridiculous amount of content is reason enough to subscribe.,1
nice,1
The ad experience is horrific and if I make a playlist containing 20 or so songs I'm lucky if I get to hear a single 1 from it I used use this app exclusively and now its unbearable,0
This is amazing. Im listening to it right now on my xbox while on discord! (That made no sense) And i love the app so much! I listen to it like 24/7 because Its so goooood like SHEEESH,1
The new update is broken. I have to constantly close and reopen the app to refresh it. It won't show what current song is playing. It's very glitchy and slow. It has worked perfectly before,0
Why is it so hard to remove a song from your play lists?,0
Literally I put in all my info correct and they say invalid email. Like what?! I'm also getting 3 ads in a row.,0
The app has been VERY glitchy the last 2 days. A developer needs to look at it.,0
Been using premium for just a few months and I am very happy with my purchase and I have the duo account me and my friend enjoy sharing our playlist would recommend to any music lover,1
I been using Spotify for about three years and up onto recently it won't give me previews for songs or and it keeps skipping at random times,0
I listen to Spotify everyday and its great. The only problem I have is not being able to use my Spotify Premium with another person.,0
"For the past few months, my Spotify has been lagging. I don't know what it is, but I'll open the app a d try to play music, then my phone screen freezes. I've restarted my phone multiple times to fix it but it always messed up. Please help me fix it already.",0
"Worst app for music,so many ads.",0
"Love almost everything about it except one huge issue. I have spotify premium and had it for many many years now. This past year its been having issues like: -app not functioning (black screen) -music will randomly just glitch and stop playing for a second or two -often i use the feautured offline mode on premium membership but its 90% of the time glitching and not working, or taking a very long time to work Solutions: patience, because i tried deleting my app and cache, redownloading.Nothing",0
Spotify is a good app you can listen to music whenever you play games or you can listen to podcasts when you play and you don't necessarily have to be playing games you can just listen to it I think that it shouldn't have as much updates as it does so maybe fix that but everything else is great yeah I would say everything is pretty good I don't think you need to fix anything else maybe make hours of songs like one of my favorites is stitches so maybe make it on repeat and do that to other songs,1
Used to be a good app until I couldn't play a song individually and when I added songs to a playlist it adds even more songs and I can't even loop songs anymore. Bring back all those features and make this app great again,1
I can't figure out how to download single songs instead of the whole album! If there is a way can someone share how to do it?,0
Great app. Would like to be able to turn off car mode so on road trips i can watch podcast as a passenger.,0
One of the best. App for music no one beat SPOTIFY,1
Makes a nice change to radio,1
Tooooooooo many ads,0
The play bar is now intermittently disappearing from the bottom with no option to control the music without force stopping the app. This occurs multiple times per day and must be an issue with the latest update. PLEASE FIX!!,0
This is the best music app I have ever downloaded. It's really easy to use and even without premium this app is still amazing. I also really like this app because I can definitely tell that they care a lot about their listeners. At the end of the year they do a little collage of your most listened to songs and artists which I thought was really cute and they also made a couple of playlists based off of your most played artists and songs. I'm very satisfied.,1
I love to hear Ads ðŸ˜Œâ¤its so SATISFYING.... But Sometimes musics play and INTERRUPT the Ads ðŸ˜”....i request to Fixed this Problem.... So i enjoy ads Peacefully.... Great AppðŸ™ðŸ˜Š,1
I have downloaded this app about three times now and I can just log in or sign up..it keeps telling me am offline or try again even though I have strong network connection... This is not good at all,0
A cutting edge approach to giving the Public the Types of Music that is requested!,1
"THIS IS A GOOD APP ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKES MUSIC !! (man i can't really function well without spotify honestly) The only problem is, why can't I subscribe to a premium plan using smart courier? As a student, that's the only way I can pay for premium. It only says ""oops, something went wrong, please try again."" which happened to me lots of times. The GETPIN method used to work really well but now I can't get a pin. What to do? Or are you able to fix this? :(",0
"Generally a good app, but recent update was super buggy (no ""playing now"" section, music pauses for few sec every minute or so), and no ""backward patch"" was released despite the fact that it was released 2 weeks ago",0
"While one can get good quality music for free, it contains a great amount of disruptive ads that just won't stop. Overall this app is only good if one has a premium package.",1
The app was working great until the latest update. Now the now playing bar doesn't always appear at the bottom of the screen. Please fix this!,0
"I dont like the new update :/ I cant freagin hear the songs i had in my playlist- instead i listen to random songs that ""They added"" smh...",0
"Different types, choices and brills.",0
"The app requires premium to be free of ads, and it also requires premium to play a song you choose without it being in a playlist.",0
not 5 stars cause its a pain to not be able to select your music in the phone unless you are premium and this refreins so much to reach further people but besides that its awesome,1
"Really need to make the ""start radio"" button less tucked away. Also need Jack up recommendations. This app is alright.",1
Every time I download Spotify it deleted it in a day or so but great app,1
"Nov 2021 update screwed everything up. What you want while driving is small buttons, distrating cover art and lyrics, makes driving more dangerous. They remove the best thing, android car view and keep screen on, so constantly unlocking your phone is dangerous. You can no longer safely skip songs while driving. Buttons are so tiny and unresponsive 0 stars. Update 6 months and many update later. UI still bad while driving",0
Rating one star because you can skip only 6 songs per hour ' they r getting bad day by day,0
"I had a great experience with Spotify for a few years. Now, with the newer updates, it crashes all the time midway through a song. I've tried everything to get the app to work properly. It's very frustrating. I'm thinking of switching music players - and according to the other reviews, so are others.",0
"Awesome app when it works, and usually does when you have a solid Internet connection, but if you don't, it's horrible, even with music saved to my device, I can't cha get anything without an internet connection, and when I try, it stops, it's silent and doesn't play any music till I have a stable internet connection. My advice, start what you want to listen to playing before you leave your internet connection.",0
"Lots of add, needs premium to disable ads, PTL(Pay to listen)",0
"Day by day i am additected to this app . I have been using this app from 4 mounths and i can't really imagine how much i got involved with this app .. whenever i fell bore or when i make a journey with any kinds of transportation, i love to hear SPOTIFY. I can't ignore this app... Lots of Love from Bangladesh..ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©",0
Very nice app for listening songs ðŸ‘ðŸ˜,1
GOOD,1
1/ stop breaking your app 2/ YouTube premium has better music recommendations; spotify radio is useless.,0
My Spotify's experience is so much satisfying and incredibly amazing as well,1
Use to be better. Lots of ads & will stop playing for no reason.,0
Bring desktop version features on mobile version too,0
really good app. i use it everyday. only problems i have are the amount of ads before a song plays and that the color of your profile picture doesn't make the background that color like it does with the playlists edit: i would really like if you could write a note about a song in a playlist,0
"Newest update is terrible. Sound just cuts out and needs to be restarted manually. Also, no way (or not an easy way) to get to episode to restart or rewind.",0
"I get 3 ads, then 1 song plays, then I listen to 3 ads. Not worth it, I hear more about nonsense than the actual music I use the app to listen to. Also it never saves my playlists.",0
I have a suggestion that other language songs should have english subs ... Like we can change the languages I will be helpful,0
"Lol, it's an amazing app. It's so great that I can pay just for one time for one month, and renew it again when I want to when I have money to.. it really is a good thing for students who aren't earning, who depend on their parents' money...",1
Very nice music app like it,1
I started going here when slacker & pandora were having technical difficulties + I also go here for a new favorite of podcasts.,1
love this app. <3 but sadly in andriod you cant pick the songs you wanna play but in iphone or ipad you cant :'),0
Good,1
Apk mod doesn't work anymore i guess I'll pay to Spotify again:(,0
Other than ads all is okay,1
I love Spotify. The car app is super easy and how it connects to my Waze. Thanks,1
"10 years ago this app was the best for music! Now its dead last!! So sad. Can't pick a song, rewind or go back, the playlists/stations SUCK, interface is all over the place, and worst of all it continues to play in the background unless you go into app settings and force stop. I won't even have the app on and it'll just start playing music. It has no permissions so idk how its possible for it to nonstop run in the background. I came back from Amazon music to see if its better, HARD PASS",0
Love it no comercials,0
Simple to use and it is clean unlike the other music apps . ðŸ‘â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸,1
"As a life long music buff, I love being able to access almost any music from blues to clasical from any decade. Its also great to be able to put together a favorite song list very easily.",1
I have given it 5 start because I love it and I recommend that those who love to hear music no matter what language u listen u can then download Spotify because it's made for u only music lovers.....,1
Excellent songs to change the moods,1
"Sound quality is good but only one but a very irritating con: The ads just dont close! I can't even go back to the search bar or even to my playlist because that ad is just stuck on the screen! I literally have to restart spotify so as to close the ad and after a while , the same thing happens again!! fix this otherwise i will unistall this..",0
Phone app really needs a multiple choice option where we can choose multiple songs and add to a playlist.,0
It gives Quality Music but why 3 ads after every 3-4 songs!!,0
"I have been unable to access the app on my phone for over a week, even after numerous updates that could not resolve the problem! Very disappointing. After trying to uninstall and reinstall the app to fix the problem, I have discovered that it cannot be uninstalled and it caused all my playlists on my other music app to be deleted! I am now furious and looking to switch before the end of next week.",0
"i really enjoy Spotify music it keeps my spirit up on a daily basis,",1
Awesome music but could have been better like YouTube music,0
Loved it. And really appreciate the hard work of all members of Spotify team for creating such a wonderful app. Thank You.,1
Very very good app for podcasts listeners and music lovers,1
"Every platform needs to have better policies that prevent misinformation about critical topics like health-related information. It's a slap in the face to the many who have died as a result or have seen families die. Spotify is complicit in perpetuating misinformation and that doesn't make me feel comfortable as a customer. For anyone who doesn't care, go for it, but it's not worth it for me. Plus, it's too pricy now. I have a cheaper membership now on a different platform and I'm happy with it",0
"normally I love Spotify but since the new update it's been so hard to use & its kinda dumb, i dont have premium & b4 the update it was fine but now its just annoying to bc it now plays an ad after every single song most of the time, u can't preview the songs anymore before adding them to a playlist anymore, when add from liked songs it still shows the song u added until u add another from liked & then it happens again. its gotten so annoying that i just got a walkman to use instead",0
"Except for the frequent invasive ads, Spotify is a great tool for checking out new music before I decide to go out and buy a CD. Old music as well!!",0
Whose idea was it to move the play/pause button from the middle? Worst design change ever!,0
...Spotify is my favorite Music App!!...love making my own playlists!!...,1
"Possiblity the worst user experience ever. If like me you are a random dipper and want to listen to an album/single from your past and not interested in making playlists etc then preserve your sanity and find another method. I normally want to listen to music to relax in the short perios of time I get free, unfortunately this is typically a failure using the mobile app, which ends up in stress and disappointment",0
Well i dont have a prob is that when i try to listen to music it gives me 1 or 2 ads and then says i have 30min of no ad but only last 10min and also now it gives me 8 or 9 ads,0
"Absolutely amazing app, can't complain.",1
"Enjoying the app, love that I can download my playlist and podcast episodes; however, on the topic of podcasts, I would love if there was an option to automatically download new episodes and remove previous played episodes. I'm not a fan of episodes getting exclude on the unplayed sorting feature when I haven't fully played them",0
I love it soo ðŸ˜ðŸ’•much it feel very relief when you ðŸ˜Œlisten music But only problem is the adds,0
"Amezing app for song lovers, you are enjoying to listening the song with the lyrics",1
"This app has an abundant selection of music and podcasts to choose from. Easy to use, it is great for those that aren't technically inclined. I would highly recommend this app.",1
It's okay kinda laggy sometimes,0
Great app Loving it all day,1
"It drops in and out when it wants, either to my car or earbubs and cones back, although it still shows as playing with the timer counting down Nd then after a couple of minutes comes back all of a sudden with wherever the timer Is up to normally a new song. And half the time I don't get the control bar ribbon across the bottom. Glitchy to say the least and expensive for the trouble it causes.",0
Music is always on in our house. Great variety.,1
My favorite app for music. I really love how you can create your very own playlists based on your tastes. When I add the songs to these playlists I add ones that are related to the playlists that I created.,1
Ever since the update I have been having issues with Spotify and Android Auto. No matter what I do Spotify plays through my phone speaker and not through my vehicle when connected to Android Auto. Fix this now! I'm about to cancel my premium service,0
I wish I had premium but otherwise great experience,1
"Love the music on here, but it has some problems. I'll click skip once, and it'll keep scrolling through songs. Or sometimes it won't play songs at all, but it says it does.",1
Clear and smooth will rate better when I used it for a month,0
What's the persistent notification that can't be swiped away anymore for? This used to be something I could remove when I am done listening. Stop spamming my notification area!,0
"Enjoy the next 30 minutes free from advertising.. song..ad.ad.ad.ad.song.ad.ad.song.song.ad..... I was a pior premium user, but due to excessive bugs and podcast issues have chosen to discontinue paying for a premium account and will probably find a alternative service.",0
BEST ONE,1
It's not that bad it has all my songs but I hate the new updates I can't scroll through my playlist again and if I can it's to hard to find,0
"so im giving it 2 star because the new thing where you only get 6 skips per hour and can't go back is just annoying me so much like why please revert it back i don't like this at all i cant even afford premium, just please fix this i don't like this :/",0
Has all the songs and bands I listen too...,1
"We have a family plan. Our credit card was compromised & we forgot that it was our payment method on Spotify. My teens & hubs all got ahold of me because they couldn't use Spotify one day. I was extremely busy and decided I'd deal with it later. When I got in my truck to head home & couldn't stream. I had to resort to the radio on my way home. BOY THAT SUCKED!! Once you can play whatever you want, whenever you want & hear new music of any genre, you will never go back! SPOTIFY IS AMAZING!!",1
"I have a xiaomi redmi note 10 pro and lyrics on the app don t show no matter what. did a clean reinstall according to their article, changed my phone s language to english, googled many many times for at least half a year. I am paying for spotify premium but honestly, not having lyrics on mobile and not having a sleep timer on pc are kind of dealbreakers, and I am open to move to another music app and not pay money for an ""indie company"" with missing/broken features for such a long time.",0
Downloads always seem to disappear when I need them,0
Nice,1
It literally shuffles songs when I don't want it to and I can't even listen to the songs I want anymore And you can't even skip the ads and when I tap on the song I want it just shows a preview instead,0
"What happened to the app?, i can't play the songs i want to play and it keeps shuffling to a different song.",0
I know a lot of apps do this now. But Spotify happens to be the one that did it recently. it's really really annoying to have my phone go off every single day when Spotify failed to get payment.,0
I Love the songs. The app is totally good,1
"Love the variety of songs, lots of faves and reminiscing!!",1
Awful worked for first few weeks now it only plays 20 seconds of a song from my playlist and stops I've cleared cache uninstalled it etc nothing works time to move on,0
"When I want to play the song Play the song Not anything else No suggestions, no 5 minutes of ads, nothing else but the song",0
"Good app overall! My only grind is they say 30mins of playback after an ad, but in actuality about 2ads pop up every 15mins.",0
Great connection good music great experience,1
I love Spotify. Every song I wish to listen to is there. Great app,1
It is good We can listen all kind of songs but the main problem is the ads which makes me angry ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
JRE a very good podcast. Love the ability to listen to old shows too.,1
Satisfying and entertaining and also a relaxing school of learning.,1
Nice app for listening songs but only disturbing is ads just 5to 7 songs Ad will come and next number songs playing this is the thing in the app is small disturb but the app is so good to use in traveling,1
"Paid subscription is best out there! They have everything and Playlist management is simple and user-friendly. Easy to put a long compilation Playlist on random play so it's like having (in my case) 47 hours of random music on a radio station, except they are all songs I like! Anyhow, impressive.",0
"Every day with Spotify, is the best way to listen to my favorite tunes!",1
App stopped bugging out so yay! :),1
"Everytime an ads wants to play, the next episode starts playing. The navigation of the app is sub par.",0
Great music streaming app! ðŸ¤™,1
Since the update the app frequently pauses what I'm listening to every 5-20 mins. Also in the app the playing bar at the bottom is gone and I'm unable to choose to pause what I'm listening to unless app just does it randomly as i said above.,0
Awesome but we can set any song as caller tune ðŸ˜‚,0
I really like it. But I want to have the option to turn on recommended songs.,1
Excellent Music App,1
"This is the best music I've come across ever since. I just have one problem with. If I ever sign out, when I log in again I find all my downloads gone and i have to download all the songs again. Anyway besides that, this is the best streaming app for everyone. Y'all gotta check it out",1
"If I had words to explain i wish I had more than 500 characters to describe how I feel about this app. Music is my life and I want to make Spotify 100% most used app of my 2022. Every update keeps getting better, and getting more and more music thats not out there. Great app",0
"I don't know if y'all would answer the solution for this, but I've been utilizing this music source for nearly 2 years now, had enjoyed every single thing until the last update. Firstly, lot of songs I've played recently depicted a whole different track or album's cover, which made me hard to distinguish what song is. Secondly, specifically lastly, why do some songs have a lag, even if I've downloaded it? I've never experienced this before. Please fix this immediately.",0
"Very easy to use. Spotify makes Playlists suited to your music tastes, mood, occasions, activities, etc. Ads are infrequent and short. I highly recommend this app!",1
Obviously Spotify is the best music app but 5 stars don't mean it's flawless. My main issue rn is that initially the updates are often buggy to the point where I can't use the app properly and I have to go download an old apk.. Please do better,0
"Overall, this app is great. I like the option of being able to listen to podcasts as well. But spotify, please work on your shuffle of songs! I have 747 songs and I swear I hear the same 10 songs in a row.",1
"I really liked this app, but when the update came I can't even play my Favorite music is it just my WiFi slow or this app is the problem?, Please fix this app Immediately. :((",0
"I used to love this app, so much so I'm paying for a premium family plan. But it works horribly now and may look for a different music streaming app. I listen to music all day and get annoyed when it doesn't work. Random pausing, navigation bar disappears, and it's down right terrible while used on smart TV, USB in the car and just listening with headphones. 2 stars because I like the group sessions. Please fix",0
I still love it in 2022 can't live without my Spotify,1
Best music app with social sharing features,1
"The BEST music streaming service. The UX is on point. I tried Apple music and Deezer, and always keep coming back.",1
"Been using for a long time now, like 8 years or something like that. I have no complaints, there are reasons why it's one of the most popular music streaming services.",1
"Spotify is showing ""no internet connection"" for months now. And I have tried everything but it still shows that. I talked to your operator but they don't reply. Worst customer service. Always leave you hanging.",0
Good app,1
"I put the settings as download songs through WiFi only, however the app download the songs on very high settings using my 4G data, please fix.",0
"Good. Listening is clear ,and continues.",1
"I can't log in. I tried logging in with Google. I'm told I already have an account. My password doesn't work. I try logging in without a password. I'm told I don't have an account. Stuck in a log in loop. No, I won't ""just use a different email address"". Uninstalled.",0
"It doesnt let me hear more than 5 sec of a song on my phone, but on my pc yes..... I Uninstaller, cleared cache , restarted my phone like 5 times and nothing",0
"I'm having the same lagging issue as others. Ive tried everything I can think of, reinstalling the app and booting everything, nothing helps. It's extremely frustrating considering I pay for premium and can barely use the app.",0
The app is glitching few times a day. I am paying for what? Lmao,0
I love the music options and dont mind the ads would give this app a 5 star but sometimes when im listening to music and it would turn it self off in the middle of a match or a tournament and restarts the music and pauses it forcing me out of my game just to turn it on again then when it switches to another music it stop again just annoying and would like to play my games with music on helps me relax be sides that its a good app,0
Always stop functioning in back ground,0
A platform that actually does support full free speach and my number one favorite app for music/podcasts. Spotify is one of the only platforms that knows that more content and speach is always better. Spotify has nearly anything on the app. I've had it for at least 5 years now. Highly recommend.,1
App crashing just as I try to play some music :(. Other than that when it doesn't its a great app for music,0
"Great for listening to high quality music at a reasonable price, had an issue with the lyrics feature but was soon fixed by support.",0
Great selection of music to keep everyone entertained,1
"I don't what is going on, the past couple of days it's been bugging out. Songs will skip, pause, not play. The play or pause button will be stuck.",0
The hell with chand baliyan song i am fed up of that ad after every single song ends please do something it interupts a lot. Please look forward to it . . . . Hopping for you to look onto this irritated ad I'm beginning please,1
I like this app because Songs I want can found quickly and more helpful for me,1
"Probably my most used app, but it is super buggy on my Pixel 5. The play controls disappear while media is playing and I have to force stop and reopen the app regularly. Tried a fresh install multiple times.",0
"Spotify use to be a 5 star app, adding lyrics was a great addition, and they have a lot of social media influence. However all the other major streaming apps have some type of high-res streaming subscription offer. Why is Spotify so far behind in this!? Artists spend lots of time creating intricate details in music through Dolby Atmos, and Spotify doesn't even give us a chance to stream it that way. Saying they're working on it while other companies have already rolled it out. Let's catch up",0
There is very good musics and we learn also lyrics.And i feel so Peace.And there is good song for broken hearted,1
I love how even if your phone is off you can still listen to your playlist ect if I could give this 100 stars I would!,1
App activates on its own...even after I force stop it.,1
New update is terrible! Music bar isnt showing on the bottom.. music keeps playing when i open music on otther apps. The pause/play and forward button does not show on the top of my drop down bar of my phone.. this should not happen on a paying app,0
Some songs are not available,0
Smaller footprint than some competitors,0
It's a good app but it won't allow me to listen to anything no matter much I try I can't listen to my my fav songs for no reason,0
"Ever since the most recent update it keeps playing music without the play bar, crashing and continuing to play music. (Galaxy S20)",1
best streaming music app,1
"Well well well , spotify does the right thing and keeps Joe Rogan, i am impressed so i bought premium.",1
Why isn't my like songs playlist working??? It's not opening no matter how many times I try.... Please fix it...,0
My experience was the best it felt like I was in real life concert when I was just hitting in my bed I played it why I was on my video game and why I was doing other things I love the sounds and the music that they display please download it immediately it's the best thing I've ever thought of downloading I don't use no other apps except for this to listen to music download it now it's the best,1
"Very interesting! great format , real lovely",1
Bravo,1
Never had any problems works great,1
Has started randomly skipping a TON during playback in this latest version. It runs so poorly now. Huge waits to get through the interface and weird inscrutable bugs. I wonder if they test their software or if they just spit out changes whenever they feel like it. (Even their update notes are a snub to the user.),0
"absolute garbage, it was good before they made shuffle and ads after every song a requirement, on pc its fine but on mobile it very different. At this point I can write a 200 word essay on how much it sucks on mobile",0
I love it it's the best music app I've seen so far the only thing I wish it did I wish you could like click on a song and move it to a different position other than that I love it!!!,1
"My spotify hasn't worked in a week. I unloaded it,reload it uninstalled it three times and it doesn't work.",0
I love it you get to listen to your fav song anytime,1
Too many ads,0
Pay for this app its worth it UNLESS you dont like non-stop music and commercials are your jam,1
Good sound and song experience,1
"Its an okay app, But whenever i try to add a song to my playlist the app crashes. Spotify is a good app aside from this problem, Please fix this glitch. Thank you!",1
I can't even listen to my playlists Spotify is one of the worst mobile song streaming platforms right now you're making me listen to songs that you put in can't even listen to my playlists.,0
"Can spend all day listening to my favorite artists,and songs with such ease.",1
It was good and higher but then they stopped letting me listen to the thing for the recommended song and that's how I get more songs so that sucked,0
Awesome product for listening but I am experiencing some bugs.,0
Just had to uninstall. After the update a few days back the app became almost impossible to use. Nothing works as it should. Hopefully Spotify fix it with another update soon. I'm not going to reinstall and use it until they do!,0
I will always support Apps which protect Free Speech!! I may not agree with what you say...I will ALWAYS support your RIGHT to say it!!!,0
We still can't see who follows our playlists. They still don't consider bringing this feature. No one knows why,0
"Great music app. The ads can be bothersome but premium settles that issue. Great catalog of artists and podcasts. Also great that I can use it on my PS4, pc and phone.",1
This is best app for song but ads are very much,1
"We have been continuously reaching your team regarding a concern but you teams aren't responding anywhere! Twitter, INSTGRAM nowhere!! The artist ""LISA"" account was hacked and another artist is getting her streams but after so many complaints and emails there's no response and help!!!",0
"Just better all around compared to other popular music apps, BY FAR!!! XOXO",1
"I've discovered so many new music through Spotify and its my go to when sharing music with friends, but lately it's been so annoying when I want to play a different song and it just won't. My app is up to date on updates, it's not a space issue because my phone has plenty of space left, please fix this issue Spotify. Leaning towards canceling my subscription and paying for YouTube if this won't resolve.",0
"It's an overall great app, there isn't much to say how amazing it is but I HIGHLY recommend it! I fell in love with it as soon as I started using it. Great app! ðŸ‘",1
Why does the songs cut in and out? I just noticed for the past few weeks Spotify has been acting strange. Super annoying! ðŸ‘Œ please fix ;).,0
Very user friendly app,1
I love how i can play all my fav song and make a playlist of my fav song or my best friends fav song...5 star I really recomend you to get spotify.(Spotify is the B E S T BEST!!!),1
No one would like spotify. Streaming quality is superior.,0
"It's nice, but there are too many things to pay for",0
Works well easy to use.,1
love Spotify so much,1
it's difficult to understand at times but the desktop version is fire and it just puts random songs instead of the song you want to play,0
Amazing app.. I love this app.. and this app is far much better than any another music apps....,1
Alll time adds he adds nd ya monthly package karwany Ap sa request ha sound cloud app download karay Whoo perfect ha,1
Best music in town. Driving mode can be tweeky,1
I want to love this app but music discovery isn't close to being as good as on Pandora and my 2019 Volkswagen Jetta keeps experiencing bugs with this app almost daily. It also has difficulty pairing with the car.,0
So i was playing a song and then there was a werid voice that is not in the song it sounded like a 10 year old and i was very confused lol but this app is really good even after that,1
"Not even deserve for 1 star. Seriously I can't listen to song on Spotify???? It's becoming so difficuot to use. User interface is not easy!. I can't listen to songs, and what is this six skips per minute??? But on PC it going good???? . Plz change this. Your ratings are going down! Sorry To say @Soundcloud is much better and easy to use",0
Search bar is cut off by top notification bar on pixel 4a 5g. Preview of current song also not populating in dropdown bar,0
"Updated review: I love Spotify! Such a wide variety of playlists and awesome recs are what I like the most. I'm using the app since it was launched in my country and I'm pretty happy with what I get. However, if there ever will be a possibility to add songs to ""play next"" and not just in queue, it'd be a 5â­ app for me.",1
"I'm paying, why do I have to skip advertising on podcasts?",0
"Love Spotify, but the app is trash. Constantly crashes.",0
Love it. Will always be a subscriber.,1
"This application is very good and flexible (everything knows). But I think that there is a problem, when I'm going to download the music after downloading I can't see the lyrics offline.",0
I love this app! Curated playlist to your tastes and constant recommended music to fit the perfect vibe.,1
"I won't give it 5 starts because I can't move the songs like to when it's pretty savage I can't do it, to the start PLEASE FIX THIS BUG",0
Recently when I play songs there is no option to view the song that is currently playing. Because of this I can't pause the song I'm currently playing without killing the app... As a premium subscriber this is infuriating. My notification tray of Spotify of the current song does not update and I can't click next or view the song or skip the song in the app or outside the app... Please fix this!,0
They have all you want songs artist and album are very much complete,1
Best thing to listen to your music on and no lies if you become like a member it is even better.,1
everything was good until the new update i cant even download my songs just because i wasn't on premium and i cant skip songs i can only skip 6 songs per hour,0
Can always count on Spotify to find accompaniment tracs!!!,0
11022024,1
Best app for songs ðŸ’œ,1
Not the ads but ok,1
The most wonderful app for music.... Jst love itðŸ˜˜,1
"Update: app is going from bad to worse. Regularly lose my playback controls, which can only be gotten back by force closing and restarting the app. Android Auto also has regular issues nowadays. App gathers more and more bugs over time. I'm thinking of switching to a competitor, being a premium user since 2010.",0
The Android app has a lot of issues with the queue for me - deleting and rearranging things. It's very frustrating but also the developers have been very helpful and responsive (albeit so far unsuccessful) trying to solve this. I wish Spotify as a company did more to limit the spread of false information and paid artists more fairly. Overall it is still the best music streaming service I've tried.,1
This app used to be good but now there's to many bugs and problems. I'm extremely close to canceling my premium membership and going to a different platform. Whoever is running this app is doing a terrible job.,0
"I found all the music I wanted, even what I thought was unfoundable",0
Way too many adds...get like 3 songs then 20 min of adds...boof,0
Great!!! Works Amazingly all the time Would definitely recommend,1
"Good app so far compared to the rest . Still getting use to it , it has all your collection",1
"A sides from some glitches with the app loosing your spot on podcasts, I really enjoy Spotify and the variety it has to offer.",1
App keep hanging up. It still plays but the controls disappear and you can't change songs. You have to close the App and reopen it.,0
"The best app ever,mostly while doing my runs,cycling ..",1
It is cool ,1
Updating my review to say the app still has a litany of problems and can't even display the correct song when connected via Bluetooth. Let alone play anything without freezing,0
I don't want your recommend songs. And why do we get 6 skips an hour! It's like so annoying. Worst ever.,0
All of a sudden all my liked songs are vanished from list for that I've spend lots of time to find and shortlisted them. I hope you will help me out to bring back my liked songs.,0
I keep having to download songs I already downloaded from a radio playlist. And when I go offline all the songs leave my library. And this has happened for over 3 times please fix this up.,0
"This app is so buggy when it comes to third party integrations - Android Auto, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa. By far the most frustrating app I use. Spotify is always the common denominator when it comes to my tech headaches.",0
Exceptional service. They always provide me with picks that I love but the adds are a bit inconvenient.,0
"Wow! Its so much better than last time I used it, was so frustrated and so long D-rawn out before i use to give Up and withdraw. Good work now, keep it up and improve even more! Well done Team!",1
Please add the ability to play your whole playlist and not have to shuffle to different songs and add the ability to play your whole playlist on Alexa devices through the Alex skill please thank you so much.,1
Can't get certain songs but overall this app is great,1
"I've been using premium for 1.5yrs now. It's great. Only issue is the app, whenever a new update rolls out I get new problems, such as: the app getting slow, not loading in or not connecting with my pc. All these problems I can fix by restarting the app but it gets tedious after 2 months on consistent problems.",0
"The pause button randomly disappears, as does the bar which allows you to toggle the shuffle play and repeat options off and it randomly cuts out. Android operating system is up to date. I've also had to do repeated soft shutdowns of my phone, (Frequently the only way to switch Spotify off), AND uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Nothing is fixing the problem. Guess I'll be returning to the free version.",0
Lately the app has been crashing as soon as I play A song If any solutions plz reply!,0
"I rlly love spotify but recently the ads are getting excessive, I was supposed to get ""30 minutes of ad free listening"" and got 3 ads after 1 song?? non premium users deserve more </3",0
"Awful, when I clicked on a song to play it played a different song and when I tried to skip through I was limited to 6 skips and the ads were really long and frequent even when it said I'd only get them every half hour. YouTube Music is sooo much better, none of these problems.",0
Just Fuc*ing remove ads please it really sucks for some students as their parents won't allow to pay online even after it'll be 80â‚¹. It really sucks,0
You can't play specific songs unless you pay. You can get free alternatives so don't shill for some big corporation - there are better ways to support smaller artists.,0
"They don't care about their Community. In their forum the most liked suggestion, since 2018, is a ""not interested"" button. People hate the fact that they're front page gets spammed with podcasts eventhough they will never listen to them or never had.",0
"29/03/21 Premium user. A few months ago it lost bluetooth controls, this week if I tell it to play an album via Android Auto it agrees with me then plays whatever it chooses. 16/09/21 Updated itself now cannot open at all. Great service. 22/01/22 Constant intermittent playback. No support on Google play, copied and pasted responses on Spotify forum where the only advice to every single issue is to reinstall. Worked flawlessly 3 years ago. Stop fiddling with it!",0
Why are you forcing me to continue premium when I want the free version. This is nonsense!!!!. I'm going to YouTube music,0
This is a great way to listen to music the only way I would like more that Spotify should add the fan number where the monthly listeners is underneath the monthly listeners count should be the fan count of the artists,1
"Great app ðŸ˜ƒâ— Spotify not only has all my favorite songs ðŸŽ¶, but all if the songs that I know ðŸ˜ƒâ—Spotify also does not lag at all ðŸª„â—",1
"Used it a couple times but I don't like the fact you only get limited skips, and you can't choose a song whenever you want. I use YouTube music now and its way better than this app. I would rather watch a 30 second ad then not choose my favorite song. Do you agree or disagree?",0
The only downside is they rotate songs in and out so one month you can listen to that great song next month maybe not.,0
"Unusable in the free version on mobile apps. This doesn't encourage you to upgrade. Select a track and it plays a completely unrelated track on an un-editable 'playlist'. It seems you can't select a song and then listen to it. Deleted, and I'm moving on. I give one star because there isn't a 'zero' star. Use the laptop version if you want the 'free' version, which at least allows you to select a track and then listen to it. I'm expecting that will be 'disabled' in time too.",0
"I have owned probably 6 different android phones the last 2 years and one thing remained the same. Spotify will not open when I choose to open it. How is an app that just plays music so difficult to open? Hoping the developers can answer, cause this is terrible. I'm sure other streaming services cannot be this bad. YouTube and WatchESPN both open faster. I have to restart my phone if I want to listen to music. This is just sad and I'm about to switch my longtime subscription to tidal or Amazon.",0
"After the recent updates, the app became worse than before.",0
I loved the old version of this app but the new one is not as good and I don't use it as much anymore I get that they need to put adds in but I want to be able to choose the song I listen to instead of having to listen to a random song I don't like that the app has added to my playlist,0
"App frequently glitches and crashes, and even paying for premium you get ads on podcasts.",0
"This app crashes regularly won't show what's playing when I open the app, will play after the apps been closed generally super buggy.",0
"I have been a premium user for years and have never experienced any problems until now... For some reason, probably technical, when you click on a song there is no information tab, meaning you cannot see what you are listening to, or pause/play or skip the song. In order to stop the song, I am having to switch my phone off and then back on. The app is not useable.",0
"I like that most of the songs are here and playlists are so fun to make, i don't have any problems on it in web chrome computer...!! But...spotify app on phone...T___T I can't play my playlist start to bottom, the only option is shuffle!? :< It is so unecessary!! I can't even view my friend's playlist description fully :;(âˆ©Â´ï¹`âˆ©);: Please don't make shuffle the only way to play the playlist please!! Oh and also, why do I need to be in college to get premium!? TOT",0
No interruption from ads but a decent price as well as their bundles for family it's really good I recommend you to listen to music from here,1
I really love the new 'swipe to add to queue' feature! Something that I've always wanted! Overall I love the app! Just a few more bug fixes and we're good to go! Cheers!,1
The best music app I have used so far..,1
It is ok - gud app but the amount of ads here is damn annoying like It smtyms makes me wanna uninstall this app becoz of the ads like it's damn annoying pls fix that ðŸ˜,0
It's crashing everytime I play something.,0

"Music keeps stop playing randomly very frustrating, really disappointing",0
Spotify app has been kept abruptly freezing and unstable in my One plus 9R device. Requesting team to look into the same. It's more guess because of the recent OS update by one plus,0
"Along with the wrapped for a year, Spotify should also give the count for the number of ads given per year . Other than the too many ads , it is good for listening to music",1
It's not bad at suggesting music after few months,1
"The music is great, but why can't I renew my subscription in Nigeria, it sucks because I have tried all the cards I have and yet it's declining the cards. Mind you it accepted the card when I initially started",0
The best place to get your music,1
Yo Spotify explain to me why every time I play the JRE podcast the app closes. But if I play anything else never happens. I will change my three stars back to five stars if someone can explain this. Yes I have uninstalled and reinstalled updated restarted my phone the whole nine yards.,0
"I sub Apple music and Spotify, still deciding...so far so good.",1
Excellent service well worth paying the premium on it,1
Podcasts are garbage on this app. Just rip off a better app to manage podcasts. Music is pretty good,0
"Please, when I want to listen to a song, don't put another dong form that stupid playlist you made. I want to listen the song i searched.",0
Got the replacement of Spotify I swear will never download Spotify again your adds really sucks. I don't understand why Spotify disturbs so much to its free customers.,0
"I legit just closed the app because I couldn't switch playlists, went on to a 7th or 8th ad just now.. This app is Full of Repetitive ads ruining the whole experience.",0
"Spotify in a nutshell: ""hey this person is genuinely enjoying this song/playlist & playing it often. Y'know what, let's hoard it away & put a bunch of ads in it so that if that person has depression or something worse & this song makes them happy, they can't listen to it! I mean, who cares what they want/do to themselves unless they're paying for premium! ðŸ˜€"" Music is power & you're taking that away with this bs. I'm giving this 4 stars since u don't respond to ur 1 star reviews. fix the system.",0
I love music and podcasts sooo,1
Best App ðŸ‘ Premium Version is Recommended. There's a Glitch ... Its not letting me Play any Music And Closing App :( Fix pls ðŸ¥º,0
"Kept randomly pausing playing music and podcasts. Done everything to fix it but to no avail. Finally uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but can no longer access the application after that step. It remains stuck on the green logo and doesn't matter how long I wait, it stays there. I have done everything, cleared caches, forced stop, clean reinstallations, checked for updates on app and phone (Samsung s10), everything, and nothing works. Only this app has stopped working. I am a Premium user.",0
I hate ads I hv premium account I shouldn't hv ads,0
"This is very good app , easy to use and can find almost every song but it can improve also...",1
I enjoy the music lots of things to listen too,1

"Can not play anything i have 2 accounts ive followed all help prompts, cant fix the issue cant see the play option persists that im set to offline when im not and my internet works perfectly on other apps. Im not paying an app i cant use het solutions for easily.",0
Me encanta esta aplicacin la verdad estoy considerando pagar una suscripcin,1
"I love music so I love spotify. But since I did the update the app is horrible. I cant play music as I want, all my downloaded songs are gone and the button which shows what song is playing is also not available... if this will not be fixed as soon as possible spotify has one customer less.",0
"In this version, the player controls are always disappearing, requiring me to force quit the app and restart it in order to even stop playback.",0
I can find 95% of the tunes I search for on Spotify. Their automated playlists hit the spot. Still waiting for the higher resolution streaming service though.,0
"They have made a lot of updates & fixes since my last review. I am loving Spotify again! I use it every day. All of my previous glitches have finally been fixed. No complaints here except for the desktop version. It's a bit messy, visually. It's hard to navigate because it looks so different than the app. I'd love to see desktop minimization options, like a widget.",0
I changed my rating due to spotify choosing what's ok for me to hear and what's not. If JRE was anywhere else I'd never use spotify again on principle. I dont think my tantrum will change anything but it's better than nothing.,0
"really good app but ads are annoying, lol",0
"I love the app but this happened b4 so when I like want to play a song,it won't play the right song.",0
Amazing Love the music quality!,1
"Had Premium for years now and always absolutely loved Spotify, but it is IMPOSSIBLE to listen to now - the app refuses to load when i tap on it, constantly crashes and even when it does actually start playing it constantly skips and glitches! What on earth am i paying money for Spotify??? And when exactly will this be fixed???",0
"The app is getting worse and worse. Despite reinstalling, restarting etc. It's been getting more and more unresponsive and the offline capacity is degrading progressively. Basically if you're already with a better streamer, I'd stick with them.",0
"Buggy in android from the last month. Won't open or play or load any tracks, takes atleast 10mins to start and whatnot. Won't feel like resucscribing the next month",0
Make it so I can pin more than 4 playlistartist make it like 10,1
Been using Spotify for 8 years and no complaints!,0
1. Equalizer not always working after a few songs. 2. Don't import your music to play on spotify or you must press like â¤ï¸ button hundreds / thousands time as much your local music collection to remove it.,0
"I really like this application. I got 6 months of Spotify Premium for free then $9.99/month after that with my Walmart+ membership. Respectfully, Jacqueline Gonzalez Fort Worth, TX",1
so amazing app I feel relaxe after listening the music from spotify,1
"Please add flac 16bit/24bit quality for premium user. After last update often force closed, please fix",0
Wide variety of music. App is easy to use.,1
"Used to be good. I have over 1800 songs in a playlist and it will play the same maybe 150 songs. It'll also be at ""the end"" of the playlist waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy too soon. What happened Spotify?",0
Spotify is amazing app for music I'm using this from long back . But now suddenly in the middle of on going music this app suddenly gets close and I'm not able to hear songs in good concentration because of sudden app problem . So I request please make your app more interesting and update your app.,0
Its good but ADS keeps coming ,1
Genuinely very useful and entertaining app...,1
I love using Spotify but it goes thru tumes where the pause button disappears and in order to get whatever I'm listening to to stop I have to Force Stop it.,0
"Just installed the app. I enjoyed it while I had it, but nothing is worth promoting Joe Rogan and his dangerous puedoscience. Spotify is choosing money over human lives and that's sickening.",0
"All honesty it's ok but it's really frustrating when it plays a song that I never up into my Playlist no matter how many I put in it. Please fix this I want to listen to my music not the music that you play for me, thanks. Also for some reason it doesn't di that on my computer",0
I love it but it keeps adding stuff to my playlists Its annoying,0
"The app is one of the more comfortable apps in questions of music streaming. The premium can be a bit expensive, especially since *I* pay it for add skipping and selecting music. Also it can be buggy or bit slow. Would give it 5 stars if the premium was a bit less expensive but besides it's good.",1
"Spotify's recent decisions to support a deplorable woke culture, in favor of gutting free speech, I've deleted my spotify and moved on. Sickening stuff",0
"Absolute garbage. This app banned Donald Trump, the true president of the United States. It also has nonsensical podcasts about racist, white-hating, leftist, communist trash. Not to mention you can't listen to music on here. This app is only for ads. One song plays, then an advertisement. Another song, then another ad. Delete this trash app and start again",0
"Amazing playlists, the quality is also very good, totally recomended",1
Amazing every genre of song and so many different ones I love it ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜¯,1
Great music choices and podcasts,1
Good,1
Spotify is so good cuz ðŸ˜© dem songs b3 good,1
"UI developers are supposed to make the UI better, not worse. Seems like some dev needed to justify their existence at Spotify and created this stupid new layout so they could look busy at work. Its garbage. Go back to UI kindergarten and revert the complete nonsense changes that were made to music controls (left aligned buttons)",0
It would be nice if the lyrics of songs have an option of english so that it is easy to sing if someone is foreign to that songs language Secondly there isn't an option from where i could download a single song from a playlist whenever i try to download a song the whole playlist gets downloaded,0
"It annoys me that I cannot properly block/ remove certain shows from my home page. I've tried everything mobile and on pc, but nothing seems to work. Please add an option to customise your home page.",0
"It's so good to listen to good music on a user friendly platform,but still room for improvement, Spotify is oviously the best out there. HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOWNLOAD",1
"Missed using Spotify premium, but when I can I can wait to listen uninterrupted and withvmy library downloaded. id sing every song on my library and wouldn't need the lyrics for most of my songs. don't believe me? Hmu. I'll prove I'm correct. â™¥ï¸ðŸ˜˜",0
It keeps getting better just disappointed that I can't scroll to the letter anymore...,0
The app works fine on desktop but this app on phone takes forever to load certain pages sometimes. Sometimes it's pointless to even download music when you have to wait for your downloaded music like a whole 2 minutes just to finally listen to it. Idk the app buffers so much and I've had this problem for a little over a year now. Even when I hit play or pausing a sound it takes forever for it to play or pause. It's not my wifi since I checked and have a good connection.,0
This app gives me reason to listen songs,1
you ain't free. Not by a long shot. Podcasts rock though! I don't know when the ads will start there too.,0
"I have a problem with mine, i can't have any lyrics...that's a real problem, is there anybody that can help me with that...i tried updating it, uninstall, restart, clear data but it still doesn't show anything.",0
"This app actually sucks. I can't even play my playlist, instead I just get some other song I've never even seen before.",0
So many songs. Easy to navigate,1
Love it always playing my jams every morning when I awake thank you spotify,1
Not show on phone can't stop music play I had turn my phone off turn back on make music stop,0
"App works fine, but if you don't have premium it's more ads than music. Also worth noting that you can't type in a specific song and listen to it without paying for the service.",0
"I will admit I was being a bit harsh but I still hate that I can't pick my own songs and the bugs. FIX THE BUGS. I seriously hate the small amount of skips, but it's still a great app.",1
Terrible for music. YouTube Music is far superior.,1
"If I could give this 0 stars I would. I really don't see the point of not being able to choose the song you want. And in addition to this, when you search a song and click on that song, it plays a completely different song. Honestly what the hell is that. Who else agrees? Never thought I would be saying this but I'm switching to SoundCloud, SCREW YOU SPOTIFY!!!",0
Motherhacker podcast plays unexpectedly every day and I can't clear my history,0
Bug is detected in new vivo T1 44w Due to which it gets exit Everytime I play a song,0
todo bien,1
Best music streaming ever.,1
LOVE it! Listen whenever we are on our golf cart (which is quite often)ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ†,1
This is by far the best music app ever... Been using Spotify for many years and can't see myself without it... I love many different genres of music and they're all right there at my fingertips...,1
"The last update took away the scroll bar from your liked songs library. Do you know how annoying it is to scroll through 2,000 songs? Add the scroll bar back. I want to be able to jump to my songs that start with F without scrolling all the way. Supper annoying Spotify",0
"Great collection, Playlist to similar interest, artist, and genre is on point !!",1
In the beginning of when you open it you have ads but then it works fine just the 1 thing you should fix is to add more skips but over all it is the best app I have ever used for music.,1
"Listen to what ever music you like, its all on Spotify. Blue tooth to ear pods, smart speakers or your car. Price is cheap by the month. Gotta go my song is playing!",0
"It's a really good app, but i would suggest adding a feature that lets you shuffle the songs on your playlist, because its annoying when you create a new playlist and add songs from an album and then from another album and so on and so on... But finally when you have all the songs on the playlist, but the artists are in kind of layers and if you try to suffle them by your self it takes ages. I don't now if anyone who could fix this problem ever sees this, or does he get the idea i have.ðŸ˜”",0
"Lowering from five stars due to a critical bug which hasn't been fixed in a week. Play bar disappears, music randomly stops and resumes playing. Can't believe Spotify has let this issue linger for so long despite so many complaints from premium subscribers",0
"i love using this!! it's just that after a couple months whenever i opened the app i no longer had the option to skip anything, even when i had my skips",0
I don't like the new update because you just have to get prime change a couple things like to turn off shuffle and to turn on replay,0
This is the worst experience ever i logined my Spotify account but it says 'no internet try again' And there is no history in my song list fix this pls!!,0
I'm new to this Spotify and I really like it,1
It's good for music but I really don't like it when it mixes up my songs with ones that aren't on my Playlist it really makes me mad and when I can reshuffle to not listen to those songs,0
Ever since i moved to india the app wont let me login at all - and i was on the premium tier. Gone are all my playlists and downloads. Not a good experience and its such a bummer because i spent so much time categorising all of my favorites :(,0
"Great for music, but some improvements are needed. Shortcut good morning tiles should update based on frequent or recent use, but don't. You should be able to delete parts of listening history so the app doesn't make your future suggestions based on what you don't like, but you can't.",0
"Just switched to Spotify from Pandora and I have to admit that I like it! The lyrics function is very cool, I wish I could keep them always on instead of reopening lyrics for each song",1
I like this spotify is really sweet,1
It's good but lot of advertisement,1
The app was great until this last update. Now I can't use the menu to play or skip the podcast I'm listening too. I have to close the whole app to pause and open it to play again.,0
"Love the app, the adds aren't bad and most songs are on there, however, whenever I make a playlist with only 1 song in it, (1 song but it's in there alot, so like baby shark in a playlist 5 times) whenever I play the playlist songs i don't want to be in there pop up, I'm pretty sure they are from the 'what we added' part in the playlist but you can't get rid of them! You can only hide them but they are still there, It's seriously annoying.",0
Spotify team cheating us thet said uninterrupted listing for 30 mins but every complition of 2 songs ad is comingðŸ˜¡,0
Very Good Music Quality ðŸ˜Š,1
"Login issue on mobile data. Everything else works. Spotify web player also works. But spotify app doesn't allow me to login on mobile data. App works on wifi but not on mobile data. Tried clearing cache and wiping data, restarting phone nothing works. Still not working.",0
"LITERALLY TEN ADS IN A ROW. STOP ADDING MORE AND MORE ADS PLEASE, IT'S GETTING RIDICULOUS. like, I hardly even wanna use the app anymore because 70% of the time, it's ads.",0
This app in the past few updates has ruined the experience in certain ways. Using Bluetooth specifically has become a problem and rather cumbersome. The app crashes a lot while connected to my vehicles multimedia system or even a Bluetooth speaker with any kind of controls.,0
"I tried this because of all the fuss in the media, until then, I wasn't interested. Having tried it, I've ditched ipod and this is now my go-to for music. My Mum and Dad love it too because there's something for the over 60s! Try it yourself, we doubt you'll be disappointed",0
"It's ok, I just wish we could skip songs or rewind or go back to the previous song",1
I got 5gb downloaded music data on my phone storage and tried to move it to my sd card in the spotify app settings but it didn't finished and now I can't open the app it says it is not responding! I'm paying for this app now what do I do?!!!,0
When you have premium with no ads or recommended songs it's really good and you can listen offline and all the fun things plus you can listen to stuff on repeat which is nice. So in all this app is a great music streaming app,1
"It's my favourite app, but I have premium, so there are no ads. I'm not sure how it's like for other people, but in my opinion, best app ever 10/10",1
It's always nice to know where these companies stand. Spotify chooses deadly misinformation.,1
It used to be ok because you would get ads like every 5 minutes or something like that but now it's awesome because I think they removed ads or I have premium and just don't know it either way I'm not complaining it's an awsome place to listen to music on,1
"i'm a premium user, and i don't understand why the app just stops the music midway and closes by itself. it's so annoying. we're paying, and even if we aren't we need good service.",0
I have the right number of times but the spotify,1
App is the shhhit...alot of repetitive music on the artist but...good also adding more ads is goin to probably cause app rating to go down...,0
The best music app ever. Very intuitive,1
"By far the best music listening app. However, for some reason, when skipping a song forth or back, my phone's fps drops to 3. I don't know how skipping a song makes it this laggy. But other than this minor user experience issue, great app!",1
Love spotify!!!! Listen to them every day,1
The best music app when you upgrade to premium. All categories of music with the best sound quality.,1
App Is not working .. whenever i try to play a song ..the app closes automatically .,0
way better than pandora. Whatever algorithm it has it knows what I want to hear. it doesn't just randomly put a song I hate or the same song on there. And not everything's mainstream and the podcast are the truth.,0
"love it but it keeps undownloading my playlists randomly, I am connected to wifi, it doesn't need an update and i still have 1 playlist downloaded pls help me",0
Shuffle play doesn't work in liked songs. Before like if I left the app and went back into it another day instead of playing the song that I left it at it would do a different song.,0
Leaving premium version due to irritating sexual podcast upfront on home screen. No way of getting rid of that. No way to disable them. I barely listen to any podcasts.,0
"I used to love this app, but the past month it has been a train wreck. I don't know if a update screwed it up or what, but I have no control over it anymore. It keeps pausing/unpausing songs, skipping, and playing even when the app is closed. It's absolutely horrible, and I do not recommend.",0
"Low res covers with average sound quality... Like what are y'all storing that's so taxing on storage, y'all don't even offer lossless. why?",0
"I've been using this app since 2016 and I don't know how they are able to achieve this, but from a great music app, every single update they released from then has made it worse and worse. I had an issue with album art being either such low quality, that it's actually disgusting, or that it doesn't seem to appear at all. I've reached to Spotify almost a year ago with this problem and all they said is that they are ""aware of the issue"", yet nothing they did fixed it, they made it even worse.",0
This is a very good service for laptops and desktops but the new updates are totally ruining the experience for mobile users and making it horrible. There used to be a kebab menu (three dots) icon whenever you searched a song which allowed you to add it to a playlist directly. Now you must play the song before adding it to a playlist because the three dots disappeared. Also mobile users don't have the option of rearranging the songs on a playlist. Please resolve these issues ASAP.,0
Even without premium it is a great music app,1
"Been using for months but needs update. Glitching, not restarting shows just issues overall. Still use for 6-8hrs daily but as a premium member paying $12.99/month plus tax they need to do better.",0
"So far, so good! If Spotify would be open for suggestions, consider partnership with a strong online startup specializing in providing ACCURATE instrumental score to the songs WE, your customers, listen to. (I'm sure a creative mind would see this and take it to the team.)",1
"Its one of the best music listening apps but they have way too many ads. The say '30 mins of uninterrepted listening' but after 10 mins they just give a ad. I never have a problem with 2 seconds ad but they are taking it too 30 seconds! And lyrics, WHY CANT I FIND LYRICS I HAVE UPDATED IT AND STILL. No all users can take premium but they dont care. They will continue to give 2-3 ads everytime.",0
Lots of bugs since the last update. Unable to pause or skip songs as the banner has disappeared,0
trash keeps on loading nonstop,1
Everything is cool but hate ads..,0
Now playing bar keeps disappearing. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Super frustrating!,0
Fantastic enjoy every moment when listening.,1
"The settings, options and display s have changed and spoilt my experience.",0
They will not allow you to add your music from the memory card for free,0
When I try to log in via Facebook it says that something went wrong(((((,0
"I really hate how I play a song and another song that I don't know plays, and I hate how it just plays random songs in the playlist. So annoying, the PC is a lot better, the android version is bad",0
"Used to be ok, now it's impossible to change podcast listening order on desktop. It's reverse chronological no matter how you sort it. The ""fix"" is to use the mobile app to play the first episode, then the autoqueue actually works. The issue with that is that the mobile app is also bugged and only displays the information of the first episode played, just adding the next episode's run time to the first one. This jacks up the 15s rewind button by making the entire episode start over instead.",0
Automatically the app iss crashes when I play the song.,0
great app,1
The app is although good but when i installed it again i tried to hear song but it was not starting and playlist was also not opening plz solve this issue or i will again uninstall it it is my warning okay ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¤.,0
Reliable. Super wide selection.,1
"I came to a JRE podcast's YT edit, got stuck repeatedly scrolling down to the 100s, I read: 'Isn't working, wait, send feedback?'- seems like a sad way to introduce me to your app. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. I'LL HAVE TO TRY TO PIECE THINGS TOGETHER IN SEGMENTS OF A PODCAST & NOT THE ACTUAL, COMPLETE THING IF IT'S ON SPOTIFY. WHAT A BAD DECISION FOR HIM TO MAKE; HEARD HOW HE WAS FORCED TO ERASE/NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN OTHER PODCASTS FOR THE CASH IN HAND. THAT'S CENSORSHIP. THIS IS PATHETIC. SEEYA JOE",0
"Gots music. N music we love. I use it most when I don't want to be the dj n need a clutch station to vibe to that I know I won't have to hit skip 20x in a row before I get something that feels right. Even if I don't know the artist or song Spotify does a pretty good job on matching the vibes of what I already have liked n listen to onna normal basis so you'll definitely expand your library n artists w/ ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¯. Let's be real we want good music n it provides period, shii 5â­ðŸ––worthy otg!.",1
"This app is awesome all the old music that I lost I have regain them , just perfect app.",1
Don't change a running system! Since the latest update the app is totally broken. Fix it! PS: Test your stuff before release.,0
Great music app and the ads aren't bad,1
I love Spotify,1
"Just about any song you've ever heard, and a bunch you haven't. Great app!",0
"Great music selection. However recently the app keeps cutting out/UI freezing. Sort it out Spotify, were paying customers. Seems to get worse each update. Maybe Google music is the way forward. Taking an additional star off for sneaking in ads on a premium service.",0
This is my life,1
"This is the first time I have used this app, so I don't have much to report. So far I like it... I'll leave another comment about this once I use it a bit.",1
Best app for listening music and best audio quality ðŸ˜,1
Way too much ads :(,0
"Please add a ""remove from suggestions"" option. !! Great app, grateful for accessibility to so many artists and albums. Really hope all the Artists and musicians are getting compensated properly. So much homogenisation due to internet exploitation. We all know that musicians bring honest hard work and deserve to earn real honest money from their efforts. Thank you, grateful to the artists. Peace",1
Awesome varieties of pretty much any genre of music one could want,1
"Enjoying it so far, but how can I select song or rather use song as a ring tone.",0
Great music until you lose your phone. Have had for 10+ years and hours of playlists gone! No customer support and charging me twice per month for commercials and no offline. FO.,0
"I can find almost any song in this app.... plus the lyrics ðŸ’¥, it's really cool",1
For past few days I don't know why but their are some songs that I didn't heard once gets added up in the queue. Please look after this problem.,0
Progress bar constantly disappearing when connecting to Bluetooth sources. Just gonna move to Tidal now. Bye.,0
So I am a Non-premium user. I opened app and played a song. It started playing ad. Usually I kill the app and reopen it and the song starts directly. But this time I was patient and understanding and I waited for the ad to complete. But it went on playing 4 ads of 30 seconds each. That moment I closed it and went to youtube. Songs are all about mood. I understand why ads are important but you guys are straight away killing the mood. No other platform has such terrible ads-play management.,0
Please do something about ads. I don't think 30 minutes is equal to 2.5 minutes. After every song there are 2 ads. Seems like this app is gonna become fully paid.,0
"If I click to play music on PC, it shouldn't start playing podcast on my phone's speakers! Basic stuff, hire product manager.",0
I love spotify! I love creating play lists and picking the music I want to listen to instead of random selection. The have that feature too if you like that. The options are the best part,1
Spotify itself is great but I thought I should say on multiple occasions I've had to watch up to 6 add in a row and songs I remove from my playlist always show up (especially when I am out of skips)but all around cool app (edit) my free trial for Spotify premium ended like a week early. NOT COOL,0
Music keeps playing with no controls to stop it. Very annoying and often embarassing. Spotify is going the way of Winamp and Blockbuster.,0
"I'm seriously gonna delete the app, can't even pick a song of my choice! It randomly shuffle songs everytime ðŸ™‚ seriously annoying",0
"This update on the pixel android software is a nightmare, I constantly have to quit the app and reopen to get the basic functions working. The playing bar down the bottom won't show up neither will the playing preview in the drop down on my phone so I have no way of playing or pausing the music. I love spotify so I'd love an update to fix this",0
"They play other music than i choose, i choose a play list, and Spotify play something else, i dont recomend Spotify.",0
Better than I thought... damn! Keep the awesome work.,1
"Please, fix thisðŸ˜­, I can't even play a single FULL SONG, everytime I click on that particular song, it only has it's trailer or it only plays about 10 seconds of the whole song. Plus I can't play my playlist because of that shuffle button...I swear... I'm crying my balls out for not figuring how to play a song.. its- it's really really really difficult to use this app especially as a non-premium user... I'm looking forward to a better version of this appðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",0
Best audio streaming app used ever !,1
Trash always cuts out every couple of minutes been with them for years but will be cancelled shortly unless it's fixed asap.,0
"Need help.. I redid my account after nearly 10ish years. It says I have no internet access, but I know I do. I've looked at all the settings in the app, I just can't figure it out.",0
Every thing is good but there are too many ads,0
I absolutely love Spotify,1
voice quality is good,1
"Ruined by update. Now, the song that is playing does not show up in app or even notification bar. This is terrible. Fix it asap",0
I have used Spotify for years. It is now completely unusable. It just crashes immediately whenever I try to play any thing. Problems have been getting progressively worse for months. I have to cancel my subscription until they fix this.,0
Over joy,1
"It's a good app, but it gets boring after a while.",0
"App is unusable in the last 3 weeks. Music stops playing with locked screen, control bar and recently played is also missing. This is completely unacceptable for a service that we are paying for.",0
"Way too many ads, especially given what they pay artists. Making skippable ads for YT is fine because you're on your device; but the point of playing music is to not be staring at your device and thus skippable ads are dumb for this app",0
great,1
I've loved Spotify for a while now and its a great app it just doesn't.. work sometimes. My playlist won't update and it says it only is 27 hours long when I know it's way more than that. Songs also won't do the preview thing anymore when I press Edit playlist. The play button isn't even there. :/,0
brilliant,1
The ONLY reason I started really using Spotify and now pay for premium is FOR Joe Rogan podcast. Please protect free thinking pocasts Spotify!,0
Great as long as you can cough up 10 bucks a month,1
"Getting same problems as others with samsung galaxy. No player so cant skip songs or pause, you have to start playlists from the start as theres no continue listening bar Crashes constantly, currently stops playing every 15 seconds or so",0
"I love the app but I don't like that, there's so many adds and I can't skip a song for as many time as I want. I can just skip 6 times and that's it. That makes the whole app annoying but therefore the app is good.",1
Love the music for good price ðŸ‘Œ,1
Amazing app best app for music ðŸŽ¶,1
I've enjoyed ad-free music for a couple of years now. Haven't had any issues technically or otherwise.,1
Had premium for 7 years. Found my favorite music and the style that makes my life better.,1
You know Spotify I don't believe there is one bad thing I can say. I have the premium package and I put on my little mix that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE to drive to and I NEVER have to worry about a commerical or anything. I just love it. Thank you keep up the good work!!!,1
Spotify has gotten much better than ever before. Great app and easy to use. Unfortunately they Censor quiet a bit of fact based political information like the X22 Report and Jordan Sather. But you can find them elsewhere,0
Paid for premium and I'm still getting advertising,0
"Love it, just wish there was less ads!",0
Overall good app but to many ads,1
Haven't used in 6 months. LOTS of bugs that need fixed!,0
"The app has been incredibly glitchy the last few months - can't like songs, filter on liked songs doesn't work, songs won't play and app freezes all the time. I'm so close to giving up on Spotify altogether",0
"When I open the app while a podcast is playing it will mark it as played instantly and close it. Leaves me searching for where it stopped. FRUSTRATING!!! Also, let's get it to the SD card... please!!!!",0
"Pause and play banner disappears within Spotify app. Cannot turn off podcast or music except by closing app, which is ridiculous. Also, no simple option to play just one podcast, rather than being bombarded by countless episodes on an autoplay. Spotify seems to lack technical nous. Even Acast allowed only one episode to play without issue.",0
I only got to listen one day. But I think it's pretty cool.,1
"Seems to have gone very buggy recently. If I'm listening to music, pause and then come back to the app a few mins later, the window at the bottom of the app isn't there to restart playing. But if I close the app manually and restart it, that window is there again and I can unpause.",0
Very good I like all music is nice,1
Login experience is not good here. Most of time I don't get otp. And resend OTP has some wating time . It's sometime spoils the mood of hearing songs .,0
It's Awesome.....we can listen to any song I recommend this app to anyone who loves music....ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜™ðŸ˜™,1
Very very very good,1
"i reset my phone a few days before, and when i installed spotify again, it literally doesn't work. i tried creating a new account and logging in with it but still no luck. all the playlists that are being suggested to me are 'empty', I can't search for any artist/song, can't add any songs to a playlist i create. if i somehow find a song i can play and tap it, it literally does nothing. I tried uninstalling and re installing but still face the same problems please get to this and fix it asap",0
Too many ads. You get like 6 at a time.,0
I love this app and enjoyed listening all kinds of songs everyday.,1
"Not reliable enough to pay for. If you're willing to put up with crashes and times where it just won't open, fine. Just don't pay for it expecting the paid subscription to change anything; it doesn't.",0
"Keeps crashing on Samsung S20+, and the PLAY BAR is just randomly missing...so no controlls to start or stop content! Fix it",0
It is a very fun experience very efficiently because u can have an endless amount of song options to choose from,1
Top selected songs. Sound quality is superb.,1
Very simple and nice app to use. Love the playlists it curates for me at times they just spot on. Great algorithm,1
They're just not offline music but everything else is simple to play with simple to start up and very good music,1
"Works fine except for group session and it is extremely saddening and there is no reason it shouldn't work, we both have premium and they are both updated please fix this.",0
"Awesome until I realized that it says ""Music without ads"" which is super sneaky and means that you get ads when you listen to podcasts and it's HECKIN rude",0
"This app is worse than bad. Worst performing app on my phone. Screws up on am s22 ultra. Nonsense. They know it and won't or can't fix it with inept developers. Don't waste your money on premium. Just listen to Rogan from the free one and fast forward the commercials. Spotify, you should be ashamed.",0
"Getting really buggy - down from 5 star to 1. On moving off the app and back on, the play bar disappears and I have to reload the whole app. Occasionally says it's playing but with no sound, which happens on different devices (home speaker, car speakers, etc) and often between song switches, meaning I have to disconnect and reconnect to continue. Overall, becoming a really annoying experience for some basic functionality.",0
I really enjoy as it is ad free.,1
Good music spotify,1
Bad. For some strange reason my app is not working. I switched to premium and now the app just starts and shuts. Don't know if this issue is connected with my mobile or otherwise. Looking forward to hear from the technical team of Spotify thanks..,0
"I hate it on how it suddenly changed, it was just like I can play everything now I can't the only thing I could do is shuffle musics that I liked ðŸ™",0
"Excellent it has all the music I want ,very affordable price.",1
"The only reason i have spotify is for the joe rogan experience and its almost not worth it the app co stantly crashes, changes what im listening to the way it works is trash i have to uninstall and re install this stupid app at least twice a month i ho estly cant believe people pay for this trash",0
why can't i just choose a song that a wanna hear and yet there's so many ads this new update sucks,0
Selections of songs & sounds crispy ðŸ‘Œ,1
"Unskipabke Ads after every 2 songs played, poor-autoplay recommendation relative to YouTube, miniscule inventory.",0
All I need in music in one place and find so much more I can discover for the first time. Great app great functionality. Thank you Spotify team,1
It's good but the songs I searched disappear after I reach the end I was wondering if you could increase the amount of songs that can be at the search history,0
You have everything I need,1
This app very good every one should try it,1
Great music choices and easy to use,1
Nice app. Buying premium soon ðŸ˜Œ,1
I love spotify. I've been a customer for years and have been highly satisfied up until recently. I'm not sure what happened but this app drains my battery. Drastically. I'll lose 25% in an hour. Doesn't matter if I'm using head phones or not. Even with a brand new phone.,0
Find all your favorite music and podcasts here!its perfect,1
"Spotify! So brilliant, you can search and select any songs. You can create a music diary which you can use time and time again. I have my Romantic mix, R&B mix, pop mix, etc.",1
Lovely app,1
"The absolute best streaming service in my opinion. Got premium for a free trial a few years ago and never looked back. Only wish I could put more than 10,000 songs in a Playlist because I'm getting close.",0
After the last update the music cuts out and pauses all the time even with downloaded playlists.... I been a customer for years and I'm thinking about canceling my subscription.,0
Its the best music app ever but the only thing is that i need internet to play music,0
Disappointing that this is the best music app right now,1
Always advertising only Cant skip Not getting new songs Cash is needed for everything I dont like it this app,1
Spotify has great music and all kinds whatever your in to . I do not understand why i keep loosing my down loads though. And cannot play them off of my memory card,0
This is a amazing app I would like hear songs with this app I love so much,1
"I've been using Spotify Premium for years but lately it's been crashing more, my downloads haven't been appearing properly and the user experience has been sub par.",0
"Overall an amazing source for music. If you pay for the premium package it's par none. However, after maintaining a premium account for several years, I had let the membership lapse due to personal reasons. I've been using the free version for a while now and no matter how many advertisements I watch, I know, for a fact, I have never received 30 minutes of uninterrupted music. This being my only complaint. I use the app daily. Just stop lying about the 30 minutes of music.",0
"If you ain't paying for it, might as well go screw your self. It gets worse as the months go by. I only use the god awful app for 1 flipping podcast, and i have to un-reinstall 10x/podcast. Can't wait for Rogan to move platforms",0
Truly a lesson in how to make a UI as unintuitive as humanly possible. Figuring out if it's going to play the queue correctly or just pick it's own music is anyone's guess. Constantly stutters on wifi for no reason. Even with downloaded music.,0
"Am using Spotify premium, and in my new device running on Android 12 and snapdragon 695 shipset, the latest version of this app is crashing repeatedly as I'm playing a song. Please fix it with an update, till now I am using Spotify lite....but please do the needful asap",0
This is an amazing app coming from a person who loves listening to songs all day long.i love how there are lyrics to the songs as well and all my family started using this app since I downloaded it..I would recommend it alot.,1
"So far the best music streaming App, ever",1
"Any tunes I want whenever I want, and portable karaoke!",0
"I have been experiencing downloading over mobile data issue for 1-2 years now. I have done everything to fix it. I went through every single troubleshooting step with Spotify support team. I even replaced my phone with a different one and the issue continues! The problem is only ever solved temporarily, then comes back and I lose data and therefore money.",0
I've got premium and it's nice but I can't figure out how to clear my queue? I even open the queue and there's no delete or clear option. I'm on android and the app is updated.,0
There is a bug in your app I am not able to shuffle the songs by sliding over the top Indian navigation as I used to early Previous update has a bug please fix it.,0
It's amazing! Pandora doesn't stand chance. It gets the job done whether your DJing or clean the man for the job it's the best option.,1
"Best app any device could ever have if you're a music lover!!! I'd give it a 100 stars if I could!!! Oh, and the podcasts!!! ðŸ¤©",1
Just too many ads nowadays . Video ads then pop up ads it is so irritating now,0
There ain't a single better platform than Spotify... Best experience ever. I always wanted an app which would recommend me my type of songs and Spotify is freaking good in it. I am absolutely obsessed with this appâ¤ï¸,1
This app is good to listen music . But the on and only the problem is more ads are in it so just look into it. That's the main problem apart from that the app is fantastic,1
AMAZING,1
Really enjoy the app listening to songs I haven't heard in a long time. Not just greatest hits but B side songs as well. Glad I found you,1
It used to work but it's being constantly glitchy now and crashing all the time,0
Best app for listening songs I will give 5 stars to this song but one thing I didn't like that we like a song that is of any and other language so u write their lyrics also in that language we can't read it so please correct it if the song is of any other language please give its lyrics in English..............,0
Excellent music app,1
Has all my favorite music when you want it,1
"Well so far so good. Though one thing i noticed, i tried going for premium sportify even though it says first three month free after which subsequent month there will be charges, so after linking my card details it then pop up info sayin insufficient balance in account so i wonder why? Since i wont be charged for d first 3 months??",1
Randomly turns on or off. Lately it's been playing music but not giving me a bar to be able to pause or skip in the app or out so I have to close it out to stop it and go back to the app eveytime I need to change songs,0
The service of Spotify is great but the app is trash will not load or will crash repeatedly it appears that they do not maintain the app on a ongoing basis.,0
It's good but the thing to switch over for driving it won't work I have to disconnect my Bluetooth for it to register,0
Hands down best music streaming App Nothing else comes close. I've experimented with other platforms but nothing compares. When my friends tell me that they don't use Spotify I tell them that they're absolutely crazy. The podcast options are the best too. Joe Rogan's podcast is by far the best podcasts out there in Spotify is the place to get it. I am known to be a negative person but I have nothing negative to say about Spotify except for making me use 500 words to write this review. Holler?!!,1
I can find any song I want on this app. I love this!!!!,1
"i have to listen to 3 ads to listen to a minute song... everything u can do in spotify is a premium feature so might aswell pay for everything before downloading this app. worst music app ever, u cant listen to ur favorite song without getting interrupted. if i could leave a -5/5 star review i would.",0
Started to crash anytime I try to play a podcast,0
"I don't like the fact that you can only skip 6 songs an hour nor the fact that you can't just click on one song and listen to it,",0
Offers a wider variety of music than your standard radio,1
Great with premium membership on your phone and on other devices like consoles and PC's but without premium on your phone it sucks,0
"If you plan on paying to avoid ads and listen to podcasts or anything other than music, DO NOT BUY SPOTIFY. with the rising of people adding in content ads and such makes premium obsolete. They constantly try popping open some info on car mode while I'm driving which is a hazard. This app Is really really going down the drain. Just use apple music or Dropout TV. Or anything else really.",0
Spotify is awesome. Love being able to listen to all the 80s and early 90s hair metal,1
Super cool app i really love the multiple genre collection of music but i give it four because it would be even more awesome if you could download the music...since Spotify needs internet access. But other than that...this app rocks!!! Keep it up guys!!,1
Nice app but premium packs are to high to afford and advertisement are shown many times which irritates and breaks the rythm of listening songs..,0
"I know I have the free version and probably shouldn't even leave a comment but, it is really anoying to have an add heard so often. I use Spotify to play music to study and concentration and an add sounds every 1 or 2 melodies, I will probably stop using even the free version if it continues like this â˜¹ï¸",0
"Spotify is nice app no doubt, but need HI- RES audio for the premium users",1
"Good, but crashes when I open the podcast menu for the first time in a while. When I open the app again, it's fixed but it's a slight annoyance.",0
Spotify's best feature is the notifications for new releases by artists you follow. But that feature hasn't been working for months. After several updates.,0
Been using Spotify since day one,0
It starts playing in the background even when the app is closed and the settings are off. It is the most annoying thing in the world.,0
"What's with the crashes spotify? Can't u fix it? It's not only me, i think some have the same problem. I can't play on my phone, everytime i pressed play it just crash/close to my homescreen. I already uninstall and download it again but the same problem happen.",0
"player is not working, the song actually sounds but you can't control nothing of it, I had to close the app from multitask for it to stop playing",0
Good app but fix your bugs. They are too many!!!,0
"Honestly, it's fine but since the latest two versions my local files disappeared completely, i cannot even access them by going on my files on phone and try opening with spotify. Which is a bummer. If you plan on using spotify for local files, please don't, as they may not be supported. Try using a different music playing app for that.",0
My app keeps crashing after the last update. Tried uninstalling and installing. Tried clearing data and cache. Also tried logging out. Tried every suggestion. But it still crashes.,0
good,1
Good podcast and music,1
Too good,1
"- Stop getting rid of songs that are playable!!!! - I have downloaded songs and they keep saying 'unplayable' the next day - what's the point in all of this?? One of the ridiculous things of this app. - If a singer, band, or album is 'explicit' can you not just verify listeners that they are over 16 or 18 to listen???? Absolutely a joke ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ - Also, why does the app always crash ubexpectedly?",0
Great! I used to have qq music (the Chinese version of Spotify) and im trilingual plus an opera lover so I miss being able to have translation of foreign languages. Spotify only offers English lyrics for English songs. Translations of lyrics into english. That's the only feature I would suggest.,0
Amazing ðŸ‘ recommend this app with the premium feature,1
Great music that I use to study.,1
"I love the app, very easy to operate but i can't download and doesn't stream music",0
Nice collection and New system,1
I love Spotify this a good song app,1
it takes too long to download an album and I'm using a good wifi please fix this then it's goan be a deff 5 star and can u make the download animation like that of apple at least.,0
"Almost 3 years later, and i still rely on this app for the best audio quality and range of music available across any available platform. It never ceases to amaze me.",1
Very annyoing thing is when add comes i just can not understand that why they force us to freeking bye the premeum,0
My downloaded files are constantly getting deleted for no reason,0
"Honestly, I love Spotify. I use an iPhone and prefer this over iTunes ANYDAY! I would 100% reccomend!",1
Literally my escape. But it randomly stops working and I have to uninstall it every once and a while. It's stupid.,0
Wow... you know my favorite songs..,1
Lots of good music but lots of adds,1
I keep writing review and it disappears! On Android Bring back feature that puts red minus sign next to sobg in my playlist when I hide/dislike a song. Sometimes it's an accident and song I hid is nowhere to be found to reinstate it!,0
"Still have to go into it...it was advertised as free and I downloaded it, but it seems as if I'll have to pay to download.Still have to figure it all out. Will keep you updated",0
"Bluetooth cuts out along now, app freezes",0
There is no better app for your music and podcasts. I love that my screen can be locked while listening to my music.,1
"Get rid of the "" Hidden"" button. I accidentally hit the button but I could not find an option to bring the song back. Thank God, I was able to figure out the name of the song to add back to my Playlist.",0
This is really amazing for me cause I really love having lyrics when I listen a song and Spotify provided me this facility and I am satisfied with it,1
"The app stops working after minutes of use, when the screen shuts off so does spotify. All permissions are allowed. Fix the problem.",0
"A music streamer which became a manipulator, hosting shows with life threatening misinformation. Google, please don't remove my review because i will contact the media.",0
It's good but it just randomly ppl pauses every 10 or 30 seconds can someone explain how to fix this,0
LOVE THIS,1
Lies. That's what this app has. You don't get 30 minutes after ads.,0
The amount of ads is way too much recently! And all they promote in these ads is to switch to Spotify subscriptions!! Pathetic!,0
"Decent selection of music that I like to listen to overall. Shuffle mode malfunctions on a monthly basis for no apparent reason, and the only solution is to delete and reinstall the app, plus redownload the playlists. Shuffle mode also weirdly plays certain songs more often than others in playlists, or it doesn't play some songs at all.",0
"Let's gooo swipe to queue is here oh man I used to pray for times like this!!! But yo the miniplayer at the bottom keeps disappearing, have to close & open to see it",0
Love the songs hate the fact that I have to pay to play music in the car,0
Thank you Spotify for not caving to the cancel culture mob. In a time when the left loves to cancel anything they disagree with its good to know at least one platform has the cajones to not bow down to the mob.,1
I loved Spotify ...I've been using the premium from the past 1 year and ive not regret buying it even once ...love it great app for music !!!!!,1
"What's the point in ads, I'd give it a five star but last year 2021 it usually just never plays an ad. No idea why but since it's 2022 ads randomly started playing. Every music I listen to and ads starts after a song ends..",0
It has a lot of choices but it will pause my song mid way through or restart it.,0
"COVID warnings on podcasts now?? Are you kidding? 2+ years later? Now? Super LAME!! Download a podcast to play later, forget about it. Why? Because you NEED AN INTERNET CONNECTION!? Huh?? If it wasn't for Joe Rogan, I'd have bailed on this app a long time ago. it's so glitchy, unreliable, counterintuitive, stupid warnings. I have to force close it constantly & restart and sometimes it jumps to a totally random podcast maybe even a year old??",0
The hell is wrong with Spotify. It always play the wrong music,0
Great app to listen to music.,1
Love this app and the generated daily mixes loving it come on 1 month free .....give 6 months get loads of custom people don't use it every minute of every day .....make it so you can pay for a week or even a day like pay as you go,1
"Loved my play lists until now, I can't click on a play button to start list or choose song on list to play!",1
Hands down best music app,1
Very buggy! Rarely when you cast it a speaker!,0
"Wonderful application for music, podcasts and video! Thank you Spotify!",1
I love the type of music I listen to on the app,1
Everything is paid,1
"Hate everything. I hate the navigation, can't see the full playlist sometimes. Just want to find Moshpit by Que Violette, but its shuffled in a playlist. Just no. Not good for music, like I wish artists and podcasters would uoload somewhere else, Spotify SUCKS.",0
its awesomeness ,1
No time to review for a complete and thorough analysis!,0
"Love spotify. I am having issues though when I try to skip back to the beginning of a song, It won't but instead keep playing the song and some times the time of where I am in the song will be off. I have found work arounds but for this I give a 4/5.",1
This is the great app i have ever scene â¤ï¸ i like it alot and i will also suggest you all to use it too ðŸ¤—,1
Don't get me wrong I do like Spotify but what I really don't like about it is that it adds songs to your Playlist and some of the songs that they put on there are inappropriate songs that I don't want to listen to I hope this gets changedðŸ˜®â€ðŸ’¨ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜ª,1
"Please introduce an option to hide podcasts or separate them. I'm looking for music, stop mixing podcasts in with it.",0
"A bit buggy on mobile (Android 12 One UI 4.1), sometimes controller doesn't show what's actually playing, in app player may not show although a song is playing. These are quite big bugs, but I still give 4 stars. Patch it and you'll get 5 from me :).",0
This is the best music app ever 100%,1
"It's good music but like LET ME LISTEN TO WHAT I WANT TO LISTEN TO, I PUT IT IN MY PLAYLISTS LET ME LISTEN TO THAT AND NOT SOME RANDOM SONG YOU MIXED IN WITH IT",1
I've been using Spotify for years and I feel like when it first rolled out it was perfect but with each update Spotify just gets worse and worse. Often have issues with audio connection on my Bluetooth devices and the songs on shuffle are just repeated daily. So annoying! I don't want to hear the same songs everyday I don't even want to hear the same songs in a week that's why I have a huge library. New update is the worst won't even show the song I'm listening to and turns off after inactivity.,0
Entertaining beautiful musics clear sounds easy to access i like it,1
"Hi, I've been trying to subscribe for premium now for a while, each time i keep getting payment failed. There's nothing wrong with my card cause I've used it on both yt music and tidal.",1
Probably the most frustrating app in the store. Crashes often. Many features just don't work. (like add to queue doesn't even work) I'm a paid subscriber and quite disappointed.,0
This is the Best App ðŸ‘ Premium Version is Recommended!,1
"Premium User. App is becoming unusable, the currently playing controls disappear, thus no way to stop playing when you want to or it keeps cutting out thus stopping playing when you don't want it to! Sort it out Spotify!!!! As this appears to be a common occurrence reading recent reviews!",0
Good app very large variety from many years back. Thumbs up,1
It is the most amazing and revolutionary service that I can't live without.... But the app is absolutely atrocious. this is like the 10th time my review has been deleted for saying the same thing.,0
The best music app there is,1
The music is the best free music there is no more to say about it,1
Where's the off switch. It shuts off my radio and turns itself on in my car.,0
Can't scroll to the bottom part of the library.,0
"The ads make this application too annoying but I'm too cheap to pay for music otherwise. (Little trick just close the app if there's and ad and restart it, the ad will be gone.)",0
"This App is currently in a bad place. There's currently a few very obvious bugs that make navigating songs quite challenging. Really surprised this passed testing and surprised it's gone so long without fixes. Free websites and apps have better quality assurance, this is a luxury MONTHLY subscription...",0
Easy to find songs,1
"App has alot of bugs with last two updates, when selecting a song or podcast, what is selected does not appear on the bottom of the screen so can't stop/start or rewind or fast forward. Have to close down app and then reopen it for it to appear",0
"Let's be clear I love this app, but the issues with the extremely faulty and frequently disappearing media player and other glitchy bugs around that issue, have really destroyed my faith in this app. Please fix this Spotify",0
Hmm I don't know how much it meansJim I have Ronald is this a bama I said it more and Mexico City to you in persji I'm no longer in the market for a new job and I have to go to the store and get some rest and feel better soon and that I was able and Mexico City did not have the time and effort to be in Bridgeport ðŸ¦â™Šâ™Š lotongo a back I was going on in your flags for 10 I said it more and Mexico City to you about the lot is this a bama I said it more and Mexico City he said it more and Mexico City,0
App won't connect to the spotify in my vehicles radio now. It worked just fine a couple of weeks ago then all the sudden won't anymore. The phone connects but spotify does not. It plays though Bluetooth but not the spotify app. Has to be a update caused it. I have a pioneer avh-2500nex head unit.,0
"I have a love and hate relationship with this app, it plays songs but the thing is it plays suggested songs, I mean thanks, but I just want to listen to the song I want to listen to. I have to skip multiple songs just to listen to the song I want to listen too it's pretty annoying. Also why would u need premium to skip as many songs I want? I just want to listen to my song. One more thing pls don't automatically play suggested songs unless they want that, this is why settings exists.",0
The only reason this app is superior is the fact that has so many artists and podcast besides that it is so irritating to be listening to the liked songs that you have on your list and then catch an ad listen to two songs and then catch another add if not one song and another ad your skips don't even replenish after the hour you can time it yourself if you'd like to try last thing I have to complain about though is the fact that continues to play the same songs even though they're the most skip,0
Very happy with this App. Lovely songs and podcasts. Thank you do much.,1
Love every moment I never search for a song or artist and do find them.,1
Tried and true. This is an app that has always had u the subscriber as the most important part of their business. They have always had awesome content up to date and new stuff to hard to find obscure stuff and the player is easy simple to use for novice. Or you can adjust to your listening enjoyment.,1
Thank you for standing with Joe rogan. The narrative can't all be one sided.,1
"Bad update, ""unable to connect"" when upgrading to premium. Never like this before.",0
"Everything is good. I just have noticed some minor error, the profile pic doesnt load whennyou change them. Plus the there is no edit profile.",0
It randomly will play the podcast without the bar used to pause or skip so I am forced to close the app. It constantly pushes my phone's connection to my PC even though I haven't connected the device (device not even avalible when I am on PC) but yet the podcast I was last litening to gets loaded and I loose what ever music I was listening to on my PC. Don't even get me started on all the issue with Google maps app integration which makes for unsafe driving! Please contact me for more info!,0
Good choices but after going thru all artists I like. Not alot has come up,0
The amount of advertisements is absolutely ridiculous,0
"If y'all would like 5stars need more songs that are not posted. Step it up YouTube has all songs u desire and deserve. Plus it's free smh, so step it up Spotify!",0
Good app for a moment is sucked bc they tried to make it like tik tik but now it is good again,1
I think this app needs fixing because when I go to play my playlist it plays zero songs I have chosen and I can't stop the song either. Please fix this issue and stop adding songs to my playlist,0
"Promotes misinformation for profit, at a cost of human lives. Also (although a lesser concern), the app UI is just really bad, and they've had years to improve it. Giving Tidal a go and like it better so far.",0
Best free music and better when you pay for the full package.,0
"How can such a huge music application have such a bad software interface, it doesn't let me sign up or login to my account which i used before.",0
It's buggy AF after the most recent update. Also missing the currently playing bar. Like what happenedðŸ˜­,0
Too many ads. I rarely use spotify anymore cause the format is annoying and ads.,0
I hate this ever since I got the new update I've hadn't been able to listen to any music only for a few seconds and I'm happy that I'm not the only one that has this problem:/ fixed this amendment!,1
Good but is anoying to play a song,1
The app is good sound quality is also nice but lyrics spelling is wrong so the word is also wrong,0
Ok it's fine just 1 thing. Stop adding random songs to playlist just based on my music taste that I can't remove. Its annoying. I dont want them there.,0
I used Spotify Premium since one month without any hassles but experiance that songs on Playlists stop after 2 songs. That is very annoying having guests over for dinner and music stops all the time...! Very poor! It is time to move on and to sign up with another music download platform - Deezer...?,0
I liked the songs tht r playing thts y i gave it a 4 nd not 5 bcuz it has 2 much ads which i dont like playin in between while i am listening 2 my favourite tunes,0
"The app on Samsung is absolute hot garbage at the moment. It stops, crashes frequently",0
Spotify is easily the best music streaming app out there...if yoi have premium,1
"Spotify is a great app for listening music, the best. But podcasts, oh man, it terrible. Yeah, it got ton of exclusive podcasts but podcast section of app really messy and a hassle to operate. Please add a separate section dedicated to podcasts or just launch a separate app for just podcasts. Because honestly, I cant listen to Spotify exclusives on another apps and I dont want to listen to them on Spotify. Its a loss-loss situation for me.",0
"In my opinion: Spotify is the only way to stream,play,etc your music. 100%",0
"If the free version is constantly crashing, why the hell would I ever pay for premium service?!? Don't believe me, do a Google search for ""spotify keeps crashing"" and see the results. It will play 1 or 2 songs then stop. I tried clearing the cache, uninstalling/ reinstalling, adjusted the data mode, signed in/ out all with no change. Great catalog of music, but can't listen to it without regularly restarting my playlist every 5 -15 minutes. Please fix!!!",0
ExlentsuperkekaI love this appsuper super,1
Spotify changed my music listening habits from almost given up to fully addict to music. Radio station give you what they want you to hear not what you want to hear. Spotify changed all that for me. The best music app for me. #spotify addict.,1
The app is full of bugs. Really dissatisfied with the apps performance.,0
When first opened up Spotify it was a 5 star thing until today I found out that I can't put on my favorite songs but had to shuffle them all until I get my favorite song not only that on my Tablet it had the things that said that it didn't had to do the shuffle but just press on the full song instead of pressing on it for a sample of the song the things before the worst thing happened on my phone.,0
I dunno what changed but I keep having to restart to see the song that's currently playing. The option to filter my liked songs by category won't scroll so I only see the first four. Sometimes it plays but I can't use the app to change the song or search. Fix it!,0
"I'm trying to do a nap playlist but it keeps adding songs I don't want. I just want two specific songs, I don't want it adding a bunch of other things. It also added stuff to my other playlist which was four specific songs. I don't want the app adding songs it thinks are relevant, if I want a song, I'll add it. If they want to suggest songs, they may, but I don't want all of these other songs coming up. Edit: I deleted it. In addition, I can't listen to more than previews of the songs I like.",0
Awesome tunes all the time love how my music is categorized just for me and offline mode is great!,1
Only good with Spotify premium,1
Nice app . I liked it but try to avoid the ads plz . Its tooo annoying . After each song there is 2 or 3 ads ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜ðŸ˜’,0
"They used to have all the best artists, but not anymore! Also the app sometimes kills people through misinformation, a real bummer",0
"Definitely better than apple music, amazon music, Deezer,",1
"Having issues with playing music. Currently playing song isn't showing up on the app so there's no way of putting it on pause or skipping, adding to the queue , music often stops without a reason even when offline, playing downloaded playlist. Any ideas how to fix it?",0
Can't live without spotify premium anymore,1
"Smooth, reliable, and AFFORDABLE! I totally recommend it.",1
"Spotify keeps showing unexpected notification: trying to play..., when it is not run. it should Not be automatically trying to Blast into tunes unsolicited! and at unexpected times every day.",0
Just stoped working with my entertainment center and is super buggy.,0
Very good app for listening to music.,1
Nice but please take out money for premium I want premium tomorrow fovegive me please and also I play my game meanwhile it stop do something please I love Spotify but when I update Spotify it started acting wired and I also want offline instening,0
"Garbage. Used to love this app but haven't been able to use for several years, due to fact that it pauses constantly every few seconds or minutes (varies). Have tried EVERY suggestion found to try to resolve with zero luck.",0
"No Auto Artist and Album List. It is should be all about the songs. If I like the song, the artist and album should be generated into an auto list.",0
"Very extensive Global Library of Music. With membership the possiblities are endless. Reasonible prices, so far. Liberty to chose your preferrence.",0
"Really good app but lately been near unusable. Buggy as, needs fixing. I wouldn't complain if it was free but yeah",0
It connects great to my Google devices and great for on the go once you download your Playlist.,1
"It's better than iTunes, I can tell you that lol",1
Reslly good,1
Disappointing. Unable to find songs . Their 'suggestions' are not related to my search AT ALL. I find Spotify complicated & difficult to use....YouTube is by far easier. Relevant content appears IMMEDIATELY in the search bar and it is the PERFECT MATCH for the material i am looking for. Once I have completed this {negative} review I am going to uninstall Spotify :( ðŸ˜ž,0
"Last update is soo bad, please fix the current song playing bar from bottom not showing. I'm about to cancel my premium plan and switch to another music app. Please fire your development & QA team, they're utterly incompetent.",0
Don't seem to get much information with in this app but it's all there in Google so no worries yet but I'm new . love the music and I'm learning about more artists .like how they put music together that is similar l have chosen the premier setting so no adverts and wanted to be able to download some music .,1
The app has lots of ads that any one don't like,0
"App just gets more unstable. Everyday to open it, I need to force close it and clear the cache. This is for almost every single time I open the app. No other app has this issue on my phone. The more you update, the crappier the app gets",0
For my opinion Spotify is the best source of learning +hearing music and i can't say it that it's the best app for quality listening. You can found every thing hear.,1
"Would rate it 5 but the mini-player keeps crashing or just plain simple disappears. Tried everything, cleared cache, force stop, uninstall, cleared downloads but the problem just doesn't go away.",0
"My one problem i have been having for quite some time is if i open spotify and click over to search or my playlists too quickly, the app freezes and starts to load forever. Thus making me close the app, open it and then waiting for the home screen stuff to load.",0
Good search engine fir music can usually find whatever I'm looking for but lately thus apps pissing me offhalfway through my playlists or sooner I get kicked out of the app halfway through a song most times leaving me to restart the app and start the song I was listening to from the beginning again if it's not fixed soon ill be canceling my subscription and going elsewhere. I've been with these guys for years and it'll suck having to start from scratch but I can't do this especially driving,0
"The lyrics are not shown. I have done all the tips given in the community to fix this problem, but nothing has worked.",0
"Whenever I found it difficult to find certain information; I always found it by using Spotify; WHENEVER YOU FIND YOURSELF IN DOUBT, SPOTIFY IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT!!!",0
Great algorithms with powerful over top and I even like the very few ads ...WATCH OUT YU TUBE M!!! ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ,1
"Good variety, would like better streaming quality",0
"I gave three stars. Because, today when I opened the app I was shocked. It was playing songs in shuffle. And we can skip songs only 6 times an hour. It is annoying. Please remove this and make the app like previous version. Please don't make this app boring for a free user.ðŸ˜”",0
Great app if you have premium...,1
It's a good app to hear music and all songs are available to hear in Spotify.,1
"Spotify is one of those apps thats hyped up so much that people expect to much from it. Without premium it's an add fest but with it it's better by about 100%. Unlimmited skips, no annoying ads, and good quality when streaming. the only things I find annoying about the app is 1. It has a remove all downloads button directly above clear cache and I've deleted all downloads so many times when trying to clear cache. 2. The quality of the app is getting progressively worse with many many updates",0
This has all My fav songs 100% get this app,1
So i was feeling sick the other day and downloaded this app to listen to songs. First it gave me multiple options to login. I tried with gmail but it didn't continue with that. Then i tried with my phone number and i didn't get otp and then asked me to enter my Date of birth for listening to a song.... I uninstalled it and felt much better.,0
"I love Spotify, but sometimes there Playlist are repetitive",0
"I restarted my phone because the app would play my music but sound glitchey. When I opened the app after the restart, the glitcy sound made it unusable. And I know for a fact it isn't my phone because other apps work perfectly fine. Please fit this or tell me how to fix this, I'm literally paying yall monthly.",0
No problem in using this app got better experience here a large collection of song or we can say that universal collection...,0
Not good at all because we can't hear our favourite song without interruption of ads and for that also there are asking for money and i Don't like that Chand baliyan song at all but only that ad interrupt everytime boring song which always change my mind from listening to music and i just like to hit my phone very hard when that Chand baliyan song will comeðŸ˜•,0
I am using a premium account and the app keeps crashing. Please rectify it.,0
I can't listen to my music how do you change the song why does it change the song every time i click on the songs.,0
The platform supports (and pays VERY handsomely for) the spread of misinformation. I'll use other apps for my music.,0
Great music,1
Awesome music selection! Every day Listener!,1
I love Spotify because u can listen to any song of your choice,1
Always a great selection of ALL types on music,1
Spotify make my daily life brightly...,1
"requires the subscription to skip More them 6 songs,play the song you want,and download songs witch is bs",0
Worst podcast platform. Often just switches to something else and marks what you're listening to as played.,0
There are lots of pirated songs on this app .,0
Good music so many ads,1
"This app is good. But for some reason, The Shuffle is always on... But when the PC version comes into use, it's always off. Is the songs policy always behind a paywall or you guys just want to get money by premium... This isn't why ""Free"" streaming apps are for... The shuffle isn't helping you by you're problems.... It's just making the listener's mood and their problems unsolvable...",0
"i genuinely cannot understand who made the decision to not allow users to play samples of songs before adding them to playlists, but it makes creating playlists and discovering new music so difficult. im not sure if this is just the experience for android users or free users, but i need this feature back.",0
Been a member since it's inception and have never been displeased with the app.,1
Just soothing and enjoying the music,1
Logging in is always a hassle on both PC and mobile. It's stupid that there are no helpful articles at all and that I have to rely on luck for me to log in when I get logged out.,0
Best app in the world,1
Since the last update it doesn't show now playing or give the option to pause or skip songs. Doesn't pause with wireless earbuds or other Bluetooth devices either.,0
"i love this app because i can create 3 a.m playlist altough my account not premium, but still overall i say thanxfull",1
"I can pick my own down songs, podcasts and more!!! Love It is Just Amazazing!!!",1
"App crash at this time, not play any song",0
"I can't even listen to half my playlists because half of them don't want to save for offline, plus I'm having one other problem that other reviewers have had the same issues with, So For Goodness Sake, PLEASE FIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
Good,1
Such a nice app yeah sometimes I can't found a few song bt its ok and everything is perfect love to listen it n 1 of my most fab appâœŒðŸ»ðŸ˜‡,1
My family uses the application we love the application. But my doesn't work that well and I downloaded all my songs when I try to play my songs offline it doesn't work I don't know if it's because my table be old,0
"I'm pissed off.. Don't download this. They are greedy. If you want to play a song or a playlist, they will play you a whole different song and add random songs to it. Please remove this feature spotify and never bring it back. Uninstalling, Zuri â™¡",0
Everything is great but the music recommendations through app is literally non existent to some extent,0
"I listen to Spotify every day..at work, in my car, and at home. By far the best out there!",1
Lately very glitchy ....no fun to use....stops playing music while I'm on my bike......no control panel visible.....it has already been a way better UX,0
Great app and Spotify is the best,1
Last few days it wont let me look at my notifications or playlist. It wont let me play music at all. Its not my wifi and it doesnt tell me to check my internet connection. Its a app problem not the wifi.,0
App is amazing but after the recent update I'm unable to login to my profile. App won't open it gets stuck at the launch doesn't show any fields for email address and password. Hope they fix the bug ASAP,0
This is more better then other apps because this have all my fav song that allðŸ¤“,0
Be grateful for 1star you deserve 0,1
"Everything's okay, really really good. But I have problem about when I want to share the song to stories IG, font is so big than normal. Pls fix it.",0
"App gets killed when I try to play with bluetooth. Tried repairing, reinstall everything. Its the same. If I switch off Bluetooth it is fine.",1
"They have go a great length at making the free version so terrible, horrible, unenjoyable experience.",0
It is a very great app for listening music and you can create playlists select different artists that you like and listen to their playlists or you can search the song and listen to it,1
Superb sound quality Spotify discribed in 3 word SSQ,0
Use it almost every day at work. Gives me a good mix,1
We know there's some problems happening with the partners for the rights on songs and all. But it doesn't make sense when the songs are removed globally. Not making them available for the respected part of the place almost solves the issue. But it's problematic when most of the population is getting deprived of it. Hope this issue is addressed soon.,0
I have canceled my subscription to spotify 4 months ago and they are still taking money from my account I have tried and tried and tried to get help with this and they refuse to help... Do not waste your money on spotify....,0
"Okay, I used to enjoy this app a little over a year ago and decided to download it again... I completely understand blocking some features for 'premium' only, purposely not playing the song you click on and only allowing 6 song skips per hour is a BIT much in my opinion. I cannot afford premium- really disappointed with this.",0
I love this app and just love listening music whole day,1
Great app but they need to fix their shuffle and fix the how radio/playlist is created seems like it put in your recent songs you listen even if genre of music is completely different which doesn't make sense,0
"I'm actively compiling Playlist on another platform. Aside from sharing the opinions of Joni and Neil, Jon Mitchell's music is in all my playlists",0
Iip,1
Too many ads,0
Best streaming app.... I dont even have ads,1
It was my favourite app for music once. Now it is not a music app. It is just an app for ads. I'm fed up with your ads. You should have atleast provided the 30 minutes ad free experience.,0
"Moved over from amazon music after amazon just wouldn't play my extensive playlists over the alexa and also just on an aux in my car. Utterly frustrating when there long drives to be had to university and its my only alone time away from 2 kiddos, self care in important. Spotify has worked perfectly, the tracks it recommends are on point after only using it for a month it's got my taste down to a tea. Really user friendly, even my 5 and 9 year old can make their own playlists.",1
Good app overall. Frequent updated to clean up bugs is nice.,1
Fine with music,1
Came here exclusively for Joe Rogan. The Joe rogan experience to be accurate. Joe is great. Spotify has a decent music selection also. Interface is 4.5/5,1
Premium is good but they literally added 7 30 second adds when I'm not on premium and it's ridiculous I don't want to wait 3 and a half minutes for music I already have to shuffle.,1
Amazing!I've got my favorite songs old and new from A-Z completed. Thanks Spotify,1
"Love it! Haven't had any problem pulling up any songs,albums or concerts that I asked for. Really awesome app.",1
"This app is horrifically glitchy, especially for a paid app. I'm so disgusted with it's current state, I'm thinking of pirating.",0
Excellent variety of music and information. Recommendations for music are spot on!,1
The new update is WORSE UPDATE IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
I think the app is going downhill now there are many glitches the app will close automatically songs will stop being playing After 2 or 3 minutes and there are way many adds,0
"This app is good for playing music and listening to podcast,but it needs to download music too.We need to listen to music also offline like when you don't have data or there is load shedding.Please add this to the app too",0
Am unable to use on my ph .....it gets downloaded but unable to log in,0
I can just see a blank black screen whenever i open Spotify since 4 days now,0
"Spotify is by far the best streaming podcast the best music. I've tried Amazon, SoundCloud you name it I've tried. I have not of the present found any other streaming service that's comparable to Spotify! You guys rock!",1
"It sucks! when I go offline, my playlist wont show up!",0
Aside from the fact that this conpany continues to allpw joe rogan to broadcast lies. The app itself continues to start playing when a phone call is answered. This caused me to almost get into an accident as a call came in while i was driving handsfree but them spotify thought i needed music with my call. The app is no where to be found in my currently open apps. And killing them all didnt stop it. Get it together spotify. Make your app work correctly and monitor your content. Deleted today.,0
"Its so trash, I can click on a song, but the song that it plays will be completely different",0
I've had Spotify for over 10 years.. love them,1
I enjoy the control I have on the music I want to hear and when they play songs that is similar to what I listen to. I learn new songs that way,1
Superbb excellent,1
Audio keeps dropping out. The player controls disappear and you can't pause or skip songs. I'm paying a lot of money for this. Hope they fix it soon... Going crazy at work! Update: can't even get it to work intermittently any more....,0
"I love the choices, I find all my current Christian faves along with other pop and classics, and 80's and 90's songs I grew up with. I keep my songlists to enjoy whenever I want, and share with others. Reasonable fees for the service.",1
When I press on a song I want to hear it plays a diffrent song I don't get why.,0
"Love Spotify , it sounds awesome in my car.",1
Some features like sharing the lyrics on IG doesn't always work in android,0
Good application I love it I used to listen to my favourite music's and hip hop but you can't download free so I rate 4,1
Sensationnal to say the least. Love it!!,1
O nice music app,1
Useful,1
Love it just ads Sometime are problem And the lyrics are mismatch,0
it's a wonderful experience by using Spotify . Thank you for making my life more piece and relaxing while listenig Spotify.,1
The shuffle is so annoying pls fix it!!!,0
Get to listen to my music which is perfect,1
Why is there so many ads?,0
"Spotify is more beneficial with premium account, no adds, create your own playlist, track selection of your choice, super easy to use and reasonably priced..",1
Spotify is getting worse with every passing day.it doesn't allows to search even if we are connected to network.,0
Has anyone experience the random pausing. And now the track skipping as if it was a CD? No. Just me. Well I'm gonna have to find a different app now.,0
How is this taking more wifi for audio only while YouTube when running audio only takes far less wifi to listen to in the background??? You guys need to hire someone to optimize your code because holycow the wifi usage it requires has the podcast CHUG! It's not even as if the audio is any better than YouTube!,0
This app is vary good I love it!!!! ðŸ˜Š,1
Great platform for music,1
"I searched for a song appeared, when playing it not the song I've searched ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž",0
Great music and fun to get so much variety ðŸ˜Š I love Spotify,1
Really bad when I search up a song I di find it but it takes me through a whole Playlist and I can't skip. However when I do find the song I want I can't put it on repeat I remeber back them you could. Spotify explain,0
Such a great app for wonderful music,1
"Used to be my go-to app for music & podcasts. Then recently it stopped functioning properly. App loads but ALL playlists/podcast/etc are empty. I've done all the available troubleshooting to no avail. While it works on my PC, I never use it there. So I'll be canceling b/c no one wants to pay money for something they can't even use. So disappointed.",0
It's an amazing app and my favorite way to listen to music. The only thing that I don't like is how many features that they don't allow you to use without Spotify Premium.,1
"Not having a very well thought out options bar, having an easier way of searching for any of your songs within your downloaded music.. without seeing the online results or anything but songs or artists. Also the fact you cant remove a song from a playlist when you're on the main pop up menu of a currently playing song. Instead I have to literally scroll down my entire playlist to select remove from playlist!??? I enjoy having a streaming platform like spotify. But changes need to happen.",0
Love the variety - especially the tech podcasts!,1
I'm in love with this Masterpiece AppðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Just Awesome I'm Totally impressed ðŸ‘‘ðŸ‘‘,1
Only app worth writing a review for. Almost perfect. Now provide a visualizer for Playstation and Xbox...please.,1
1 star is more than you deserve,1
"4 out of 5 stars because there isn't much music kids can listen to. There are also many explicties I have to call out like pictures,cus words,and racial conduct. Lastly the amount of ads I get is like 4 every minute. Okay this is the real ""lastly"" even premiums get ads! Over all the rest of the app is good. Not all tik tok songs are on here soo don't try and search them up on spotify.",0
The Best streaming talk and music out there. Thank you,1
So much ti choose from with podcasts abd music. Love it!,1
The best and easiest music option,1
"I got my three month subscription last week , I had to factory reset hopefully l get my Spotify til july still",0
"Twice I have given negative reviews. One was about promoted podcast just annoyingly displayed on my screen whenever I accessed my library (premium was active). Second was about a bug that prevented my premium extension. Both were resolved, curiously, in subsequent updates. I guess the devs really read the reviews on Google Play and not telling me to go somewhere else to complain? And for that I thank you.",0
I Love Spotify radio so much!! ðŸ“»,1
Great app haven't had any problems with it. Easy to use. And has a great choice of music. Would highly recommend,1
"Spotify often gets logged off especially when we get into car and start driving, music will not work and we will have to stop and login again. Login without password functionality often does not work. Eventhough link says its valid for 4 hours, it says expired, when tried couple times, it says too many attempts",0
Constantly says I have no internet connection when I do,0
"â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸ Spotify is an amaazing app.. knowing tht.. i went for d premium.. but even aftr the payment, it is still not showing premium n still i get ads .. if anybody cud help.. pls doâ˜¹ï¸",0
"Fantastic music streaming, my favorite thing is that i get weekly recommendations on new songs",1
"The music keeps cutting out every couple of minutes on my brand new phone AND did on my previous phone. I've reinstalled and updated the app many times. What else is there to do to fix this issue? Actually, the music now stopped while writing this feedback. Lol. Smh.",0
Always enjoy hearing my podcasts and music with Spotify.,1
"I love my Spotify for the different genres and underrated artists, and just being able to quickly navigate the app. but I recently updated and noticed you can not preview songs anymore when quick adding to a Playlist. I'm really bummed about it because some music I need to listen before I add to the Playlist. Now when I find a somewhat worthy song I have to close thar page out and open the search bar ðŸ™",0
"loved this app for the longest time, but the layout changes are vile. it's hard to navigate, the shuffle and loop buttons are far too small, the play/pause and skip are so weirdly put together it's hard to use. almost no new layout updates have been good recently and i'm questioning if it's worth paying for it anymore.",0
I hope you like listening to as many ads as you do songs if not more. Do not use if you don't have premium.,1
"Great app, I'm just not into tech but I dig it, I could spend hrs listening to music I haven't heard in years. Thank you",1
"Update 5/19 â€” songs in search still will not play, nor will songs show up on playlists. I've tried all fixes for this. Please fix this issue.",0
"Very ad heavy. Add option to select the buffer size (in seconds, minutes or songs). Many people travel through areas with botchy internet signal, so after a song ends, it repeats several times until internet is restored. It would be nice to set the buffer to 3 or 4 songs.",0
This update has some minor bugs. Please fix them asap.,0
Why is playing songs that are not even on my playlist?!!,0
I enjoy listening to my favorite music anytime I want. The music plays clear and is uninterrupted! Love it!,1
Hi uhm... Spotify app is really good although the offline button does not work for me please make it work in on Android btw,1
"If the free version is terrible makes me not want the premium version. Can't pick what songs you actually want to play will only play from playlists, only 6 skips per hour when you can't even pick a direct song only shuffle play?? This isn't good marketing its just infuriating, used this app many years ago and honestly super disappointed won't be using again ðŸ‘ðŸ»",0
"I love the app, but but songs' lyrics aren't available at all. I have Spotify on my laptop, too, but I have lyrics there. I've tried to contact support, but they didn't help me Upd.: Lyrics fixed, thank you!",0
"Crashing frequently, and the play bar is going away constantly, so I can't pause or turn on different music until I close and reopen the app a few times.",0
Never works anymore on my android worked fine for a long time now seems to stop constantly or doesn't load at all.,0
"As other users also mention I am experiencing problems with the app since the last update. The song bar does not show, it is not registering that music is playing, and the music stops for no reason every 5-10min. Please fix these bugs as otherwise Spotify is a great app.",0
Recent update has ruined this app. Good UI and app was great before. Now music constantly stops and app crashes or doesn't load.,0
Synchronization between devices is the best part of the app. Too deadly!,0
"The best music app ,try premium and you will not regret it",1
"Whatever recent update has happened its wrecked it. So buggy, repeating songs, widget not responding, plays when it shouldn't, doesnt play when it should. Even plays 1 song while claiming to play something else. only solution is to force stop app and restart. So inconsistent now",0
"the excessive amount of ads makes me not want to use this app anymore. apart from that, its pretty good",0
Every music app advertising but if we are not purchasing Spotify premium It hase more love with the advertising than songs.,0
"Despite a couple recent updates, the app continues to randomly stop playing and close. Mid-song, between songs, it doesn't matter. Not acceptable for something I'm paying for.",0
Spotify decided to ruin the ap for no reson. They made the ap so when adding songs you can't play previews of the songs or even listen to theym at all untill after you add it to the playlist. I recommend trying other apps before trying this one.,0
Good enough. Sadly this is the best audio streaming service for capabilities of the platform and song library. Having Podcasts mercilessly marketed as the default is awful and the audio quality isn't good.,0
"I've been using Spotify for more than 3 years but since last 2 months, I couldn't buy premium. It always shows notification said ""unable to connect"". Please fix this. Thank you in advance",0
Personalization is their Forte love having Playlists designed just for me!!! DAILY,1
I absolutely love Spotify!!! It has all the music I love to listen to!!,1
The Ads are frustrating ðŸ˜¤ and their is a big I found when u stops the music sometimes the music slider goes back it's a good way to trap people into ads ðŸ‘ï¸ðŸ‘„ðŸ‘ï¸ . other than that I love to hear music in this app good for finding new music nd feature â¤ï¸,1
"App stability is getting worse, happens across multiple devices very frustrating.",0
"I cannot download musics even if I am using only one device. It keeps saying too many device althought I am only using one. please fix this bug, it's very irritating. It is not worth my money if its like this.",0
I dont like this app .... No one song is played in my phone ...,0
"I really recommend this, seriously, I do!! You can listen to music, comfort audios (my favorite), and even your most liked tiktok audios! Install this, I promise you it's worth it!!ðŸ˜½ðŸ˜¸",1
"Great song collection, nice features.",1
No voice control. Difficult to play greatest hits from an artist.,0
It's very nice application to play our favorite track..... ðŸ‘,1
"Still stopping mid stream on all players, all networks -my phone, laptop, and streamer at home, and my phone and work laptop on my employer's network. Spotify is properly broken and soooooo slow and unresponsive. What on earth have you done to it?",0
"I have been using Spotify premium. Biggest dissapointment is the way the app behaves when you are offline. I downloaded my playlist before my trip so I can listen to them offline. But the app doesn't let me in when I'm offline and instead takes me to the login page. Having inconsistent internet connection during the trip meant I could no longer login and access the downloaded songs. Also, when I managed to log back in later using a slow internet connection, the app tried to download all the downloaded songs again which was not possible with the limited slow internet that I had during the trip. App is not designed to be your travel companion and can be enjoyed only in home where you have proper internet connection. For travel and trips where you need offline access to your favourties playlists, Spotify premium doesn't help. Looking at other options.",0
"Good sound, easy to use, and has all of the music I love.",1
All my favorite song is here.. nice sound quality.... i always using spotify... Good job.. thumbs up for you spotify...,1
You broke it with the last update. GUI disappearing without reason. Rollback and try again,0
"It's fine apart from the amount of ads and how it adds things to your playlist. I would also love if they added more songs ESPECIALLY slowed and sped up versions. It would definitely make the platform better, and more popular.",1
Hello I'm here to update my review from last year. This app is still trash. Android is the stepchild of your development team ... No play back bar and stuttering playback. Can you please get it together or suggest to me a music streaming service that works better? I'm sick of paying for a half developed app.,0
"It's good but it's been bugging out the last few months. I'll have signal and it'll take a few minutes for a song to play; I'll close the app and open it a few hours later to my queue list being reshuffled, down to 2 songs left or just won't play so I'll have to force close and reopen. Doesn't play every song in order and jump off ""main list"" to a ""based off"" list.",0
"A few requests: - I turned ""Autoplay"" off but it still autoplays songs after a playlist ended. Restart of the app didn't help. - The artist page loads very slowly in offline mode - When you click on ""Liked songs"" on the artist page you actually also get songs that you didn't like. With that text I don't expect to see songs I didn't like.",0
It is the best app I ever seen for music but the only mistake you have made is can't download the music .so please solve this problem in the next update,0
"Besides the ads, the music quality is great, their collection of Playlist is excellent, they have lyrics and their user interface is easy to use",1
"Excellent.From the oldest to the latest,a v.extensive collection of all the music that is made in all forms.",1
Now with infinitely more ads and less music,0
"Whenever my phone goes to sleep (screen black after set amount of time) the audio will pause and play like it's got a weak wifi signal. Then when I tap on the screen or wake it up, audio plays fine. Why.",0
It's one of the best music apps.. if you like listening to podcasts and getting new songs easily then I guess Spotify is the best choice,1
"I can't find a way to reorganize my playlist. I am going to edit playlist, but there is no list of the songs so that I can reorganize it. Please fix it",0
"No doubt the best Music player for Android, imo it's even better than Imusic. thanks Spotify for giving us such an amazing quality of music with such low prices, absolute diabolical ðŸ˜",1
Always able to listen to my favorite music,1
"okay I like spotify but stop adding songs to my playlist. -update 3 years later, spotify is sooo much better w premuim and tbh its so worth it",1
"The Best music app. Better than Amazon Music, Ganna, Wync Music, etc.",1
"It is very nice not having to pay to be able to listen to music and Podcasts (I'm talking about YouTube and YouTube music, having to pay for themðŸ˜ )",1
It's my all time favorite music app.,1
"While I actually prefer the Deezer app in most aspects, Deezer doesn't have a decent Ella Fitzgerald collection which is obviously COMPLETELY unacceptable. So, I'm back to Spotify. At least they know what good music is.",0
Great place for music. But they're are not staying away from the political stuff enough either they need to choice neither side or let both sides be part. I don't like when I have to go somewhere else for the other side of the story.,0
"App has been acting up lately, intermittently pauses music when on wifi, bugs out and crashes when using Android auto. Having to restart the app several times a day to get playback to work correctly. Tried a fresh reinstall with no success. Fix your stuff, Spotify.",0
Free music as it is to buy. Listening to real recordings of artist not someone's copy or stolen mp3. Pay for no ads and listening to what you want anytime.,0
It's gotten much better. It would be nice to have a option to see if a song is on multiple Playlist,0
Best application for music..loved itðŸ˜,1
"Very giid app, almost no problems. The only Thing is that it says that i don't have any internet while all my other apps work just fine. But apart from this it is a app that works perfect.",1
"So buggy, especially when switching between listening devices. Now playing does not update to show what's currently playing. Sometimes it keeps playing even after closing the app. And it just randomly crashes for no reason. Album art doesn't load most of the time either",0
Great app all around I appreciate the app for its overall quality,1
Its a really good music app!!,1
I really like this app as you can listen offline which is perfect for listening when you're out and about and don't want to bother people with your noise,1
"Update Feb 2022: Spotify is OK with paying for Joe Rogan to lie about vaccines. That's not cool. ///Spotify service? Acceptable. Spotify app? Hot garbage. Have a slightly older phone? App slow as heck. Patchy WiFi? No music for you. Stream to Chromecast? Works 60% of the time. Want the app to, you know, work at all? Hope you like restarting your phone. Makes one wonder what they do with all that subscription money... They don't pay artists and apparently aren't spending on app developers either.",0
Greatly appreciated and thanks for this opportunity to listen ðŸŽ¶ freely,1
Bad app to many adds and always an add about spotify premium,0
This is good but some time look like server problem is in,0
Spotify>Apple music>YouTube music>deezer In 1. Ease of access 2. User friendliness 3. Accessibility,0
"I've used this for years and it's just a poor app. Managing play lists is a pain, adding all songs from an artist is a chore. Features that any music app should have are convoluted or missing.",0
This is one of the best music app in India for listening Music especially you can create your own dream playlist and then share it with your friends... Equalizer to customise the music as per your own preference... Very good affordable plans to choose for Spotify Premium... The only thing is missing is LDAC quality songs just like CD quality & this is the only feature which is missing in Spotify at the moment...,1
"It is absolutely perfect for music, when it works. Lately I have been encountering a lot of glitches like the play bar at the bottom disappearing and the playback slider not working. It forces me to close and restart the app every time. The queue will also occasionally rearrange itself and sometimes makes copies of songs in queue. Once these get fixed, I will change my review.",0
What happened to the enhance button on my liked Playlist? It just disappeared I restarted my phone even losing in and out of my account reinstalled the app and its no where to be found,0
"Why is controlling spotify on my pc from my phone so broken now, what are we even paying for?",0
I want swipe to queue like on iOS version of app Also when I'm ONLY USING DOWNLOADS it loads slowly so dumb,0
I have two stars because when i quit the app with songs the songs stop and when i am replay the song again it stops so fix it before 2 week or else you will 0 or 1 star,0
"better than Pandora, i""m a premium user for 2 years now with the old Hulu bundle, i love it!",1
"It's super good, No more wordsðŸ‘Œ",1
"I literally unhealthily love Spotify but recently it's just gone down hill :( like the lyrics just will not work for me like at all. I've done everything humanly possible to get them to work, deleting the app from internal storage, logging out/in, etc and nothing works I don't get any lyrics but I can see in my liked songs the song that have lyrics I just can see or use them. now I have to redownload 1700 songs for no reason and I am really annoyed",0
Spotify is a app were u can listen to music but YOU HAVE to have internet or it won't work and it has every music in the world and u can listen to anything u want and you can make playlist for ur friends,0
"okay listen, I don't understand why us no premium we can't, skip every song we like? You make us listen to Ads? Literally not worth it, it's good but atleast make us skip for example ""we want to play this song we do it but it's not the song we want? You play it but it's not the song we wanted update your app it sucks",0
I have a busted speaker and it is still clear and I hear the still clear,1
"5 stars -1 star for ""Allow Bluetooth?"" ""Allow Bluetooth?"" ""Allow Bluetooth?""",1
It just dosent work correctly,1
I used to love this app but since the recent update (android) It randomly stops and shuts out if this bug is not fixed soon I will cancel my premium.,0
"I'm an old granny who misses her CD player in my car. Spotify has helped me ""survive""!",0
Beautiful app Love Spotify its amazing,1
I like the old classic songs Is very easy to get it,1
"SPOTIFY is great, good music,so much to choose from",1
Can listen to music for free with ads but won't play what you pick. Good for a station I guess.,0
"I have yet to not find a song I want. I like to making my own Playlist and it makes it easy to do so. The only things I didn't like was how it has a ""skip song"" counter that goes against you. It also doesn't let you listen to your Playlist in order but randomly plays. Other than that for $10 a month for the Premium service, it's a good deal.",1
It's a great app. I would have gave 5 stars if adds were blocked on Podcasts for the premium account members.,1
I enjoy Spotify for it's ease of use.,1
"Sure it has infinate free music. But for every song there is at least 3 ads. It wasnt always this way but now it is. Instead it used to go ""click her to 30 minutes of ad free music"" but now those ads dont exsist so ur stuck with the 3 for every song. Also your ""liked songs playlist""? Completely useless. U can go to it and press shuffle play, but will it play the songs that u pressed the like button on? Nooo. It plays songs u have never heard of. Like seriously wth is that. So find a diffrent app",0
I've been using this app for almost a year now but then it just doesn't let me use the app. Please fix this problem,0
Easy to play while working in multiple other apps without pulling too much bandwidth. Rocking it with one bar in rural Texas...,1
"it's good for music -streams well, but it's constantly logging me off, it also lags quite a bit :<",0
Bugs on Samsung A50S. Turned off sometimes and cannot go to play mode when play songs from playlists,0
"Everything is fine except the pricing, I would be better to give some offers for customers to buy premium",1
Some random bug popped up on my Spotify where the music randomly stops and plays. It doesn't show the music that's playing on the notification bar or the bottom of the app.,0
Music plays for a short moment then stops. Then starts up hrs later and stops again.,0
The best thing for me. Can listen too all the music I love Also podcast and books. Couldn't do without it.,1
Keeps randomly playing music by itself!,0
"Weird UI, Make the play button the same place it was before. It's just awful now.",0
"I hope the new update fixes the plethora of bugs that plague this app (on Android). The music controls completely disappear at random Playing over Bluetooth works when it feels like it wants to Shuffle needs to have a word with a dictionary Assuming that I want my ""daily mixes"" filled with a genre of song that I played 20 seconds of Jumping from the song I've chosen to play to a random song that might be in the same playlist Takes me 150 episodes away from the podcast ep. that I'm listening to",0
This app is awful I used to LOVE it but the app won't even let me listen to musicðŸŽ¶ what is a music app when you can't listen to music!?,0
"So many bugs. Doesn't work smoothly in airplane mode, when you should still be able to listen to downloaded episodes. Also crashes occasionally.",0
"Spotify is great, there is just so many ads. Every 2 songs there are ads and I never get the 30 minutes of no ads anymore. I just wish there wasn't so many ads.",0
"I'm not very good with this kind of stuff, but I'm persevering and it's getting easier for me to listen to all my favourites and find new music, anyone with a little more brainpower will love it",1
"I have been using this app for 2 years. This is very good app with all types of music, but please do something about your ads I know if i want to get rid of ads i have to upgrade to Spotify premium but seriously 3-4 ads after every song!! (+_+)",0
"I don't like how it shuffling right now, I prefer the old way.",0
App often does not work properly and doesn't show which song is playing - this makes it impossible to pause without closing the app,0
"I dont care what you think is ""best for my playlist"" I dont want to listen to random songs I want to listen to the songs that I have in my own playlist instead of you adding in your own",0
"Good app,but adds are annoying.",0
Very good app. So many songs available. Thanks!,1
"I already cancelled my subscription in early May 2022. But at the end of the May 2022, they still deducted the subcription fee through my credit card. IT'S A TOTAL SCAM!!! I WANT REFUND!!!",0
I was wonderful but lately it's garbage so many bugs,0
One star cause i can't give 0 So bad full of unwanted songs and they force you to hear it to get to the one you actually want,0
"Exceptional app. But I've recently noticed that when you're using the free version, you won't be able to play a particular song. It may play songs related to the artist but not the particular song you intend on playing",0
Very laggy on android phones,0
"The recent update introduced 1 issue, most of my songs aren't showing up as downloaded offline even though they are. I have to pop data on for a sec to get them to register they are downloaded. This is a pain when I have poor service. This also doesn't seem to be just me, because my friends have reported the same issue",0
I love that I choose the music I listen to.,1
Great way to keep up with what's new or binge listen fav's.,1
I use the app literally daily. I have just one problem when I upload the playlist photo it will stay there until I close the playlist. Once I open it again the photo won't be there. Please let me know if there is a way to fix this. Other then that I love the app.,1
Fantastic App that understands that the right to free speech is more important than Neil Young. Bless your cotton socks Spotify. I love you.,1
I'm an artist and Spotify doesn't even let me listen to my own song. It keeps playing other songs that I don't like :)),0
Exceptional app apart from the fact that they charge you for listening to music but I guess thats their only form of making money,0
"Last update stuffed everything , keeps stopping my music and I doesn't show what song is playing ðŸ™„",0
Samsung Note 20 5G ultra. Awesome app. No problems. Easy to use,1
Keeps cutting out. Have updated the app three times and same problem. Turd.,0
Best music streaming platform . Hands down,0
Best of the best ...mostly the playlists ðŸ‘Œ,1
I have enjoyed using Spotify.,1
It's a good music app but I wish the student discounts applied to high schoolers not just college.,1
To much ad. Frustrating,0
Low ratings seem to come from the people who dont pay for it so... â­â­â­â­â­ -paid customer,0
"Features keep getting removed from the free version. You can't edit you playlist, you can't put a song on repeat, you can't put a playlist on repeat, you can't choose a song from your playlist to listen to you have to start from the beginning and it keeps asking me to go premium. At this point stop saying it's free just make it all paid for and stop pretending that your services are free at all. Making a playlisting on youtube with adblock is easier than using this app.",0
This would be great but why does Spotify tell me to watch an ad for 30 minutes of uninterrupted ad-free music and then show an ad 10 minutes later,0
Whenever I try to login I get an error,0
"Last update now doesn't work with Android auto when plugged in. It trust to transmit via Bluetooth and direct connect resulting in nothing playing, great update guys",0
I'm looking forward having the equivalent of qobuz within Spotify some day. But until then I very pleased from the app and the recommendation engine and the Playlist generated for me. Already 6 years a customer;-),1
"A few major bugs including the play/pause bar disappearing occasionally, and queues not functioning properly with duplicated/incorrect songs. (very difficult to rearrange songs across 'Next in Queue' and 'Next From') I also have an issue where if I tap on a song outside the queue, it will just play whatever is next in queue instead. Reopening and reinstalling hasn't helped",0
Welp. When I first try this. Is not that bad. But it's turn out. I deeply disappointed. I have difficult problem to playing song. I just making some playlist and I can't even click the next song if I try click the next botton and it's start playing random song- I mean is not even relate to my song I want. And second the ads ;-; I mean I know I'm not in premium but that ads is also came out mostly when you feel the music and ads came out that try premium for no ads.,0
Excellent this app was really good specially i also really like kpp sonfs so it is best for me saranghe spotify(love spotify),1
"It is actually good, however i think spotify is having a problem everytime i click the music that i want different song was playing instead of the music i want. the playlist i want is existing but different music is playing.",1
As soon as I bought spotify premium it stopped working and wouldn't let me do any of the options listed after a week of use and now it says I'm on the free plan,0
Very problematic for mobile phone users. I hope they will make it as smooth as pc used app.,0
Why take away the preview song feature? So you can make more people wanna get the paid version? Like really? How am i supposed fo find new songs if I dont have a taste of what it sounds like? Its not like reading the name of the song and artist is gonna helpbme hear the song. . . big L spotify.,0
I enjoy the music..but how to download the music,1
Great music definitely a great app to have.,1
O my my my! I been on here listening ðŸŽ¶ for about a 1/2 hour and I'm so happy!! I am ðŸ’¯ % satisfied. I am 75 years yung..lol and I'm so incredibly in love with SPOTIFY!! You have made this Sister extremely happy ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜ƒ thank you so much. I love all types of music Gospels (Slim & Suprem Angels Oldies (Jackie Wilson)..got a long way to go. Modern Gospel..R&B..Country.. Modern Jazz to name a few. Thank you,1
Can't believe I'm writing this but Spotify has horrible sound quality compared to Anghami. I tried playing the same song here and there and the distortion is clear. Arabic content is very weak. Would rather use Anghami free version and bear the ads than have the free 3 months premium offer from Spotify. Uninstalling right now.,0
"My Spotify is currently having a problem. Ever since Monday, Spotify hasn't been letting me listen to full albums. Like everytime I open an album, it just shows the shuffle button and there's no way for me to play the actual album. To the people working at Spotify, PLEASE FIX THIS!",0
"Simple to use, happy I added this happy!",1
Wishing there was a rollback option. Latest update having all the problems described in the latest reviews. Wondering if Spotify read these reviews.,0
Streaming to desktop is a wonderful feature as I use it to play music when in vr. Music selection is great and the precurated Playlist are filled with awesome tunes 10/5,1
"I don't know what you've attempted to do but today this app won't work, I've got nothing in my drop down/notification box, there's no now playing box in the app all this I can live without but I've now got to reopen the app after Â½-4 songs and press play on something else......sort it out or I'm gone",0
Overall great experience with Spotify. Concert updates song suggestions and multiple playlists to choose from. My one thing for improvement would be a pandora esq style of playlist. I like choosing a play list of a specific genre and just letting it play. With the playlist changing and updating as you like each song. Playlists like that don't exist on Spotify.,1
Lovely,1
"I love that I can add episodes to a queue and to a favorites list. That way, I can look for my next five in a single scrolling moment, and then just binge on podcast after podcast while I do my weekly full house clean! No need to stop and find another ""good one"", mid cleaning!",0
Love this app but the ads are irritating and can't listen to my fav song offline,0
It is osum but wuons you play a song you hav to go thru the hol album al over agen and you can only skip 6 songs per haewer but evry thing els is perfect,1
Has been awful for weeks now. It will just pause while listening all the time or won't load for some reason now its crashing. I'll find another streaming service. Fix it or I'm out.,0
Well changed my rating. Spotify remove some content but leave up WAP and gang music...,0
I am premium user although I can't see canvas feature on my account. I have been updating but didn't worked.,0
Spotify it's an okay app the ads are fine and it lets you know about them but the thing that pisses me the f*** off is when it's as a playlist has specific songs or I tell it to shuffle my liked songs it starts playing all of these different songs that never said were in the playlist or a place to suggested song that thinks I'd like I never like the suggested songs. Please just do what it said it's going to do and play what it's going to play it annoys me when I wanna hear asong and hear another,0
I am writing this review after using this app. Love this app . It don't show you advertisement. Just enjoy the music without ads.keep it up Spotify.,1
i would have given five stars but its four cause of the adds there are allot of adds,1
Outstanding database of music. Like the lyrics feature. Looks of flexibility to create play lists.,1
i love spotify bt it sounds little low than other song apps pls fix this..,0
Nice app there are so many songs but I have 1 problem the problem is ads I think that it will show only 1 ad but no it show 5 ads in 1 time,0
"After updating the app it removed my downloaded songs on the list of the albums that I saved. That's 350 songs that I needed to download again. It happened when I close and reopen the app. Please fix it, app also crashes sometimes and cannot load my other songs that I downloaded.",0
I filled my life,1
Hate the offset play button all the way on the left...,0
Better off using web player. This app on a chromebook is unstable and always crashes every time I open it. It launches and then fails so I have to close the app and open it again.,0
Really awesome... High quality everything looks good no negative review...enjoy through Spotify,1
"Actually it's good, but the ads when your enjoying but the ads",1
Interface blows and is super inconsistent. No idea why their is separate playlist and now playing list or que. Hate that I have to hide songs uncertain types of playlists and I can't just down vote them,0
"Ive had spotify premium for years and love the app. However the last year its been riddled with bugs that range from slightly annoying to bugs that i have to restart my phone and they seem to mostly be around OS updates, but even some spring up on their own. So im not sure why its been so bad lately but its ridiculous, i dont pay for premium to deal with an app thats riddled with bugs, and makes me switch to another music app",0
"I can't search for any songs, it's always showing no internet when in cellular data roaming (ON). Can only use in wifi.",0
"The latest update is full of bugs. I preferred the previous interface, not sure what was intended with the interface change, the cast functionality is not synching correctly between devices and sometimes the app does not simply respond when trying to pause, forward, rewind, etc. Desktop app sometimes just stops to work at all.",0
"There's this bug where sometimes if you click on a song, it will play a different song.",0
"When you pay its 5 starts easy, but if you dont then it's literally the worst app and you may aswell download soundcloud",0
Good,1
Nice app,1
The new update is brutal. Never using this again.,0
Very easy interface and not glitchy at all work great in old device but the musics dont have high bass. at some point there is no bass at where it should be other than great app,0
WHY ARE YOU PLAYING A SONG THAT ISNT IN MY PLAYLIST. LIKE CMON I DONT MIND IF I CANT SKIP A SONG BUT DONT PLAY A SONG THAT I DIDNT ADD TO MY PLAYLIST,0
Needs music to available in HD. Other music service can do it. Come on Spotify.,0
I love bc when you premium you can do a lot of things and the music's unlimited there's not all the music that you want but there's most of it and if you can't find a song you're looking for you type up the lyrics and other people have made albums with the music in the album,1
Great music ðŸŽ¶ app.,1
"It would be nice for it to let me hide certain sections of content, or even let me disable them, to save bandwidth and keep the app focused on what i want/need. Would also be nice for it to have a song recognition system to avoid having another app for this purpose. Keep improving it. Thanks!",0
Very good app and always has classics.,1
"Horrible and SUCKS suddenly when i listen on my phone. Inserting songs into my Playlist that I've never added anywhere. Won't let me listen to my Playlist at all, or only hear snippets. If I try to skip through, I can't because I get the pop-up to buy premium. THAT'S NOT MOTIVATING ME TO BUY PREMIUM. Jesus, just fix it.",0
"im on premium right now, so it doesn't suck for me (yet). i would suggest making a feature to where you can skip to a time in the song through the lyrics (just by pressing on the lyric). it'll save me time for when i want to show a specfic part to a friend. thanks lol",0
I used to love Spotify but the aggressive way it's trying to force podcasts on me and the horrendous way it makes other other artists pretend to be more well known names is bloody frustrating.,0
It's been awhile since I've had a great time listening to music,1
i love this bc it sooooo awesome and i can listen to my own music without my sibling knowing what ilisten to,1
Can someone please fix the problem that has been occurring over the last few weeks? Music stops playing and the play bar is gone and sometimes I can't play a song.,0
"Please add local playback support for WearOS. I solely use Spotify for music at this point and have had premium for a few years. The app works great but I just got a Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and am disappointed to find I can't play music out of the watch speaker. Sometimes it glitches and WILL play through the watch so obviously it does work, but isn't accessible on demand. Otherwise ðŸ‘",0
"It's not great to use on phone, I've got to say. I can't disable shuffle and on a free plan I get up to 6 skips per hour (?) which is real fun when 5 out of 10 songs playing from my created playlist are suggested by spotify, aka NOT CHOSEN BY ME. Even marking songs to be hidden from playlists, they just get suggested again. I sometimes spend half the time listening to stuff I don't want to hear... on mobile data no less...",1
Love to have an easy explicit toggle. Great overall. Plays random things sometimes and I'd like to not scroll through settings to make sure I don't play inappropriate stuff with kids in car.,0
Really buggy on Samsung galaxy S21 fe we lose all media control after a while and no way to stop songs unless I force close the app the customer care gave me a vague reply asking me to contact Samsung to fix an issue,0
"Spotify itself is ok, I'm having problems with blootooth,,so when playing in car,,,and I switch off car and walk to my front door, it starts playing on my phone, I've tried uninstall a few times,,switch off phone a few times,, but its still a problem,,seriously thinking of cancelling monthly subscription",0
A bit buggy when it comes to downloading individual songs and playing all songs by one author,0
Why did the new update break the app. I can't play any songs. Closing and opening the app shouldn't be a solution. It constantly doesn't work and it's frustrating. Idk why my local files keep finding themselves on my liked when i turned off the future and turned off media and file permissions. I've deleted the app several times and it keeps doing it.,0
Great music and great experience,1
I just wanted to addres that i think it will be nice if we could listen to music offline,1
"Gives you the ability to listen to a plethora of music artists and genres. For a monthly subscription you can disable the advertisements. Good value for money, I'd reccomend this app.",1
When I first open the app music won't play. The only way I can fix it is by logging out than in. It's very annoying especially when I pay for premium. Please fix this soon and I'll put 5 stars back.,0
The app is good. Can make a selection list itself,1
It's good to listen music,1
The app is amazing but i can't pick the songs i want to listen to because its shuffling for me,0
Great music app. Love the podcasts,1
Will stay the best music app forever!,1
Ads in premium podcasts? Tsek! Can't click on the widget to load the app. Podcasts take forever to load. I have to use Castbox while waiting for Spotify to load. Crazy.,0
"It works well, and stores your music.",1
"I thought Deezer was bad but Spotify I can't even login, keeps saying you're offline when I'm definitely online. I can't be stressing my brains just to access music, I'm out",0
Its amazing but when I'm trying to listen to my music there are random songs I didn't want and I don't like on the list.,0
"i love Spotify but omg please fix your app lol. whenever I open it recently (z fold 2 oneui4.1) it just completely freezes up, forcing me to restart the app at minimum two times before it works. super frustrating and makes me hate using this app on mobile lately.",0
Love everything about Spotify. Premium family or Duo. Something for each individual or family!! Use it â­â­â­â­â­,1
Always switches to a dumbed-down car mode whenever I start driving and disables many features. Can only arrange playlists track by track making this feature completely redundant. App has become hard to navigate with the changes to the layout. Needs some clean rap playlists I can jam to at work.,0
It changes to a random song a song that I don't even care about and then I have to just play a different thing which then it's going to do that the same way and I really wish you could just keep it the shuffle play that I do even if it's not unlike song stop switching the dumb thing I recommend no one doing this I hate it,0
Spotify is very nice app I liked very much,1
"It was fine for the first year I had it, but now whenever I try to listen to music on it, it stops every song around the 11 second mark. I have the songs downloaded and everything, it shouldn't be my internet connection.",0
Where did the fast forward button/play bar go?,0
"Newly glitches , have been a customer for years but lately it's been unusable. Stops playing continuously then out of blue will start playing for no reason when the app Is not in use. I'm paying for an unsatisfactory product. Fix or I'll delete !",0
Some of the songs and their respective lyrics weren't there but still the best app to listen the music online....,1
"Randomly stops with Bluetooth earbuds. No matter what (restarting, uninstalling and installing etc), it seems there's a ten minute timer on Spotify just suddenly stopping whatever I'm listening to",0
I'm only giving it a 2 because I pay for the premium and I'm having problems with my android app. It's saying there is no internet connection with WiFi and mobile data but I am online. I've tried everything including uninstalling and reinstalling.,1
Best music app for me. It's a whole experience with Spotify,1
Amazing,1
I do not like how you add your own music to the ones I add to my liked music then I have to skipp threw then to get to mine,0
Really good but it's just ads but that's normal,1
"For now, they stand against leftist censorship. Either way, easy to use, and inexpensive for unlimited stuff. Good app",0
Marvelous,1
So Nice,1
I'm loving this app lots of music to choose from and lots of podcasts.,1
"Stop adding song to my playlists. Leave my playlists alone. I don't want any help selecting songs that I like. I don't want to pay for your service because your app is overwhelming, too many recommendations. I am scared to sign up because I don't want my play lists messed with and be paying for this frustration. If I pay for service, will you stop adding songs to my play lists? Do you have tech support?",0
"Ads in Spotify exclusive podcasts have too many issues. Sometimes they go on for 5 ads in a row (often repeating themselves), other times the app registers your episode as played after an ad break and you have no way to know where you actually were in the episode. Clearing cache, logging out and back in, and uninstalling and reinstalling are not acceptable as fixes. Worst podcast experience.",0
Very good,1
Speed of music on this app keeps changing when using earbuds.,0
We can only hear the music while online But in offline we can't for that we should pay money that's not nice so I rate this app 4 only,0
Really nice and useful. I think it is better than any other music app ðŸ‘you all should try it once,1
There is so much stuff that's annoying with stotify I can't play the song I want cuz it goes to something completely different,0
"Wonderful, fantastic, excellent!!! Couldn't be any better!!! The Made For You is amazing! It widens your musical horizon!",1
Best app I have down loaded any Song I ask for I get. Awesome .,1
"Ok, the app is great.i enjoy the music so much.but for the last two weeks I can't log in into the app.it would so helpful if u can sort out this situation. Thank you.",0
Absolutely crazy amazing. Spotify primume really makes the change.,1
Really appreciate and enjoy the music,1
"Would love Android auto hey Google assistant voice commands to like or unlike a hearted song. Also not paying $79.99 for a ""Car Thing"".",0
I love that you can make your own playlists,1
"Its generally a really good app to use for listening to music, however sometimes when I'm listening to my liked songs, some random songs start to play and there's nothing I can do about it. This problem is only on mobile for me",0
I love you,1
"Love listening to podcasts like Joe Rogan and Modern.Finance Edit: removing podcasts, not cool, uninstalled Spotify and I use tidal now",0
Love it although having trouble with not being able to play one particular album and cannot resolve it.,1
Your premium is nice ,1
"Since the latest update it keeps freezing. If you try to resume play, the bar displaying the song is gone and can't be fixed unless the app is restarted. Unacceptable for a product I'm paying a subscription for",0
Fantastic. I was able to listen to old and fantastic but forgotten songs. Highly commendable.,1
This app has all of the music you want and TikTok music,1
"Whatever you've done, it's terrible. Nothing loads anymore. Samsung s9",0
I like spotify its the only music app that I know that keeps playing while you go out of it and do other things. I love that plus for whatever reason you don't have any service just change it to offline and you still can listen to your music. I would recommend spotify to anyone. Well worth the money.,1
Improvement to use slow internet connectin and use low mb,0
This is the app have been looking for. I was left behind in music. Thanks. Keep on updating us with all kinds of music. Much love from @wrongsample,1
App sucks. Constantly kicks off. Junk.,0
Love the music choices I have made. Oldies good oldies.,1
"This last update really messed up my Spotify, now when I go from my vehicle to my house it continues to play and the only way I can get it to stop playing is to FORCE CLOSE the app. Ridiculous,!! I pay for this why are you messing the app up! Stop it! If it isn't broke, don't fix it!!!",0
"Love the app but it could be better if I could mass place songs. Like, if I wanted to put a song on multiple playlists, or multiple songs on playlists, I should be able to do it all at once instead of one at a time yk.",0
I LOVE THIS APP YOU GET TO LISTEN WHATEVER YOU WANT so that why I give 5 star,1
i like using spotify because i find all my favorite songs in it and other things that may please everyone but the only problem is that it needs wifi and you can't skip just 5 times per hour ..but i still like it,1
"Still nice, but the user experience is declining. Deprecated support for JVC (aftermarket) radio is absolutely unacceptable. Youtube has a better user experience in terms of discovering new music, how come the Spotify algorithms keep missing the mark?",0
Used to be great. Getting 2-3 long ads every song (even if just skipping it) frustrated me into switching to a much less annoying competitor.,0
"I've always used this and never had a problem but just recently found a lot of bugs in relation to the performance of the app (so many crashes, takes long time to load, and sometimes just stays on the android splash screen and have to reset) when changing music it is slow in playing, album covers barely load and also sometimes stops randomly- other people I know and in the reviews are having the same problem and it needs an immediate fix! ** edit most crashes were fixed in May security patch",0
Prince Kumar Motihari,1
"Hey spotify, humor me. Imagine someone doesn't want to connect their device to every Bluetooth device in a 500km radius. And stop reminding me every time I unlock my phone. Other than that it's fine.",1
"Full of ads, after every couple of songs",0
I really enjoy using the app. It is convenient as it bring you Playlist from all over the world.,1
Easy to opporate and the pmaylist it matches up foe me r spot in what i wanted to hear. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,0
One of the good and coolest points is the variety and type of music ðŸª…ðŸª…,1
The only downside to this app is the ads if you don't pay for premium.,0
"I love listening to music (I use it as a coping mechanism), so I love Spotify so much too. But, about 3 days ago (?), my Spotify wouldn't load, it would just stay on the spotify logo screen thing. Tried installing it and uninstalling it for 5 times, restarted my phone 2 times, cleared the cache/data for about 8 times, and I still can't open it (also waited for an hour for it to load).",0
Good selection of music.,1
App keeps crashing every time I open it,0
"The app is lagging continuously, which is quite annoying. Right now, every time I open the app, i can play music but don't see the bar at the bottom, same when I go to my home screen. I need to open it a few more times before it appears, and it's getting on my nerves.",0
Looks like there have been a ton of updates and bug fixes since my last review. I use Spotify all the time now and couldn't be happier with it :),0
This app is the absolute worst. Why pay for premium and your user cant even access music from the app without it crashing daily or freezing altogether?,0
"Pay $11.99 for a premium membership. Mixes the same 20 songs in various different ""Daily mixes"". Every now and then will have a single New song. If you play that app has no similar songs/suggestions. Plays one song only! So you need to go back and choose a playlist for those same 20 songs! So annoying while you driving. Same story of you search for a song. No similar songs to continue playing music. Going back to YouTube music after this month!",0
The app keeps crashing and the play bar disappears then I can't pause skip nothing cause it causes my controls in my work truck to stop working but I close the app for a few min to get it to work properly agian and I listen daily I'm pay for it to work properly not to give me issues like this if it keeps happening I'm going to have to find someone else,0
This app was great untill now that it plays songs and breaks for reasons I don't know. Please you should look into that.,1
Love this app! Works great! Premium is worth it. Don't remember a time before haha,1
It is so amazing. I have a liked song list and it is mostly country other than like 2 or 3 songs and I just hit country and it plays only country,1
Um the playing screen don't stay on...,0
Superb best music app out by far ,1
Utter garbage. One of my most buggy apps. Constantly crashes. And when I say constantly I mean once every hour at least. If I wasn't getting this for free from family it would not be on my phone. Get your ish together Spotify developers.,0
"Was awesome for years until this last update. Can't use now playing, or the next button in my car. It randomly boots up and starts playing or shuts down. Will gladly update review when issues are fixed.",0
All the music I want is available here. The play lists are wonderful too.,1
"Amazing music selection , my only wish is that they allowed you to adjust the bass, and such in the player",1
Music keeps on stopping for no reason. Downloaded playlists as well,0
Spotify is a wonderful app I have been using it and haven't had any problems with it,1
"Im so glad this app exist I dont really care about the ads, so many songs are in Spotify!",0
I can't listen to my music and I have to pay with is unfair and recommend do not download. I always have to listen to other music they recommend but they all suck. It's better to just hear music on youtube,0
What the hell I have it for a few days and there's a new update please fix it let ik go back to normal its stressing me out I want to listen t omg songs plssss fix it I'm begging you,0
"I like to have access to so much music but It doesn't play the entire playlist, it stops and then goes back to the first song or jumps to other song from another playlist. Not recommended if you like to workout with music because it will interrupt your rythm.",0
I like the large music library. To choose from.,1
"Nothing was problem to me about the ads popping in the free version but the only problem in ads is that i get it in hindi. Atleast give ads in the language that i prefer, hindi imposition here tooo???",0
I loved the app when i first got it now it won't play a song without you listening to a album please fix this or i might go back to pandora,0
Was good but was highly disappointed when they added several options when it came to accessing playlists where under the playlist menu you get a selection of random songs from random playlists. I wanted playlists not random songs from all my playlists,0
"Awesome app, great selection to choose from and Playlist recommendation is great based on your listening habits",1
Hasn't worked on my phone since the last update. Doesn't recognize any of my playlists or saved podcasts. Will open the home screen but when I select something to listen to I just a blank screen with a green spinning wheel. Used to work great before Feb 8.,0
For whatever reason I can't scroll to see the different genres/moods for my liked songs.,0
I love Spotify because you can personalize your own list and get the songs that you want to hear played whenever you want. You're absolutely great and if I had the money I would upgrade.,1
Once you figure it out it becomes easy to use. Needs personalized ads though.,0
Lately the app has been very buggy and the pause/play bar at the bottom disappears and I have to restart the app to pause or skip to the next song. I hope this issue can be promptly resolved as it is quite frustrating for an app I spend a lot of time using.,0
His app is not working . When ever I play a song . Then the close. Please do something.,0
It's a lot different from Pandora I can actually make my own playlist send them to friends I can listening to podcasts and everything. Overall good app but you really need to fix Those ads I got 11 in a row before I was allowed to listen to my music and then after listening to two songs I got 16 in a row so you really need to fix that ad problem.,0
Nothing bad to say. New custom playlists every week and playlist can be collaboritive or private. In my opinion paying for premium is def worth it.,0
Its crashing whenever i tap the play button the app closes automatically,0
It i very nice but the problem is rh ads if u tey removing few ads i would rate 5 stars,0
Nice app,1
Spotify should be able to download on Mac but its not,0
Sometimes I can't listen to the music even tho I have a subscription,0
"Pop up ads on the Premium ""ad free"" subscription are a constant intrusive nuisance. Interface is getting increasingly bogged down with rubbish recommendations that are clearly paid for by labels. Furthermore, the fact popular artists are leaving in droves due to their business practices leave you questioning why you won't leave for Apple, who at the same price and with better functionality actually treats artists with a modicum of respect. Used to love Spotify but now actively despise the brand",0
Player is disappearing randomly so you cannot pause or move to next song on Pixel 6 pro. Please fix asap.,0
Can only play a preview of my liked songs and it's the same in any playlist I make and if I want to hear a full song then I can only press the shuffle button and hope.,0
It's a good streaming platform but they really need to understand that not all of us have the money to get premium. It's really irritating to get three ads after every two songs. Atleast space them out properly that's all.,0
"Suddenly Spotify won't support Kenwood, JVC or Alpine car radios. I was informed the company has no intention of fixing this problem. I bought a $1000 radio with Spotify built-in then Spotify discontinued functional support for it. I am really quiet pisses me off. Spotify you need to fix this! I have paid your $10 a month for years. This is the thanks that you gave me. Subscription! $10 a month and can't get customer service or good service ðŸ™„!",0
"Was a good app until the most recent update. Now it randomly stops during playback frequently(every 2-3 songs) and won't even display the song I was playing so I have to find it again. I have to basically restart the app every couple of minutes to play any music. Honestly, will cancel my subscription if this isnt fixed soon. It's unusable.",0
The app just close on its own whenever I press play. Please fix this.,0
Disaster Cant repeat and play one by one song without subscription I will Never reinstall this app Also strongly recommend everyone to uninstall it,1
"They still haven't fixed a glitch they noticed nearly 5 YEARS ago. My playlists keep getting stuck on shuffle play. I tap the first song and the next song I hear is 12 songs down. Big problem with a mood playlist curated to bring me down from an anxiety attack to a calm, stable mood to an upbeat mood. Here's a useful bit of info, upbeat songs can make anxiety attacks much much worse. But it's not like you guys didn't promise to fix this in 2018 or anything. How're my monthly dues treatin ya btw?",0
Chandwaliya song is a hectic man...stop its advertisement... hearing it for the thousand time is as hell...,0
"I mean, it's a great app to listen songs with but there are some issues going on. When I play songs, I couldn't rewind a certain part of it though I was able to a few days ago? Why is it that the shuffle buttons are gone like, the buttons where if you tap it, it'll replay the same song? This app is confusing, seriously. I just want to listen to songs that's it.",0
Great app. Far better than anything apple offers.,1
Love ,1
Aahh this app is amazing I love it the song quality is very good it be like we listen that song in reality I love the song the song quality and the things is I thank you Spotify team you also bordast k pop music ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ u have great work and hard work thanks for Take my feedback I also want to say Spotify team is best and Spotify is great app for listening music is MP3 ðŸ’œðŸ’œâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ love you all Spotify team â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ have nice day ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ‡ May God bless you all ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•,1
The weird left hand side update is awful!,0
"Pretty glitchy, I always have some issue. Sometimes the song doesn't show up, it things I have no internet when I do, song doesn't change on my screen when it's playing on a different device and am still connected to the device. Poor effort when paying premium.",0
"Everytime I try to listen to my music in order (not shuffled) it won't let me I don't have any choice to listen to my playlist in order,there be random music that I don't remember adding in my playlist playing.And you literally have to buy premium just to skip music",0
Bug: Application asks for Bluetooth access again and again.,0
Good but so many ads,1
State West,1
Thus app is glitchy. Lag time is atrocious and when I'm driving in a car I can't get video. Most of the time it will kick me off my JRE podcast and when you go back you can't find out where you were. It loses your place. Needs work to say the least.,0
"doesn't show a song is playing when it is, and has been awful with Amazon echo. a song can be playing and nothing will show on Spotify",0
Worst app to many advertisement .. premium amount to pay and download .. to much commercial app,0
Supporting misinformation I'd bad for everyone. The app also lacks a random play all button which seems pretty basic.,0
Constantly cuts out podcasts and only shows playing song about half the time good for music but alot of bugs,0
"The app is buggy, not playing music while taking my subscription fees",0
"We need a ""play last"" option to add a song in the queue. Pleeeeeeeese",0
"Giving back the 5 star rating i gave for this app before. Since, the issue had been fixed and now Spotify works perfectly fine ðŸ’—ðŸ’—",1
"i really like it! also the discount for university students is really nice! I have nothing bad to say about it, it works really well for me and if it keeps like this then I'm definitely gonna be using Spotify for the rest of my life hahah",1
"Cannot cancel premium user via the app, which is a big hassle. Should add the option to opt out of the subscription via app. You just milking out people.",0
"I would reccomend this app if u like listening to music,podcasts and more .",0
Lagging with screen off. No now playing console in app.,0
Super music  app,1
Good app for listening songs ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ Thank you ðŸ™ðŸ™â¤ðŸŒ¹â¤ðŸŒ¹,1
Like it cause it's the whole package deal in one single app where u get all different kinds of music from deep house music to hip pop and my favorite amapiano,1
best music app I've had...they have all the songs from each genre that i like to listen to and new songs that I enjoy!,1
The only problem I have had was that sometimes I would play a song and a random song would start playing. But overall it's very fun and useful especially because you can exit the app and still hear the music unless your on an app that uses audio. Great app definitely recommend,1
"it's alot of tons of music that I like but the fact I want to download it,it's just so annoying I can't download some music even youtube so it's pretty useless at all.",0
"Gives you a few of skips, huge catalog. Can go off artist selected after 15 songs",0
I love Spotify music I can find all of my music that I love music that I grew up with with my sisters and brothers and my mother and father,1
"In support of its stance against cancel culture, I switched my music subscription to Spotify from Amazon music.",0
I have learnt so much I did not know by reading the write ups about the artists!,0
I love the songs and i love the singers sing thats why im giving it 5 stars,1
This is the only music streaming service I use!,0
This is very fantastic app and many types of song here,1
"I love Spotify, but lately its been running really slow and buggy. Almost unbearable",0
"Inconsistent function. Sometimes Pressing a song in search once will play it, sometimes it won't. Deleting search entries doesn't update in real time. Lock screen player freezes and doesn't show correct song playing. Disappointing by spotify.",0
"If you arent going to pay for premium, dont bother. If you dont listen to a lot of music, just use soundcloud or download mp3s. Being able to download songs from your computer onto your phone through spotofy is way too peak though. Recommended for PASSIONATE music LOVERS not recommended for normal people.",0
"For podcasts this simply isn't good enough. Buggy, not loading correctly reliably, plays completely on its own with the app closed, no offline use when you can download the podcast. Glitchy play buttons, worst in the market for me. Shame i'm being forced to use it for JRE.",0
Interface must be improve. It is not userfriendly.,0
Most convenient navigation of any music app I have found. I use it often for calming background music while working. Thank you!,1
"I love Spotify ,I have been listening to all my favourite songs on this application but there have been a problem as soon as iam trying to play a song the application is shutting down by itself. Please fix this problem",0
Easy good complex and complete.,1
I really love this app but tooooooooooo many ads which is very irritating ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
Not cheap but its worth it! Great music app! â™ª,1
I absolutely love Spotify it takes me back to the music that I listened to the most back when I was younger.,1
Such a good app I mean what's wrong about it you have a repeat playlist so you can listen to your favorite songs but one thing add more skips plz Spotify well by adding more skips still a five stars ðŸ¤©,1
"This app is very easy to use and all features are perfect and very understanding ,I always get all types of songs which are not available in other apps because I have use other apps before but after using Spotify I get the best app for music and nothing keep going. I purple ðŸ’œ U!!!",1
Please add voice search option in spotify and add video songs,0
"I have been using Spotify for months now , and trust me it is a really good app for music. But what stopped me from giving it a five star is that , sometimes , while i am listening to songs and go on another tab , let's say Google , to search something , the app automatically gets closed and i have been having this issue from a long time now. I hope the team can help me if there is any setting to do something with it. But overall , it is a good app for music and i would totally recommend it.",1
Best music app by far! And I just absolutely LOVE the Daily personalized tunes...ðŸ’¯â£ï¸,1
Can't install it..stuck at 64 even tho I have space in my phone.. Spotify app is in my mom phone and the app is amazing keep up the good work!,1
It's usually great but today it keeps cutting out and stopping,1
Good audio play experience with spotify.,1
Lacking in podcast side of it. They keep wanting to buy up the rights to podcast but put no money into the app to support them. I live in a rural area and the podcast dont auto download the new episode for offline listening. The music side is spot on.,0
This app says it's free and it is after 3 days it starts to play other music not on your Playlist. I like different types of music but now I have to endure spotifys selections of music. I do not like rap and modern music .I am older and like the music I grew up with. For 3 days I have waited for my music and nothing. I know this is done so you pay for it but they should have told me that all the time I spent downloading songs to my Playlist was for nothing unless I pay.,0
Ads should be limited,0
I would like that the app have more songs in the menu like no just Playlist more songs recommendations,0
Recently been glitching and crashing more than ever.,1
Worst app ever... I am clicking on the song which i want to listen but any other song is being played every time.,0
"i love it so much. premium is worth it guys,, and im promoting 2 pods bere, banter with sapnap n karl jacobs n sounds fake but okay. i llove spotify <3",1
"I have had Spotify for 3 years, i bought the premium and paid for 2 months, I got my new phone and canceled my premium, MULTIPLE times and it's still been charging me, I canceled because I was deleting the app since it's been pausing by itself while I'm trying to listen to my music and no matter what I do, it never fixes",0
"I love it soo much and I will rate it a 4 star, the problem is that there are constant ads, and the singing option near the lyrics doesn't seem to appear for me anymore",0
Awful. Never works just plays random songs,0
"Ads over ads, over other ads, on top of some more ads, under other ads. only 6 skips per hour. have to trial songs in order to hear what I like. Your to gready and it shows. Not for me , good bye",0
Been using Spotify as my primary source for streaming music for roughly 8 years now. I've even started my own channel. Only one thing I can't figure out how to delete a private Playlist,0
The last update of Spotify is totally sucks. I can't played all my favorites music anymore if im offline and all my downloaded playlist is totally gone. What happened Spotify fixed all the bug and changes and all the mess you done. And its restricted the plan even you pay premium. Please back the old update. I loved the application but this is very disappointed and frustrating. Im using Spotify from the start and paying premium every monthly.,0
"Easy to use, but quality is steadily declining. So many glitches. All of the sudden I can't turn it off or open the podcast I'm listening to, happens A LOT. And the fact that they don't pay the artists and content creators makes it so, even with a premium subscription there's adds in almost every podcast. That said. Very easy to use and the biggest selection in the world, so I'm keeping it for now.",0
Good,1
"IT IS SO GREAT EXPERIENCE THAT I AM ALWAYS ON CLOUD NINE .SUCH QUALITY OF MUSIC ,NEVER,EVER HAPPENED IN INDIA.SPOTIFY IS THE WEST.",1
All songs available in the app very nice,1
Great sound and the way a person can build a playlist fantastic!!Superb!!,1
"I love Spotify. My only complaint is the requesting of songs or not uploading whole albums. Spotify if you're reading this pls upload ""So Nice"" by Leroy Hudson. Thx",1
It's an amazing music application. Its having all latest music.,1
Im a premium customer for years now. Whatever is going on with the app needs to be fixed asap! There is a problem with app for fully actualizing and there's no way to control the music as the widget does not show up. I've tried reinstalling and signing in and out and there's no fix. I dont want to switch to another music vendor. Please fix this!,0
"loving it can live with the ads so not subscring....yet! Ok subscribed, family plan. Very much worth it!",1
"Was Great, but now buggy. I cannot pause music anymore.",0
This was a very food app until i used it in the first but after sometime i couldnt listen to individual songs that was very vexing because i had to go through the whole playlist,0
Before ads will be occurring once 30 mins but now ads occur for every 2 songs played......makes such a nuisance to music lovers. Need to improvise this,0
I love to play Spotify ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š ðŸŽ§,1
Great app love Enhanced option on playlists but hot bar at bottom of app dissapears sometimes.,0
"Currently app is completely broken, playlists are all empty",0
"It has a massive collection of songs to choose from and great suggestions for what ever type of music you like, plus it has podcasts which can be very enjoyable to listen to, I strongly recommend it if you enjoy music.ðŸ‘",1
"Latest version (Mar 30th) is really buggy. Songs skip over wifi. Tracks aren't shown while playing. Playlists don't load properly, and car mode doesn't work. Whatever they changed, they need to revert the build and thoroughly test before releasing again.",0
Good app. My friends make killer playlists so 70% of this 5star review belongs to them ;),1
I just love Spotify ðŸ¤©ðŸ’“,1
Too Many Ads (4/5),0
Thank you Spotify you are definitely better than the rest.,1
My Spotify app is showing a ton of music from others countries. I need American music. How do I fix that?,0
Every one should use this app for traveling . Songs play without any disturbance like adds an all,1
"Ehhh, does the job on the phone but having issues with offline listening, seems like i need reception to access my downloaded music, which really defeats the purpose. And i hope im not the only one , but functionality on my gw4 classic is basically none.even after many resets,redownloads, and a new e-sim",0
"It is a very usefull app while your travelling,it can be played even your area's is poor",0
It's a good app for music lovers.,1
Me and my friend cannot seem to make a blend playlist. The link just redirects us to the home screen of the app regardless of the link sender,1
After latest up podcasts stop randomly for no reason. Continually having to restart them.,0
I mirror the feelings of many on here. Used to be the best app available for music and in the last few months it's taken a huge nosedive down. Songs stop randomly. Sometimes even playing a song and the controls to stop it completely disappear. Only way to stop it playing is to restart your phone or delete the app! Please fix it or the next delete will be the last. This is a premium well paid for service that can't provide an app that barely functions!,0
"Its the best music app when you have premium, I personaly like it",1
Seriously? Are u that greedy for money? Your app is really doing anything annoying and stupid so we can buy your premium this app I the worst I'd rather just listen and stream on YouTube. I don't think people would want an App that's drooling for money and wasting their time.,0
"New update has ruined app. Can't pause playback outside of app anymore. Often stops playback for no reason. Click to play one podcast or song and it will randomly start playing another. Won't load downloaded content when there's no Internet connection, which defeats the object of downloading things. Also I really dislike the new display of my library, it makes it much harder to find podcasts I want to listen to. All of this was fine before the update, please fix!",0
Music skip a lot not a good app to workout.,0
Really loving it n keeps my mood always ðŸ’¯,1
"Sensoring, removing and adding trigger/misinformation warnings is GARAGE! Hopefully Joe Rogan leaves...he's the only reason why I use this platform.",0
I use thos app every day for podcasts & music. It's rare to have any trouble with it.,1
"Everything is good, but for someone who is going to have premium some other day, it's just a hell. Stereotypical, repetive ads are so annoying. It's not about ads, it's about their annoyance.",0
A good music streaming app,1
Good but too much ads,0
"I love the app , it's filled with all my favourite songs but the ads between, i hate em. So, shove your ads in ur as.",0
Worst app very slow loading ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
"I can't listen to previews of songs anymore when I'm looking for music to add to my Playlist. This feature made it easier to find songs I liked, I don't understand why it was removed.",0
"Sound quality is awesome, I am facing payment issues.",1
Just the greatest app to listen to music ðŸŽ¶ðŸ˜‚,1
It's a great app but you can't listen to one song and the adds are really annoying and I'm not paying for premium when I can just get a better app that doesn't have adds,0
Never versions seems to Bug out and close itself occasionally.,0
I have found all BTS songs that's why I rated it with 5 starsâ™¥ï¸ðŸ‘,1
Latest update moved playback controls to a suboptimal location and it's horrible! Also have issues with songs not pausing or skipping to the beginning when I use the respective controls.,0
It doesnt play the songs that you want to listen to it just does a different song you click on,1
Almost every track is available but the ads...,0
Fantastic App. So far I found every track and album which I searched. Can't imagine why I did not start using Spotify earlier. Thouroughly enjoying the vast selection of music...,1
Mostly good service paired with a broken app. It is buggy as all hell especially offline on PC where it perpetualy reinstalls it's self then says it's ran into an issue.,0
"New update is trash. Player at the bottom is nowhere to be found so you can't skip, select previous song, and pause what you're listening to. All of these are functions even the most basic music player has. We're paying a monthly subscription here, fix the bug, your app is useless right now.",0
"This is one of the best app for leastining the song. In this app the haryanvi and Punjabi song lyrics are not in Hindi, its lyrics are in haryanvi and Punjabi. But the other app like resso any language song lyrics are available in Hindi, and this is the main drawback (demerit) of this app for music lovers. Thank you â£ï¸",1
"It's great, buy why so many ads. On pandora I get one 30 second ad every three or so songs whereas Spotify I get like four ads every two songs, not going to lie kinda scummy.",0
You can have 5 stars when Zuckerberg's meta ads are gone. You can find me on Pandora till then.,0
"I'm very new to internet music, but Spotify made it very easy to get a Playlist and use it on my new car. Also, over 70 so it had to be simple!!!",0
"Disappointed with the bugs. I've been a premium user for almost 9 years now. Everything was great until this last update, now the music randomly stops or it won't stop even after closing out the app. I can't control the music from my lock screen anymore if I want to skip a song I have to go to the app. When the bugs are fixed I'll change my review, please fix it I love Spotify .",0
I love my Spotify.....the only only thing that really truly bothers me is when I want to repeat a song it doesn't....it goes on to the next song. I at several times was gonna delete the app...and download another music app....but just decided not to. I'd give this a 5 star rate if it would to repeats on songs but 4 is still ok to good.,1
"new update sucks. removed the ability to pause music and see what is being played seemingly randomly, new ui isn't as good as it used to be.",0
"Very glitchy, audio randomly drops out or stops playing. Control bar disappears from the bottom of the screen and unable to pause, stop or skip audio without closing out of the app.",0
9.99 wasn't a bad deal.... Until they started charging my card twice a month.,1
"Since the recent update, Podcasts play but there is no way to pause, rewind, fast forward etc anymore. sometimes if I close the app and reopen it rights itself, other times it doesn't.",0
This is best app because all songs are available on it and also my favourite Kaira l love *Spotify* Thank you *Spotify*for this you are amazing,1
Enjoyable and excellent performance,1
Great place to listening music,1
Download Spotify mod apks instead of real apk...we are here to listen music not ads,0
"Unethical business practices for artists, and the whole concept of not being able to play specific songs on the app when listening to ad-supported music when you can easily do so on the desktop is more money-grubbing BS we've come to expect from spotify",0
"Just switched from YouTube music to Spotify, I have no regrets. This app is so incredibly better in comparison.",0
"I've been a user for a long time and I must say, Spotify is the best music app by a long shot. Until about a couple of months ago, when I discovered that I wasn't going to be able to renew my Individual subscription. That was just the beginning of it. Now the app crashes incessantly and I sometimes have to 'force stop' from the app information screen on my device. Finally, now the app doesn't even accept any bank cards anymore. Even the ones that have been used on the app are now declined.",0
Great music app I have ever seen,1
"So many shows have been removed from the playlist,so disappointing",0
"It keeps playing some random song whenever you try to listen to anything, and you can't turn it off. If this was fixed i would give 5 stars.This app will waste your time. Edit: Eventually i got so mad at the app that i uninstalled it.",0
"i used to love this app, but now u have to pay to listen a single music and if u litterly listen it for free they give u a shuffle which i dont like.pls bring it back to normal, spotify",0
"TERRIBLE POLICY OF CHANGING COUNTRY! I have been using Spotify for a while on my iPad, now I changed country and Spotify asked me to change profile to my new location. After that, it's been impossible to use Spotify anymore. I cannot even log in on any account. Spotify support was useless. I'm really really sad and angry with this situation.",0
Sometimes says I don't have an internet connection even tho I have one. Otherwise everything is perfectly fine and easy to use,1
"Often find myself switching between YT Music & this app depending on WiFi signal, and at times other considerations.",0
"I tried pretty much all the music app, Amazon music, apple music, you tube music, tidal, Deezer, pandaro. Spotify is just the best. The weekly playlist and in general the playlist are super good, everything works, it's smooth and nice, you have lyrics and you have Joe Rogan experience. I recommend the premium, it worth and deserve the 10$ per month.",1
doesn't go past the loading page,0
Hope for the best  all my best wishes and prayers for Spotify hope the problems faced by business sort out soon,1
"This app was good when I first downloaded it,but as time went on. I descoverd a problem I can't exactly listen to music on it,what I'm saying is that I can't listen or even play the music I want any time I do I don't even know how, it might be bc of my phone but it wasn't like that at first so if you can fix that it would be great.",0
I'm okay with ads and this app was fine until a few days ago. It updated made some changes and it's a bunch of playlist where I'm not even going to get my specific songs that I wanted to listen and this point I feel like YouTube music is better than at least I don't to shuffle the playlist all day long. What kind changes are you doing? I just want a specific song. Not the whole playlist where I have to go find it for 2-3 days it took me to find a week just to findasongnamelalala(I hadtoshort it),0
An out of this World experience,1
fast and easy with many options. I use it for podcasts and its never ending material,0
I wish the ringtones I put on there would STAY & I don't have to keep reloading them. Please STOP adding songs to MY playlist!,0
"I can't play songs in any order like pc or other platforms plus I didn't know about this. So Annoying that I can't play one simple song, the worst part is that it only plays the song you want in premium unlike other platforms. I just Decide to go find a different music player than this",0
"So far it's been an extremely well experience, great music, large selections,LOVE IT",1
Best app ever seen with best music But the problem is we can not download the songs I hope new update comes so that we can download the songs and listen offline but I rate it at 5,0
The best music app ever,1
I think the latest update wasn't a success in my case. Prior to the update I was able the open the Spotify app. on my cell phone and select if I wanted to play music on my cell phone or my Echo. Now if my Echo is blue toothed spotify I have to disconnect the Echo to have music on my phone.,0
i cant listen to the music i search instead it shuffle and im having hard time to listen to it hope it changed.,0
"This app is so desperate for money ,i get ads after every 2 songs i play .",0
Loved building a Playlist together for our romantic vacation.,1
It is mind changing,1
Songs are not playing. I am continuously trying to play songs but Spotify gets exit!!,0
"Blocking a song in 1 list, now actually blocks it everywhere. Its terrible, fix it please.",0
Unable to connect when try ti subcribe to premium.,0
This is a good app but in the last 6 months i have had to update close to 30 times and is making me reconsider other options... 6 days between updates is getting old... (edit) yet another update,0
"Such an amazing app, even though we pay, and have no adds, but easy to use, great music quality, and Is's the best app ever",1
"Needs to be more stable and empowering for user. Excellent and ever improving library. Absolutely terrible client software. This app pauses crashes and buffers more than it should even on locally stored files (Android). Spotify searching and exploration is great when you follow the suggestions less so when you have an idea. The discovery feature is great but it's not enough to account for the bad playback ,gui and organization. I was hesitant to use paid music streaming and now I know why.",0
Loving my experience so far...I always had Google play until they sold to You Tube music which I never liked......SO I finally switched over and I'm very happy so far!! Far more user friendly experience! Wish I hadn't waited so long. ðŸ˜•,1
"The app is only amazing if you upgrade to premium or you're on desktop or a pc application. I stopped subscribing to premium last week and it was not a good idea, ads are always popping every 2 songs and there is a limited skip which I understand but still, So I just decided to upgrade to premium again.",0
"Love that app so convenient, hear the best sounds by pressing with the tips of your fingers!!",1
i hate the adds and i don't want to pay for premium.,0
I love spotify!! There are so many music to listen to and you could even make your own playlist! I also love the features!,1
Music is clear & quality.,1
"Hey folks, there is some major issue with running this app on mobile Data. Please fix it. I have paid for this app, but still can't use it anytime I step out of my house Edit: it's fixed",0
"For the past 4 days, uts keeps showing no internet connection. Apparently i am not the only one having this issue. Spotify fix this issue or tell us the reason why",0
I can select whole CDs or Albums to play straight through or even random shuffle but still stay in that album. Very useful! Plus the search feature works great!,1
Awful for Podcasts. Re-plays already played episodes and the organization is weak. I wouldn't even use Spotify but I listen to a lot of Parcast pods and they went Spotify exclusive. Poor choice on their end.,0
"Listen to songs, play podcasts, create playlists, and discover music you'll love With Spotify, you can listen to music and play millions of songs and podcasts for free. Stream music and podcasts you love and find music - or your next favorite song - from all over the world.",1
Recently the app quality has plummeted. Been using spotify for a year. But after the recent updates (spotify and android) the app started crashing. It has become a pain in the @$$ to use this app. I am thinking of switching to youtube music. It used to be my favorite app. But now it irritates me a lot. It keeps crashing mid play; keeps pausing; the play/next/ prev buttons disappear and such. I hate it.,0
"my ultimate fav music service. good looking app with ample music selection, even songs you had no idea were your fav. Recently it has been doing this weird thing where you cannot see what is playing So I cannot pause it or go forward from the player in the app. I need to delete the app and reinstall it. This is the third time I've had to do that. Please fix it.",0
Spotify is better than joox fosho,1
"Some buds do exist apart from those its the best app for music, There's always scope for improvement",1
"Great music, fast and tons of songs....",1
Spotify is my one stop destination for Music and Podcast because they have the best of everything. I was even able to find my favorite Isaac Desoto's Podcast episodes. Thanks Spotify!,1
"Great collection of songs, remove the we added song feature as well as the recommended songs after the Playlist is over",0
Toooo many ads,0
Very nice app for sound,1
Can't think of a better music app but only thing is I've been having trouble with bugs for a few days now.. so requesting u to fix those bugs and the rest is fine Ps- I'll change my review once the bugs r fixed,0
i really love spotify.. nothing more to saym. its just perfect.. ðŸ˜Šâ£ðŸ’•,1
Mini player is missing and notification does not work making the app useless unless force restarted every few minutes,0
I love it is so helpful to pay attention,1
Love it,1
It's a good app and has all of music I would want but when I first downloaded it I had to immediately update because the app wouldn't even open.,0
yery good,1
"So Glitchy! Spotify doesn't work properly anymore. It keeps closing in the midst of playing. It doesn't show always what is playing and therefore doesn't allow for pausing. Finding back whatever you were listening to when the app closed is next to impossible. The developers must see an enormous increase in crashes. If this is not solved within the next month, I will cancel my subscription. This experience is not worth paying for.",0
I really like your guys app it is amazing can you guys keep the app going forever,1
"To everyone who made this app a reality, I'm sending you love and lots of light! I so love this app, I can't believe I never used it until recently. I'm still trying to navigate through how to download and other things, however, so far, it's been a good experience. Thank you.",1
"I really love using Spotify, but for the past few days the app isn't opening at all. Until this isn't rectified, my review will be one star. Otherwise the app is great to use. Really sad about not being able to listen to my playlists.",0
The new update sucks. You can't play any song you want. It was better before until the developers put play any song in premium & now you can only play music using shuffle mode. Please put the play any song back in free rather than on premium. T _ T,0
"Fantastic app, finally a music app that is worth your money!",1
"love (mostly) everything, except, what was the point of removing the ability to listen to a preview of songs before adding them to a playlist. please add this feature back- I've seen a lot of people complaining about this change.",0
Not sure is it was the Spotify update or Samsung Note 10 Plus update but now it doesn't show the play bar at the bottom of the screen anymore which is frustrating when I want to pause the music or return it to a certain point...it was working great prior to the update.,0
Really enjoy the variety of podcasts and music available to listen to.,1
Good,1
"Rather than convince you to buy Spotify Premium through quality product, they annoy you into it. Thirty seconds of a child babbling incoherently, switching between left only and right only ads, and so on. It's not quirky. It's annoying and is a bottom of the barrel sales technique be which will lose more than make salea.",0
Keeps on crashing after finishing to dload my playlists and transfer the storage to my sd card,0
"excellent sound, very good service",1
I love this app I listen to all my music on it but it's so annoying when the app keeps putting songs on my playlist,0
"Every now and then, the media player won't launch. Which means you can can't fast-forward, rewind or skip thru playlists of podcasts. And occasionally the crashes.",0
It would be a 5 if I was able to listen to whatever song I want with out the thing,0
Find difficult but got it good experience.,1
My Spotify keeps cutting out and stopping since the update!,0
no option skip or go back a song. No control options from my phones (galaxy s22) notification page. Can't see what I'm song im playing. Never had any of these problems on any other device.,0
Very good always had the songs I'm looking for,1
Great music app. The addition of lyrics and videos is also a great update.,1
ok,1
Just awesome they have every song that I wanna listen too,1
"Premium subscriber for many years, and I'm troubled by the increasing instability and new bugs. What worked perfectly for years now fails constantly even on completely different devices. For example, player control will disappear leaving you unable to control playback, then requiring you to force stop app, restart to restore control. And suggested music is far inferior to Pandora's genome. Seems that Spotify favors music that favors their own preferences than yours.",0
"Fairly good service, I just wish there was less ads. I do not mind listening to them, but 4 ads after each song is excessive for me.",0
Love it! All my moods have their own playlist. Awesome way to hear all your favorite tunes!,1
Amazing Music Up. And it gives us the streamers the opportunity to listen to great sound.,1
This is a very good app for listening song when i want to listen songs i open spotify and connect phone with speaker and listen song my experience is very good to listen songs,1
Not working properly,0
"Finally Spotify has matured into a decent app worth paying for. A few issues remain: (1) no indicator on playlist screen to show if sequential play or shuffle play is active. Imho there should be two separate buttons, ie a standard play button and a shuffle button with suitable colour change when active. (2) should have an ""AI"" button to play more songs like this based on past listening history. (3) Need ""hey Spotify"" voice commands, especially when driving. Keep up the innovation ðŸ‘",1
Good at music  ,1
Using spotify for several years and never going back to pandora or youtube,0
Love have splotify premium not to expensive love how I can go offline and download music. Using the car mode is easy makes everything bigger all in all would recommend trying premium,1
"Why is it when we choose a song this other random song plays!? I hate the ""update"" pls change it",0
Great music but after a while the music started cutting out and it had been cutting out every few seconds and if I didn't turn my screen back on it would keep cutting out so I uninstalled and reinstalled it and now nothing loads. I have been using spotify for about 4-5 years now and nothing has happened but now it won't load at all.,0
The player controls sometimes disappear for no reason. App restart forgets what I was playing but fixes the issue.,0
"I am so angry at Spotify! On mobile, whenever I'm trying to listen to a song, it plays something else and it makes the one song I wanted to listen to a playlist with a bunch of other songs! I am so pissed and I am uninstalling the app now ðŸ¤¬",0
"Great app, has all the good songs, every song you could imagine.",1
Good,1
"Good app runs smooth, thanks for your service Spotify.",1
"this is really irritating. how many phone cleaner app should i need to install? coz downloading one app is not enough, it keeps on popping different different app. Once you download suggested cleaner app and when u start using the downloaded app it again suggest you to download another app ,and again this app will suggest you to download another app n it keeps on going..the main problem is if you dont download the suggested app, the app you downloaded before wont funtion, this is super annoying.",0
Such a great app...Many podcast and great music.,1
Playing five ads in a row every few songs just ain't it,0
This apps been really good although there's been an ongoing issue where whenever I go onto a playlist none of the songs show up meaning I cannot remove any songs and can only shuffle through them i would continue using this app if the bug is fixed (also I don't use premium and I'm on android),0
"New update made me change my review. Now I can't see what music is playing inside the app and have zero control over it unless I pick a new song. Then I still can't skip or do anything, not even in the notification bar. Lg v60 thinq",0
Literally my most used app. It's incredibly good for music lovers and playlist enthusiasts! Playlist creation is incredibly easy and intuitive. Sharing music is easy and the library of music is nearly endless. 11/10.,1
Gameing Also Gameing This is ironic but the Joe rogan experience is the game winner like for Joe rogan,1
"Alot of great songs, but I can never play mines. Instead Spotify recommends random songs that I do not want to listen to. I just want to listent to Follow You by Imagine Dragons in peace without other songs! I just started using the app so maybe there is a feature that allows you not to have to experience this inconvenience?",1
Cant stop a song. Cant close it. Cant see what is playing. Fix it or i am gone.,0
My go to. Constany updating which will eat your data like nothing else but its worth it.,1
"Crashing, unreliable, forgets what is in your que. Keeps playing after disconnection with Bluetooth, often playing and unable to skip or stop without completely closing the app, needs some bugs fixed asap",0
Acha sound hai,1
"Love listening to music some of the songs that I want to listen to aren't on there, but I still love the app",1
Way too many adds says 30 mins add free than adds every 5 mins plays same 20 songs on repeat when playlist has plenty to choose from may aswel listen to main stream radio waste of time unless your going to pay for primium but considering it lies to you on free mode dont trust it,0
Too many ads and I can't skip a lot of songs,0
Great but more adds,1
Great content and songs,1
"Between the vast array of music and podcasts available, various charts, specified playlists and the ease of usability, I cant recommend Spotify enough!ðŸ‘ðŸ»",1
"It's so cool app, i always listen to music here!",1
"This app is nice with how they recommend songs, but unless you have premium you can't skip any of the songs which is very stupid. It doesn't allow you to listen to a specific song and when you pick a Playlist it will play songs that aren't even in it. Sometimes the songs it plays for you aren't even in the same language. Hearing lots of good things about this app I was disappointed",0
Easy to use and love having the lyrics and available,1
Good app good music saves data hey what more can one ask for,1
I would like to cancel my subscription BUT I can't so why are you scamming meee. Fix this. Please.,0
Best music software yet,1
Very easy to use although their are some small bugs somthimes.,0
It is a really good app but the ads are really annoying. Ik the solution is to buy premium but there are way too many ads,0
"It is a very good app for listening songs but I just wanted to say that being an army and a kpop lover there are some songs that are not in spotify like still with you by jungkook, promise by jimin, and some more:( Please add these songs then it will be the best app for listening songs. Well I love this app.",1
"New update full of bugs as other reviewers have noted, now for several days. Playback stops, current song and bar to skip or like.",0
99  good app,1
"They keep adding songs go my playlist if there are less than 15 songs. And I only get 6 skips an hour . The commercials are offensive to me and there is no way to block them without getting premium, YouTube at least let's you skip them if they over 15 seconds. The one plus is that I can play it with my phone closed so it doesn't drain my battery. Also it automatically shuffles your songs so you can't randomly pick one to listen to hence why you might prefer a shorter playlist.",0
I dont have premium which i dont mind the ads arent usually that intrusive however I have started receiving ads about promoting talks about religious/god nonsense.,0
Love the app but would have been better if Spotify free had a little more accessibility on mobile.,0
Wonderful there are literally all the songs in the world,1
"Spotify is really the best music app that I ever had , congratulations the app is awesome, literally CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT it",1
Loved the premium version  And its very decent,1
"on it's app just so people can talk about things that are going on at the moment. But they are doing the right thing by keeping Jo Rogan. I'm 30 years old and I have know idea who these people are that are leaving the app, and I don't think many people do around my age +5 years. I've been hearing stuff from people younger than me on the news and shows broadcast saying who are these people and what do they even do. Good bye people that left no one but CD so good luck making money ðŸ˜‚",1
"No ""clear queue ""?!!!! Partially fixed, still dealing with consequences of WORST UPDATE ON ANY APP EVER! EVERYTHING IS NOT WORKING. The only good thing about spotify is FREE SPEECH stand. Radio algorithm just keeps giving you songs you already have in your playlists",0
"I like how Spotify does not interrupt my music just to play an AD(Comnercial), just si I can listen for free! Love the UNNTERRUPTED for 39 min.........un like others!!!! Go SPOTIFY!!ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜",1
"Every time I open the app and try to play music, it plays but it doesn't show the actual icon of the song playing. I have to shut the app down every time I use it and it's very annoying.",0
Awesome,1
I like that they Taylor the music I listen to and make suggestions,1
You guys keep on deducting money but still I don't enjoy music without skips. This purely wrong . It can't keep on going like this.,0
Damn this is absolutely a great app me and my frndz mostly interact in this platform especially the blend one great ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
"it takes too long to load when my wifi works just fine, i dont have any problems with the rest of how the app works",0
"I like Spotify. I got the duo and my husband doesn't use it. Tried to go back to single premium and it hasn't happened. Other than that issue, I enjoy the large variety of music.",1
The songs are amazing,1
Love it but it needs a way that you can just skip any song with out having to wait after a sertent point need to be able too do it all the time with no set backs â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸,0
I like the app works very when I want to listen to music during class,1
"Extremely disappointed Spotify would bow to the mob and decide to censor ANYONE (deleting podcasts is censorship). Spotify does not support the 1st amendment as they have shown. They are persuaded by a tyrannical administration that denounces the constitution. I will be canceling my membership. Get woke, go broke...",0
"Any ""Music App"" that puts a priority on lies from a talking head instead of the musicians and their music isn't much of a music app worth having.",0
15 ADS IN A ROW!! If I have to sit through that much I should be able to listen to my playlists.,0
Please correct the recent update that makes Spotify stop playing music in the middle of a song. You must exit out of the app and go back into it in order to play anything and it's starting to get old.,0
Ive come back to Spotify after a few years with YouTube Music Amazon Music and Deezer After many frustrations Im impressed again with Spotify,1
New bug found where the UI for controlling the music which is playing doesn't appear making it impossible to change tracks or pause/play music.,0
"It's a nice experience so far, and I like some of playlist they made for me",1
It's fantastic!!!!!!! Omgg ik this isn't BECAUSE of this app but music is one of my therapy. This is also the reason why I took out one star. Music is one of my therapy and ads are constantly ruining the therapy mood. But this app is fire and the lite version is more.,0
Music is a vehicle for expressing many moods/modes!!,1
Very Nice ,1
Very good play songs,1
Every now and then the play button does not appear so I can not stop the song and I end up having to uninstall the app. So annoying considering I'm a premium customer. I wonder if this happening to others? Please get it sorted.,0
"For 2 years now, I've been told that if I listen to ads, I'll get 30-minutes of ad free music even though another set of 2 minutes worth of ads will play 5min later. It's infuriating and Spotify seems to have no plans to fix it.",0
I don't know why they don't let me play the song I want but they do it randomly and when I want the hear Ariana Grande's song 34+35 it choose another song so Spotify pls fix this,0
"Was missing this in our country ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡°, but the ads and the other bugs are so much annoying, this was awesome few years back it was free and there was so much to choose but now, it's a time waist",0
"I have been paying for spotify for years and can't live without it, but recently: There's a bug the past week or so where the play bar doesnt appear and the songs will stop playing at random intervals. Please look into thisðŸ™ƒ",0
"The best of its kind. Smooth UI, superd music algorithm. I tried the other ones but none came close overall.",0
"They say you can play local files through the app, and while that's technically true, local files are all just dumped in a single giant playlist with no layered organization. This makes local file playing all but useless. I live in Alaska and often drive places where I don't have reliable phone connection, so an app that doesn't have a usable local file option is not workable to me.",0
"I would have rated it 5 but the lyrics in songs are in tht(ex.korean,telugu) language only i mean english too and I took subcription of a week and it just wont let me see the download optionðŸ˜“",1
"With few exceptions, a great site.",1
"I love Spotify, I mostly use it on my Chromebook because on computer it's sorta like premium except the audio quality isn't as good as premium",0
"Great for music and podcasts, Still having issues with crashing and podcasts stop playing, this is usually after an update is conducted, using the android version on my phone. It is not that big a deal tho",0
Check your phone no problem,1
"I'd love to give more stars, but recently the app has had a lot of issues. The biggest problem is when I minimize or have to close the app and then go back to resume listening, it won't bring up the song or podcast I was listening to. I have to force close it and open the app again to be able to get back to what I was listening to. Sometimes it also randomly moves to the next podcast or song when I haven't even touched it. This is very frustrating as I'm a premium member.",0
It was about to connect the music to the living rooms TV when I didn't even ask or idk how it got there.,0
This app has been bugging out alot. The play bottom on the bottom goes away and now I can't pause the song. I had to Uninstall this app to go away. So far I have done it 3 times. I'm not going to add this app until this issue is resolved.,0
This is the best place to get some music ðŸŽ¶ like my word you can find so many songs from so many artists And the fact for how well it runs on low end device's I highly recommend downloading Spotify to get the best experience possible Five star in my opinion ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ,1
â¤ï¸ Spotify has everything I want in music,1
"Like Spotify, don't like the latest update.. it won't open",0
This is an amazing app it's so easy to use and has all of my favorite songs,1
"I used to LOVE this app nothing but problems now. Customer support are not helpful what so ever, I've reset my password about six times now. Every link they sent just sent me back to my email or a random place in the app, it's only good if you use on a computer or xbox. Other than that I'm sick of the constant problems, I've used this app since 2013 and i HATE to say it. But I'm done with this, going back to iHeartRadio",0
I've got all my favorite songs here...old and newðŸ”¥!,1
I like the app BC I can listen to music and play games at same time,1
Most unreliable software I have used in a decade. With every new feature the app gets worse. Completely unreliable in the car. Awful and unresponsive website as well. I would be ashamed to be a developer at Spotify.,0
Good,1
"Everything works just fine, built a real good app",1
Fantastic and free!,1
Overall a great app to use for music and podcasts,1
"Used to be 5 but now 1 star since recent update. Player stops randomly, doesn't show playing, can't start or stop, no controls need to shut the app constantly. Fixed by delete and redownload but then a few days later back to the same. Utter shite. Please give me the old version back.",0
Better luck next time,1
Very good,1
"so far my experience has been amazing, really love the app loving the ease with which I can find my favourite music and create playlists.",1
"I used to be able to add songs to queue by sliding on the playlist, after the last update I can not do it anymore.",0
I enjooyed the will listen to music.. but i get irriteted while ads come.. Thank you..ðŸ‘ŒðŸ™,1
I enjoy listening to my music on different devices..In the house and car..This app offers both,1
"Everytime I play my liked songs, it starts playing suggested songs that I didn't ask for, and refuses to just work properly",0
Why is there no repeat button???,0
I get like 4 ads in a row before tow songs play and then 4 more ads,0
I love how you can listen to it for free but I hate how it plays random songs,0
"first of all, its like my bff cuz i spend most of the time on spotify it cures me in all the ways but since this morning i've been facing some issues... whenever i'm trying to hit the search option it just closes the application. I really want this to be fixed <3",0
THANKS,1
"This most recent update is nice, letting Android users have similar experiences to Apple users. However I find that the app will close or stop my songs when I'm not in the app and that when I initially open the app my 'now playing' song doesn't show up it just starts the song. So I have to close and open it again.",0
"They try to make you buy premium on phones by implementing the worst features imaginable, like forcefully modifying your Playlist, not allowing you to play the same song twice in a row, and numerous others. I can beat with ads and understand why they are there, but seeing them throw all the features onto phone exclusively is disgusting. If you want to get spotify, get it on iPad or tablet as it has many of the same features as premium on phone, just with ads.",0
It keeps giving me 2 or 3 ads you should do something about that and almost everyone is just broke in buying Spotify premium but everything else is fine,1
Please add a feature where I can shuffle all my playlists! I will give you 5 starsâ¤,1
Its an amazing,1
"Last nite still Ok. This morning, the apps auto close when i start to play. Already restart my phone, re-login and re-install the apps not able to fix the problem.",0
My favorite music app,1
Very fast to find music.,1
It was a nice app they used to put like one ad in the middle of a few songs but they've increased the number of ads to 3-4 between 2 songs like damn the ads r more than the number of songs I listen to it's so annoying ðŸ˜‘,0
This app is not open I install 3 times,0
Given all the different avenues that you can choose from as far as your music provider for me personally I like Spotify because it just keeps up with my interest in my different taste of music. Five stars from me,1
"I really liked spotify at first but then it got updated or something and now it has gotten very annoying I can't enter my playlists to pick songs the only way I can listen to them is shuffle, I also can't remove songs from my playlist so if that could be fixed I'd rate higher.",0
Great music at your fingertips when you need it in this ruff world we live in.,1
The app isnt opening stating that there is a bug preventing it from opening.,0
It is spotify after all,1
"I'd give more stars if we were given some info on what the upgrades are when they're available. A quick description would be really helpful, it's silly that such a large app doesn't do that.",0
Move the pause button back to the middle. Reinventing the wheel for no reason.,0
"Must have app, if you are member then play anything non-stop",0
This is the THIRD time I've reviewed Spotify in three days. I have used it plenty and decided to uninstall it due to their misinformation platform. The fact that my review has been removed three times is appalling. Obviously Google or Spotify is handling this and deciding to hide negative reviews.,0
"The new update does now allow Android auto to retrieve my music. I usually could manually overide by starting the music on my phone vs using the car interface, but the new driving mode doesn't respond when I press play or on a specific song title to get it to play. Please fix.",0
"I LOVE IT!!! What a great App with a vast variety of music. ðŸŽ¶ Something for everyone. When I first downloaded Spotify I spent hours just looking for and listening to my favorite tunes. Needless to say, I was very pleased. I'm so glad my son told me about this app. Spotify also gives me 30 minutes of ad free listening just for watching a short video. It's wonderful. I LOVE â¤ï¸ SPOTIFY!!! Thanks Spotify for this great App. KUDOS ðŸ‘",1
I am a fan of music and Spotify has all I need ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–,1
"Spotify is the best music app in the world.Whom no one can compete with, there is no one equal to it?I ran together for 2 years.I really enjoyed running Spotify.I've never had more fun running spotify than I have",1
when and how does one change the payment to google play credit like announced a month ago.,0
"Been a premium subscriber for many years. Spotify is hands down the best music streaming service, I'll never use anything else.",1
This is a fantastic app and gives me an eclectic range of music whenever I want. Love it!,1
App is now full of bugs and barely useable and have to constantly close it down and try to restart it. Annoying as hell when pay for premium subscription,0
I've always loved Spotify! The $10 a month is worth it to me since I listen to music pretty much all day every day. Being able to download music offline too is also nice especially when driving in areas that don't have good signal. Been using it for years and I definitely recommend it.,1
"I can't live without Spotify,i love it",1
"For tablet in landscape it doesn't look good , album art is small at a corner why can't you show it same as in portrait mode like album art and lyrics below in full screen",0
Its good we can get all songs in all language and it have lyrics also,1
Latest update sucks!You can't see to pause or forward what you're currently listening to it's absolutely rediculous. Whoever thought that would be a good idea has issues.I cancelled my premium sub and I will delete this asinine app!,0
It's a good app to have because they play good music ðŸŽ¶ and different types of songs that people can dance to and sing to ðŸ˜Š love Spotify music ðŸŽ¶ enjoy â˜ºï¸ Spotify music ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ w,1
Absolutely wonderful. Highly recommend for those who are willing to pay monthly. Thanks for the music service,1
"Lots of songs, good internet connection, multiple play options, GOOD songs. FREE!!!",1
4 Star Just Because This App Is Paid. All Other Things in this App Is Just Awesome â£ï¸.. Loved The App.... Spotify ðŸ”¥,1
The app is good. BUT the advertisements which run for more than a minute are irritating. Most of the times i switch to different apps to listen to the song as the adds just won't stop.,0
Please fix it whenever I play the song it doesn't play the song I play fox it please,0
Love it subscriber since DAY ONE,1
"As a DJ and music connoisseur, this app allows me to store, play, and discover not only my favorite tracks but also my future favorite tracks. It is like having the ultimate record collection without the debt or storage space required physically or digitally. Spotify rocks!!!",1
Enjoyable found all my old songs and love listening to my different play lists. So easy to use,1
"Cuberstalers, cgberbullies, narcissistic hackers BFF. The whole guns don't kill people people kill people Vail to hide behind. It's a good thing your not spinach then you can be recalled.",1
Was working great until I installed the latest update and now the app acts like I have zero internet. The rest of my apps have web access so something is happening. I'm month in so far as a first time premium customer.. not a good look.,0
"This app constantly stops playing music and podcasts randomly. Spotify, I don't need driving directions, I just need you to play music.",0
Very clear and best choice,1
Horrible it won't stop playing music even after restarting my phone.,0
The only place I get my music from! Spotify!!,0
"Dropped youtube music app for Spotify I haven't been disappointed,$9.99 per month that I pay is a great price to get to listen to what you want with zero adds bombarding you..bravo Spotify on a great fantastic app highly recommended..",1
"Im done with this app, 6 years of paid subscription and the latest updates have made it un-useable. The shuffle algorithm is poor at best, bugs like wrong album artwork displayed, turning on shuffle at random times when i dont want it on. I cant even put my main list on to just play through my saved songs anymore, it gets through about 10 and then started shuffling random music That isnt im my list nor anything i want to listen to. Be nice to get some help from someone at spotify, never happens.",0
"This App Is Just Amazing! No words but it would be nice if there were romanized lyrics in some songs for example Korean, latin etc. Overall, AWESOME!",1
Spotify is the world's best music app it it very fun to use when you. Are board or just wanna listen to music or podcast or even make something.,1
OK,1
It's an amazing app so much so that I use it every day it even makes personalized playlists for you based on the types of music you like,1
I love Spotify!!!,1
"Besides the absurd amount of ads this app has there's also Joe Rogan spreading antivaxx, anti-intellectual misinformation and propaganda. YouTube doesn't have as many ads and they're all skippable.",0
Very helpful kind and quick to respond if there are issues with the app,1
"I Really Like What I Can Do, Like What I Mean Is I Can Make Playlist's & Not 1 Add Has Appeared. I Really Like This Thank you",1
I absolutely love spotify its the best app everIve been using it for a long time now and Ive never had any issues so yeah great app,1
half the time the track playing doesn't show so I have to close and reopen app,0
I like it cause it has some of the songs I like however the fact that they only come in Playlists so I can't just listen to my song I picked kinda pisses me off,0
Bru it's good and all but they made it so when u collab to make a playlist it just doesnt work whatsoever atleast it doesnt for me and multiple other people I know ðŸ˜¡,0
Tired of seeing COVID-19 tags nonstop simply because a podcast talks about it.,0
Difficulty in opening acct and profile tabs in app.,0
"Superb didnt know such a app existed. wish the player would delete my recently played though, great standalone app!",0
I love this app it lets me stream and listen to music,1
I really like a sound.....hello everyone...have a nice day....ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž Stay safe...always god bless...ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™,1
Love the variety and radio theater.,1
Very very nice app ,1
The music for you is actually good and picks put similar artists to what you listen to.,1
It is a nice app but the advertising came after little gap we all have television for advertising and shows we have to listen songs not thatðŸ˜,0
"Enhance widget options so i can do more than fast forward, pause and reverse from the lock screen. i should have the option to have a time bar that lets me go back to specific parts of the song from my home page or lock screen.",0
Great App. Love the content and easy of use,1
Will never play when I select a song from Playlist or allow me to choose my watch as the device to play the music. It spins and returns to menu. Total let down.,0
This app is SO buggy lately. There's no control bar to pause music when its playing and now it just randomly shuts down.,0
"App is now unusable since last update 4/8/22. Music cuts out and sometimes you lose the pop-up that allows you to skip,rewind, or pause/play. Must restart to fix only to have it happen a few songs later.",0
Making it different from other's is Podcast.... Love the app,1
There is no better app for music and/or podcasts.,0
"I really love my Spotify! I always find the songs i want and it does work perfectly wherever I am. They offer the free version and that's what I started with about 4 years ago then after a little while I subscribed and as much as I don't like to spend money, this is one app that I really don't mind paying for. I use it in my cart, at my house and even at friends get together. I Just press play on my different playlists :) thank you guys.",1
"App use to be great but now it bugs out and doesn't show what's song playing or let me pause it, it also just cuts out",0
Best music service I've ever used,1
Good but annoying ads,0
It's got all the song that I like,1
Love music and Spotify has it!,1
Not sure what happened but it now periodically freezes/stops the audio while I am listening to podcasts. Overall its a great platform but this glitch is really annoying.,0
After last these last few updates it's become incredibly glitchy,0
Good quality,1
After the last couple of updates I can't even open the menu without it crashing.,0
It needs to work offline ðŸ˜’,0
I did't get contnue music of any playlist and i have to choose music. So plz solve this,0
The lyrics is delay whenever you listen to the song.,0
Everything is fantastic developers but 1 star less dur to no queue viewing option. Try to add the queue stuff it would be great then. Other than awesomeness.,1
"Gotta love MrBallen's new podcast; just when you deemed it impossible to top his YouTube channel, John lays down four aces...",0
"Amazing selection, from obscure oldies to,New releases.love it",1
Bad lyrics. Poor sound quality.,0
"still doesn't recognise local files, wastes data on streaming when you have the tracks already. edit: current update recognises local files, you still can't read them in place of tracks on playlist.",0
It's good but we need Tamil lyrics for Tamil songs not in English okay !,0
Commercial after every song. Promised 30 minutes add free but 2 songs later you have to listen to 3-4 30 sec ads. Cant preview some songs/albums for whatever reason. But it still a good app. But really annoying sometimes.,0
"Almost everytime using the app, it at some point doesnt show whats playing anymore, forcing to restart the app",0
"Every time a notification comes through since the update, Spotify pauses then never starts playing again. This includes Spotify's in-app ads. Pretty awesome when trying to listen while doing things and it's paused every few minutes.",1
"I love it because you can make playlists,follow your favorite artists. But the only bad thing about this is all the ads.",0
24 hours very happy music in Spotify tq,1
App constantly freezes or the play now section don't show. The music cuts out every do often. Never had so many problems recently it's frustrating to the point I'll look elsewhere for a subscription service,0
Overall a better music app then others ðŸ§‘â€ðŸŽ¤....I have a suggestion -ADD FLOATING LYRICS!!,0
Great will you please fix the normalization volume,1
"Spotify has a extensive music library. Chances are if you want they have it . But there mobile set up is poor for any kind of customizing, it's extremely difficult to build a play list if you have a lot of music to add , and no way to simply remove a song from your Playlist. Makes it very difficult to build your play list if you plan on listening to any music while your offline or out of service areas.",0
It becomes a one of the west app,1
I listen to music on spotify but recently spotify has been shuffling my liked songs. I didn't even press shuffle play.,0
Everytime I play a music. I get kicked out. Fix it?,0
"9 times out of 10 runs great, sometimes music keeps playing when app is closed or music doesn't play at all when app shows it's playing.. Understand copyright issues but shame some good songs/ play lists get deleted Sometimes off-line mode not reliable when out camping or limited signal/ on a plane but hey can't complain really",0
"Good app, just sucks without payment, it just kinda seems stupid how you can't listen to a specific song, and how having your own playlist doesn't matter cause all it will play is recommended songs. But ya, with a payment plan, it's good. Without one, it sucks",0
"I get to listen to all of my favourite songs, from the 60s 70s and 80s,and I don't mind the adds either ðŸ‘Œ",1
"So many lyrics are wrong for my favourite songs and no way to report it on android. Learn to transcribe or control metal lyrcis, or don't put them there. Disgraceful.",0
LIKE,1
This latest update prevents the app from working at all. As soon as I click a playlist it freezes.,0
Amazing app you can listen your favorite music anything anywhere. You can also listen to songs of favorite artists.,1
i play mt playlist. bu instead spotify keep on playing other music which i am not recognize and not even in my playlist list,0
Spotify was my favorite way to stream and listen to music but they continue to publish joe Rogan podcast which has actively led to people's deaths through misinformation and hate.,0
"App works just ok, glitchy sometimes whether I have a good cellular or wifi connection, is there a setting that I'm missing, it automatically starts playing once one of my Bluetooth devices are connected whether I want it to or not. I don't want it to automatically do that.",0
My everyday music app. Has a large database of songs compared to Prime Music.,1
Having bother at moment playing for 10mins then stopping.... wild frustrating.. what is going on.. normally its spot on brilliantðŸ‘... Help.,0
Literally crashes and closes the app every time i leave the app. Starting to regret having downloaded this.,0
This app sucks. Anytime i try to listen to someone elses playlist spotify recommends TOTALLY DIFFERENT MUSIC. I literally have this setting turned off on all devices and it still does this. Why reccomend songs dude remove this feature it is literally useless,0
Works exactly how it should. Never had any issues with it.,0
"My Spotify has been crashing for a few days. And i just can't figure out how to fix it. As soon as I try to play a song, the app just closes by itself. And if i try to share a song on my Instagram stories it just doesn't show the option. I have tried many things like restarting my device, uninstalling then reinstalling the app and even clearing the cache. I don't know what happened. Please resolve this problem immediately:(",0
how come when we use spotify on computer we can loop for free but when we use it on phone we gotta pay. cmon man thats just stupid,0
Y'all need to work on how the music is sorted and sorting options. Also the options if I want recommend music and etc. Don't care for podcasts or whatever tracks you think I may like.,0
"PLEASE stop taking good music off of the app because of ""Copyright Issues"", I pay for premium and unlimited songs and I deserve such",0
"So far, it's been okay but not enough to convince me to go premium. I know a lot of people that you Spotify, but so far, I don't get all the hype. And why does it turn on my microphone when I open the app?",0
Actually I'd give it a 5 star but there's a big problem. 3 months ago when I updated this app and tried to play any song none of the songs were playing. And if I tried to search anything after that it buffers. This again happened yesterday again. IDK what type of problem is this 'cause Spotify still runs smoothly in my pc and my dad and mom's phone and also the lite version works perfectly in my phone. Please Spotify give me solution to fix this issue. My phone is running on android 8.1,0
Removed Pawan Kalyan Tholiprema Album etc,1
There is no better anywhere than Spotify. I've tried them and not got a selection like Spotify and the Coustmer support is the best and fastest.I can send a message and all good within a hour most of the time .I love the set up and everything else. I'm am a real customer and will always be. The Best never rest at Spotify.I seen a couple of people saying that they were no way to tell what was playing but I have always seen it and I know I have the newest update. I have never had it to crash ????,1
"Spotify is fine except when ur a free listener. It gives u limited skips, adds random songs to your Playlist, gives u ad after ad after ad, and it just ruins the whole app. I will no longer be using spotify",0
Worst music app ever. Just doesn't work properly. Too many technical glitches. Shameless company should spend money on improving the technology / fixing issues before spending on advertising. Complete waste of money.,0
I love this app...I able to find all the music that I'm looking from old to new and I love how it keeps up to date with the new hits and artists.....,1
Awesome! So many great podcasts and musicians on here!,1
great app,1
"Love this app, its totally rocking.ðŸ˜ It has million of songs plus all my favourite music. + like to add small suggestion to developpers "" It would be really nice if you guys add statistical section to the app.... Mean - I like to see total playable minutes in my music collection (X) and total playable minutes allocated to each playlist (Y) of mine. Also the the percentage allocated to each playlist/ artist - Y/X â€¢/â€¢ ðŸ™‚ Thanks",1
"Pretty good, I just don't like the ad system but its good with them",1
Creating custom playlists is so smooth,1
"Is very organized, has lots to chose from, both podcasts and songs. Paying for Premium is definitely worth it!",1
Free user plays 2 min ads every 2-3 songs. Sometimes it'll be 30 mins before a ad but u gotta time it right somewho. Won't play the playlist just starts playing random songs. Can't see playlist and pic songs. This app needs work,0
Good app they used to play 2 ads every 2 songs however now after every song they play 4 ads . Amazon prime and youtube is much better than this .I'd recommend people to use amazon prime and YouTube instead of this or you can pay high prices for spotify premium,0
"--Update 2: ok now I really had enough, it's non stop propaganda. When my prime month is over I will uninstall Spotify. --Update: Achtung! Als mein Premium ablief machten sie Werbung fÃ¼r die Impfung gegen Kinder! Deshalb nur 1 Stern.---- Nicht so Benutzerfreundlich und Bugs, warum kann ein millionenschweres Unternehmen keine App ohne Bugs produzieren?",0
"Keeps asking to allow Bluetooth every time I open the app. I don't need Spotify that much, if its going to start getting annoying with all these messages I'll just cancel my sub and uninstall",0
"Great algorithm! Recommendations are really great and sound quality is amazing but lately I've been facing some problems regarding connectivity. It shows ""I'm not connected to Internet"" whereas all other apps work perfectly... idk what to do but... Spotify Lite solves the problem",0
Excellent and convenient,1
Spotify...... please read the many many comments reporting exactly the same issue and FIX IT. i.e. music controls are no longer showing (android),0
I think it has good songs but I would like to see more Friday night funking ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,1
Very good app for music and podcast. But ads are too frequent.,0
"This is literally the worst app that you can choose for listening to the music. It doesn't even let you to choose your music unless you're premium. But its not a only problem , after a few months suddenly the app doesn't let you to log in Such a waste of time !",0
"Phenomenal! Amazing library of music, it's the only streaming platform I use now. I also love how it makes playlists for me, no more searching for song after song, just pick a list and go!",1
During this year we had two problems like can't login or lost premium...,0
This app is so amazing you can choose Song Download now,1
Absolutely ðŸ’¯ the best music app out there Some integration issue but is still excellent Multi device use issue need a tweak in a modern home ðŸ¡ Love to be a tester and am starting to do my own mixes ðŸ’œ,1
It's not working right. All ways saying check your wifi.,0
Whith the new April 13th update you can't play any songs without shuffling the songs so i wouldn't install it right now untill it's fixed,0
"I hate Spotify because everytime I search up a song and I click on it,it just takes me to a playlist that the songs in and makes me shuffle play it and I've checked if it did this to other people's phones it didn't and it's really annoying and I always give it a chance or redownload it but this time I'm just going to download something else because Spotify doesn't seem to want to work",0
"When I play a song, it plays a complete different one that is ""similar"" to it",0
Excellent app for all music needs.,1
Ads after every 2 songs is ridiculous. I know you want people to pay for premium but this makes me want to get pandora again and pay for that.,0
Can't listen to my music it always pause when it plays,1
I love dis app,1
"They seem a little too desperate in pursuading us into a premium. Ad after each and every song. Too annoying , although they have a vast collection of songs",0
"A FEW years ago I used spotify. I found now there is not the Same faultless of programing though, there now is problems with Playing a complete song and finishing that same song. The program doesn't play a whole song.",0
Indeed No.1 music app in india no doubt with so many active users and so many cool features so yeah i personally would like to give them like 100 of stars but that no tpossible so yeah nice work Spotify staff team for maintaing the app so nicely ðŸ˜„,1
Worst app it always show no internet connection,0
"Problem logging back in when offline. For whatever reason, Spotify logged me out of the app. But I had been using it offline. So, when I tried to log back in, the Spotify app kept saying ""you're offline"", which I wasn't. The only way round it was to delete the app and reinstall. There has to be a better solution!",0
"Cant choose what song to play, if i create a playlist it adds songs for me, and overall i have no control over my music now, at this point im considering soundcloud or Pandora........",0
Wonderful song and genre grouping along with great deals from start to finish! No unexpected ads when you pay the small price for something DEFINITELY worth it!,1
Spotify is ghetto fabulous it has all the jams I need to get by in life thanks Spotify,1
Used to be the only choice but not anymore. I prefer my music service not pushing podcasts to me. Higher quality music can be found elsewhere too.,0
"First of all, it is so glitchy. I feel like there's a new problem every other day. Secondly, it feels like spotify is forcing users to pay for premium (which I heard is mediocre at best) by playing 3-4 ads every 2-3 songs while also constantly giving pop-up ads. It's nearly impossible to listen without getting aggravated. Spotify keeps playing a playlist when I'm only trying to add the song and the shuffle algorithm is atrocious, amongst other things.",0
"It's always been a great streaming service. I've let my subscription cancel for years and come back to my same massive library, fully intact.",1
"Love this app, I've been using it for years but as of recently there's been a bug going on where whenever I open the app it doesn't let me change tracks it just is at idle for whatever reason then I close the app and open it again and it lets me use it. Sometimes when I open it it's stuck at the Spotify loading logo and I have no idea why. Please patch because then I'll change my review to a five star",0
"One of the better music apps out there if you can pay for premium, but didn't give me the lyrics feature at all.",0
Love the music just wish you could replay songs after song has finished,1
All good just wished it would let me go back to the beginning of.a song,0
"What the hell? I purchased Spotify Mini now a single song doesn't play in my android. Not even a playlist. I reinstalled it, checked my internet. No way it's solved. Please consider this. What's the point of buying premium if it doesn't work?",0
Love how every artist I listen to is on it,1
I mean the app is not bad but the annoying thing is it keeps automaticly turning off everytime I play or open an app so yea ðŸ‘Ž,0
Best app to watch ads ðŸ™‚,1
"Does what it says on the tin. Would be 5 stars if the android app came with the ""swipe to queue"" gesture",0
Randomly starts playing ads (not even music) when I'm sleeping. Deleting this annoying app. And youtube music is much better!,0
Best music app I have seen,1
AWFULL APP DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS APP YOU WILL REGRET. LITERALLY SPEAKING .I WANNA GIVE THIS APP -1000Ã—INFINITE RATE .,0
It's really irritating me.. There is no option for correct song Play on. Absolutely a damaze app..ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜  Motherchod App is too more improvement needed..,0
Very pleasant it picks songs that I like makes listening to music heads free easy,1
"PLEASE trim the fat on your inefficient app. I have just about a top of the line Android and the lag is nasty. Terrible UX. Slow to cast, which I love to do and constantly do.",0
"More ads than music if you aren't paying. Still true with 4+ ads for a song or two. Don't use this app if you like listening to music in the shower, YouTube has shorter ads.",0
I keep getting the same songs over and over when I hit shuffle. What's the point of having a shuffle feature if it doesn't work?,0
"I like Spotify but I'm very disappointed with the app and Bluetooth connectivity. 99% of times it doesn't start playing music when I connect to my in-car bluetooth radio. Very rarely it does start automatically. It's very annoying and I only use the app in my car. All battery savers for the app turned off, still not working.",0
Some compatibility issues with bluetooth/car connection and spotify,0
"It works perfectly except for 1 thing. I have a premium plan but whenever i go to my plaulist and press shuffle, it says ""youve discovered a premium feature"". Thats all fun and games but when i select another playlist it works fine.",1
"guts, click the permissions tree before downloading this app, it collects your personal phone number, emails, pictures voice data, gestures used, AND stores it on a probably hackable server using its quote unquote secure transmissions but they wont elaborate on how its transferred or anything. DO NOT DO IT guys, we are all on YT music (Youtube music, red and white pic) or soundcloud lately. More news to come later, i think a boycott is in-order gentlemen....!@!",0
"I'm not gonna lie, I loved this app when it first came out. But my lord are the glitches getting annoying, update servers or something. It's Terrible.",0
Excellent song choice artist song writers,1
This app is more concentrating on ADs rather playing a music...even if you here saying listen music without 30 min interruption still after 5 min you will listen a shirt AD... Why should I purchase your app..only to stop ads..common...only stupid people will buy your app to stop ads...rather I will download songs and hear them,0
I love the fact that I can listen to whatever kind of music I like!,1
I hate this If i have spotify free i can only listen to the half of the song on mobile hate this f#$Ã— u,0
More bugs. I can't share music or playlists no matter the medium.,0
"Spotify is a phenomenal app if you paid for premium. If you dont you will suffer countless annoying ads, 6 skips per hour on phone which sounds stupid and you cant select a specific song on your phone. You have to shufle through the album to listen to it. Why do i have to pay to get rid of this suffering?",0
Audio quality is lower compared to deezer,0
"Absolute shite controls always lock adds constantly run. Constant interruptions i never use it Plus you ruined the joe rogan podcast for me. Lies about watching video to allow for 30 minutes uninterrupted listening watch this add, then plays more adds after is play fist add. More adds then music selection Plus they ruined JRE",0
"This is the best app for music. But i have one problem, please don't embarrass with those adds regarding Spotify premium as not all of us are able to take the premium version. And i am not saying that stop those adds but just limit it like the adds should come after 9-10 songs. Thank you",0
"Terrible. It crashes all the time. I turn it back on, doesn't know what it plays last, have to close it or completely log out and back in. Can't make a decision on wrifi or . Over it.",0
I agree i have free version....but c'mon 3 ad in row is so unfair that too in between important time when you are about to lift.... Spotify for hd song to have gone mood killer,0
"If you want to listen hindi songs in daily mix list, it's not possible as you mix other languages song which is very annoying",0
The service is worth the money Music from anyone and anywhere at your fingertips is phenomenal and leads to a broadening of your tastes,1
My Downloads disappear after I re-open the app and downloads again,0
"i rly like this app, i love spotify. it expands my music taste and I just love that. my only (very small) problem is that I think they removed the feature to preview songs when you're like adding them and when it's recommended. yea that's all, overall, nice app !",1
"Premium user for 5+ years, and the quality is going downhill. I don't ask much of this service, I really just shuffle my ""liked songs"" playlist. That's it. My complaints are: the album covers are never accurate in the drop down menu (not even lag, they're random it seems), the Watch app recently updated and now you cannot use your watch to change the song on your phone, and of course the shuffle SUCKS. Give me an option to shuffle, and not repeat a song until the WHOLE playlist plays first.",0
"Really... Just check it out, versatile, I'm seasoned.. I like the daily mixes. And enhanced Playlist feature . 70's soul pulls in the deep cuts. Well done!",1
Great but wish they would mix it up more.,0
Spotify has been not bad at the beginning but nowadays it doesn't let u get rid of a song from your screen once u play anything on the app & also we did have an outage of recent & since that problem that's how it's been. Hope these bugs get solved soon.,0
"Good music, non-stop playlists, no ads (for premium) hence gives you the best feeling when low. Truly music is medicine.",1
"I've been using this app for a couple of years, but lately the app crashes (songs stop playing after several seconds, I can never listen to a full song). Please fix this issue..",0
Really easy to use and an amazing range of music. Would recommend.,1
GOOODD,1
"I've tried to make a group session for nearly 2 weeks and it doesn't work, please fix it, it's terrible.",0
Can download songs for offline playing,0
This app sucks because it adds song I don't want to my playlist and I can't find a way around it. If I want a certain song from my playlist and I click on it it just plays a little bit of it. I also can't go back if I want to listen to a song again. idk if I have to get premium or something for this type of stuff. The only thing I like about it is that it plays when my phone is off or when I'm on some other app But I would rather just use YouTube and leave my phone on and let the music play :\,0
"Been using this app for years even use it while playing my PS4, but lately this app hasn't been working like it used to. Automatically skips to the next track without even asking/hitting next track, on it's OWN. And then a lot of music I had saved on my playlist starts to disappear without me editing the playlist, there one day gone the next. It's really weird that this app does that A LOT. Used to rate this 5* their lucky I'm rating this 3*.",0
Music good podcast good me listen,1
"Good for a while then it started to pause randomly and not unpaise, disconnect my Bluetooth, wouldn't open.. yeah and the barade of ads.",0
One of the best playlist ever made,1
"I mean, some of the songs I wanna listen to are free on here that aren't on Spotify. I don't get why I can't have a single song on a playlist without having to shuffle through a bunch of others that were recommended to me. I can't even choose which one I gotta listen to. It's just shuffle until it plays. Honestly a horrible design in general.",0
Really nice music app I use to collect cds alot but then my dad told me Spotify is good so I did and now just download music,1
Favorite music app,1
No problem,1
Great music collections!,1
"Wonderful app,Wonderful features, Wonderful collection of songs",1
"Getting revenged by more ads for non paying and ""upgrade"" to premium.",0
I love this app because it has lyrics ðŸ‘,1
Podcasts randomly change to the next episode and I lose my place. Also constant ads and popups to Buy premium. OFFER ENDING SOON yeah I know it's been ending for like 3 years.,0
awesome!! Spotify has never let me down!! I can find the songs other apps don't have with lyrics and more from the artists!! Love it!,1
"My ratings for this app keep going down. Same bug that has been plaguing the pay options resurfaced after a ""fix"". When I asked for a refund for my subscription they said no because it has been 14 days. But the app didn't work for the past 14 days. Find another service if you have an android phone .",0
Great app to find new music ðŸ‘Œ,1
"Accidentally deleted my old review. I have been a Premium user since day one. Last year (21) Spotify had some serious issues, but it's back on track. Spotify remains the best music streaming platform.",1
Horrible. Can't go back in a song or Listen to a specific song without premium. unless you have the funds for a premium account it's absolutely not worth it,0
Spotify used to be so good but it barley works anymore. I don't want to have to pay to get basic features that used to be available to free users.,1
Its very nice to listen songs,1
Easy access to music but every time I answer the phone after using the app the music comes on during the phone call. Since new update the playback bar at the bottom of the screen isn't coming up. App is now unusable .,0
After years I'm still having the same problem of my downloading music switching storage. It has now happened over 10 times in just over 2 weeks I'm done with this app,0
Best music app hands down.,0
Great music,1
I would give it a higher rating but every time look up a song it puts a song completely different than what I looked up. For example I look up happier it puts on believer and also it says that my internet is weak,0
"I enjoyed a lot. I feel so happy, that I can hear a song where I want. I will give 5 star.",1
"I like Spotify even more now that there's lyrics to the songs. I also like Spotify because I can leave the app, do other things on my phone and still be able to listen to the music.",1
"DUDE WHEN I PLAY ONE MUSIC IN ONE SOUND IT WOULD SAY SOME OTHER MUSIC AND THEN PLAY THEM, I JUST WANT TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC I WANT TO PLAY NOT SOME OTHER GARBAGE I DONT EVEN LIKE!",1
"Downloaded songs get deleted once the premium pack that you have bought comes to end..and I just hate this feautureðŸ˜¤ I really thought that once I download a song, I can listen to it anytime even after the premium pack ends..it really disappointed me a lot",0
"I have Spotify premium but the sound quality is a bullsh*t, I don't know why YouTube has better sound quality and Spotify no (I use the High Quality in the settings of the sound).",0
Gave it 3 stars coz it says listen to no add songs for 30 mins and after every song it is showing me an add please correct it or should i find another app ?ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜¡ I heard about karaoke mode when is it gonna come hmm??,0
Good selection with excellent choices in a variety of formats.,1
Best App For Music. Has all the songs of the world including Anime and TV series as well. Loved it.,1
Price on everything,1
I like Spotify it's easy to play music you can have the music on even when you're not in the app,1
"Recent update is very buggy. No play controls in the app, crashes in background, randomly pauses. Also it's like the integration with Google home devices is completely broken too.",0
"This is a bad app. Resso is much better than Spotify. A song is repeated over and over again. I wanted to give it zero star, but There is no system for that. I'm uninstalling it.",0
This app has worked brilliantly until recently. It will no longer load up or play anything at all. For this reason I have uninstalled.,0
"Most of the songs I like is on there, and the one month free trial was somewhat helpful",1
"Nice app, but advertisements are annoying and can be disturbing",0
The ads are too much. I have to listen to atleast 1:30 minutes of ads and it kind of annoying. Please do something about it,0
"Why did they have to get ride of the preview of the song you want? Because it made it easy to know if it's the right song, and also the fact that if you want to add songs you don't know, you could jusy listen to a bit of it. You don't just look at the title and say ""oh yeah, this isn't a title of a song I've hear of before, and that there are many songs with similar names"" I don't get why you'd get ride of something so useful, I swear if it's only on premium-",0
"My Spotify keeps prompting offline even when on data. Have done troubleshoot, still same!",0
I still find the songs I want quick & easy.,1
It gets hung up sometimes interfacing with my vehicle's Bluetooth and won't recognize commands from my vehicle but other than that works pretty well,1
With this app am a very happy person because am learning through song messages,1
This app is nothing. It was all working but suddenly whatever songs that I tryna play but it plays another songs. I am deleting this app though.Sorry if I talk anything bad THAT hurts you. Sorry,0
"Not sure what is going on, but it pauses randomly and the display for the now playing never displays so I can't pause or FF or anything. 2stars bc it still plays, but if this doesn't get fixed I'm canceling my subscription. If I wanted my music to constantly pause I'd use YouTube.",0
"Good Quality and whatever but seriously, you want me to go premium to turn off Shuffle?! Madness, I'll uninstall and use another app.",0
Easy to use and great variety of music,1
"It's the beat app that is out there, especially for music and podcast.",1
Spotify is just great and some songs provide lyrics too,1
Its a good application,1
"I am uninstalling this app. The quality is good, as is the selection. The major issue I have is that the app opens automatically whenever my phone connects to my car's Bluetooth and automatically starts playing despite me trying everything I can find online to stop this. It is so frustrating and I just cannot deal with it any longer.",0
When all my favorite radio apps does not work well. Spotify is there for the rescue and out a And about n at work it helps me out. Thanks Spotify.,1
I am giving 4 star because its not showing the lyrics Pls can you fix that. Thank you.,0
So far so good. Still limited by only getting to choose one music genre/ style unless you make a playlist. I want the freedom to choose as many styles/genre's and be able to listen to music my way especially when I am paying for it. Has a large selection of music but is also missing a large selection.,0
Just awesome.....love this music app,1
"Excellent music, exceptional audio quality. I love it",1
"Ever since the most recent update I've been experiencing glitches constantly. When I'm playing music the play/pause/skip panel at the bottom (in app) and in my phone notification panel disappears. Struggles to content to my car through bluetooth,and music will randomly cut out.",0
"THE BEST app for listening to music. Like it's sooooo good I can't express in words. But i have 4 stars as there a many songs that I wanna listen not in there but available on YouTube. Otherwise, this app is my life",1
at least its not slow like the desktop version,1
Spotify constantly disconnects my bluetooth. Will not play songs. Pushs for Bluetooth. Why? Why are you pushing Bluetooth? I'm a hair away from canceling. Still no blocking capability! You're up to no goof like any other platform right now.,0
"Not impressed. I got tired of paying for a service that doesn't. The music randomly shuts off, I have to open the app for it to start playing again and it restarts the songs sometimes 3 times during the same song.",0
"So many songs, so little time...",1
"Spotify has all the music I need, always up to date as a result I have freed 5GB of storage on my phone. The fact that you can find local music native to Zambia on it, is mind blowing. Keep growing and we will support the cause.",1
"Sleep timer is crude -- no increments, no status. Update descriptions are vague, please link to a change log.",0
It's a really good app all the music you ever need and ist fats and easy to learn,1
Favorable app but ads more in this app,0
"Amazing, for a free app",1
Music constantly pauses by itself. I pay 'premium' but the service lately has been anything but. Has been doing this for a month now.,0
"Hii developers , I am facing problem in using spotify...my app opens normally and shows all option but when i enter in any playlist it only loads.. and by searching song the song doesnt start.. please help me Its been a week without music on spotify :(",0
"Year 2019: Too slow to obtain licenses for Japanese song Light Delight on release. Ascending: You people log onto MY DEVICES and remove FLAC audio files. Now: You have the right to remain silent. Application encrypts files, and the idea of playing ads when a subscription runs out.. A one-time purchase should remove ads permanently or on a higher delay, not this patented hyper-connect transmission control protocol mess with a 50 page document/ agreement. The market place is competitive.",0
Good music good set up,1
"Love it, able to choose songs, replay them and view lyrics. I LOVE IT",1
One of the best app I have in my phone! If you love music ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ then consider Spotify! All my taste buds of music at one place!!!,1
"i started using this app over pandora back in 2013? Only beause you could make playlists, thats it. I love listening to music but this app has more ads than before. I get that ads make the world go round, but why so many like 3-4 in a row and after every other song. I hear more ads than music on this app anymore. Instead of jamming out to music i am now jamming out to ads about tourism in the same state i live in!! Atleast YT lets you skip an ad.",0
No microphone icon to enable voice control. Needs an update?,0
Great music app. Only issue with it is that it sometimes stops. I have close it down and reopen it but this doesn't happen very often.,0
Too many adds... ridiculous,0
My experience with Spotify has been very pleasant,1
its not responding..everytime i try to play a song it returns to home screen,0
It's nice to use it allaw you to listen music's while using other apps,1
it is not showing the now playing bar and i have to stop the app to get it to come back and choose the album or songs all over again.,0
Best music experience without advertising,1
"Please fix now playing bar issue.... very annoying and hard to use for something ""premium"" will change back to 5 star after issue is resovled but right now it is like driving a car without a steering wheel!!!",0
Even worse 2day now I get dead spots in every song.. u guys were doing so good what's up??,0
I have been enjoying the music ðŸŽ¼ and all of my favorites are all right here!,1
App not working I literally cannot open this app and have to uninstall and reinstall it again and its bad don't know why??,0
Great job At last it has been updated that you are not able to play music without membership,1
"Spotify is such a great app, which makes finding and experiencing music so much easier. I love it.",1
"Enjoy Spotify, easy to use and find songs",1
Marked up to 3* as getting used to the app after repetition but needs polishing and simplification. Alphabetized library favourites and similar would be helpful. It's hard to find things when not in order.,0
"Free version, not worth it. But premium is way worth it. If you don't plan on paying for premium, don't get it. But if you do plan on getting premium their is no better music service",1
Its playing songs i dont wanna listen to very annoying make it stop!Stop playing song that arent even in my liked songs.When i want to listen to a song on my liked songs THERE ARE SUGGESTED SONGS I HATE IT AND I HATE THIS APP,0
I don't know what my life would be without Spotify but I'm glad I have it and will always have it.,1
Surprisingly a large amount of music isn't here. But the convenience is undeniable,1
"I'm one of the seven people who actually listens to the daily mix feature, and I like it because it's a good blend of songs and allows me to discover new music. However, over the past few months that feature has gone to garbage. There's no variety anymore, because it plays the EXACT same songs every single day. This feature is boring now. I have to resort now to enhancing my playlists, but it's really not the same. The rest of the app is great, but can you please fix this issue?",1
"From 5 to 1 star, due to the latest update. The play button MUST be in the center.",0
"This app is 100% one that I cannot live without on my phone. If you have premium, your experience is highly enhanced and refined to your tastes. This is my favorite music app.",1
"Recent updates have made the list of liked songs to disappear. New songs can't be visibly added to the list. If I go under an individual song I can see that it is liked, yet no songs appear in the playlist. It is possible to activate the list through Google Assistant. Sometimes when you press play on a podcast, nothing happens, and then you ha e to restart the app to get it to work. Edit: pressing play on a new podcast no longer works at all.",0
I think this is the best music app by far,1
"Probably the best music app that exist. Me Personally, I think this is The Best Music App ever. My OPINION.~~",1
Great Music Service App.,1
Ellame premium,1
Horrible experience with the ads and the behemoth worth of storage this app takes.,0
This ap have no hey mama ers remix and cj woopthy ers remix but so good app I love this app,1
I just want to play song from my playlists then I got kick out from the app. I can't play any song at allðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡.,0
Great Playlists and easy to use,1
"Constantly having to re-download my playlist to play offline, this is so annoying I'm looking for another music streamer.",0
This app is great! You can have lyrics and also listen to any song you want with kids around because Spotify cleans all the swear words out!!! From Daniel ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€,1
I love this app but the constant stopping is irritating ne to the point of canceling my subscription! I just updated 2 days ago and updating again. I really hope this update fixes the issue or I will be looking for a new app.,0
"I've used Spotify for years, and recently got premium, and premium is definitely better, but free is still great. It doesn't use as much data as Pandora or other streaming apps, and has so much music that you sometimes can't even find on YouTube.",1
always jumps to other singers. too stupid.,0
"When shuffling, the order of shuffle is still the same. Can you please make it in such a way that the shuffle order is different everytime then it would really be great since I love hearing songs on shuffle without any proper order.",1
Really comfortable music app for me! It have been me more happier) Thanks a lot!,1
After about 1 month of using spotify (free trial) it says that i have only 6 skips per day. But today i didnt go on it the whole day and it gave me 1-2 free skips idk as i didnt tough the app at all. Also on my playlist it adds random songs ive never herd of befor and sometimes it wont let me skip them. What do i do??,0
"Updated yesterday and now it isn't working. Tried logging in and out, switching device off and on, uninstall/reinstall of app, cleared cache, cleared data, tried with both mobile data and WiFi. Just the same unhelpful message 'something went wrong'. What am I doing wrong?",0
Love that it can be minimized and you don't have to pay to get a fair amount of listening time versus ads.,1
It's not letting me hear the music I want. Sometimes it stays playing by itself. Please fix this,0
"This app is so stupid now, it always plays unwanted songs, and every time when you listen to music you can't skip, pause or replay for some reaso, it's just so annoying and stupid. I wish I could give this stupid app 0 stars!",0
"If I've taken space on my phone to download music so i can play it without WiFi, I expect to be able to play it without WiFi!!!!",0
I love Spotify but the most recent update is an absolute disaster. The now playing banner constantly doesn't show meaning I have to force quit and relaunch just to skip a song. It also breaks all my headphone/car controls when this happens.,0
Uninstalled this app after using it for years. All the sudden when I turn my screen off the app acts like I have low signal or dead ear buds. Nothing has changed on my end but there was an update recently. Going with Pandora now. Hope they can keep it running right. Bye Spotify!,0
love this app but the lyrics option isn't available for me,0
"This app is trash now, crashes constantly",0
You stopped supporting connectivity to Nuvo. This is the only reason I have a subscription to Spotify. When will u fix this?,0
After the latest update Spotify deleted all the music I had downloaded and continues to delete everything I download every time I close Spotify.,0
I already subscribed to your spotify premium and still not working or opening to my device. I already emailed that I was having a hard time opening your app. Please fix spotify,0
Very nice app just download it but I hope we can do 5 pin playlit,1
App is easy to use and has lots of music to choose from.,1
"So if u want to listen whatever you want, haha you just need 5 dollar and if i cant listen whatever i want how i supposed to rate this programme 5 stars or 4, thats the only 1 problem i see, musics and others awsome for me.",0
Not impressed. Drops connection To Bluetooth,0
Good,1
"(26/06/21) App used to be really good but now since the updates. it keeps telling me I have no internet connection, and wont let me search my downloaded songs. Plus payments have gone up and barely get any use out of the app.. as it won't let you use it offline even though you've paid the fee..hopefully this will be resolved soon. And it is still the same(26/06/22) if not worse I am wanting to cancel my memebership and use another service because of this rubbish",0
I really like it here every one is very nice and I now I will always come hear,1
10/10 WOULD RECCOMEND but if you do use I also would recommend Spotify premium,0
"This app is trash, needs premium to anything ðŸ˜¤ðŸ™„, Can't listen to Any songs I like, always bringing me to Another song, I'm already giving credit on Streaming An Artist and you can't even let me do that!!! ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž",0
"It keeps crashing, I couldn't even play a song and it already exits me out of the app.",0
"I need to update but until then it is really bad because when you play a song, instead of playing that song it plays like 100000000 others and it takes REALLY long so yeah",0
All my music plus more,1
I love Spotify. It's the only app I pay for.,0
"After receiving criticism for platforming nazis and promoting the spread of pseudoscientific misinformation, Spotify implemented some changes. The changes failed to address the actual issue, but were implemented broadly enough to negativity impact innocent parties. Despite being an excellent source of music streaming, it seems the company has systemic issues which likely start at the board of directors, and trickle all the way down. SAD.",0
Love this app it is the best out there in my opinion but I wish there was more then 6 skips and when you look up a song you do have to go through a whole playlist to find the one song! But I still love the app,1
I love it cant live without music honestly,1
Why does it keep switching the storage location to Internal storage? It's so annoying.,0
"Buggy mess of an app, the shuffle is also not a shuffle! Just the same loop of songs repeated, certainly not random!",0
"1) If I search for a song, I dont want a shuffled playlist that contains that song somewhere in it. I want to listen to that song. 2) Why does changing playlists/songs instantly start another round of ads for 30min of ad free music, if I literally just got done listening to 3 ads saying I have 30min of free music? Get more accuracy and less ads on Youtube all places...",0
It's very meh idk what happened with the latest update but I can't see what song is playing or skip or go back I'm a premium user,0
I love Spotify it works awesome and I've found so much more music I enjoy while using it!!!,1
It's very good app for huge collection of all languages songs,1
No need to say anthing but the fact that its just good,1
Good but add a fixture to download music,1
Play button is not showing on my s20+,0
"For an app that say you play your music from your Playlist, it sure doesn't let you do that and that sucks. 1Star",0
"Ur the bomb cut I can play my games while listening to music, I just wish I could make own play list, like on ""You Tube Music"". Love â¤ï¸ thanks a lot, Joanne Kimmons",1
We can listen the any song/music anywhere and can stop anywhere,1
"shuffle play in a playlist. except it's not really shuffled. every time i play a playlist in shuffle, i feel like the same songs are always being played first over and over again, which isn't very fun for long playlists, and it gets very repetitive. but other than that spotify is a pretty good app for streaming music in the background !,",1
"this apps really good, i have the student package which is good cause i means im not paying too much. the only bad thing is i cant seem to be able to sort my playlists on the app, like by most recently added, but i can on the desktop app, would be really nice to add this feature please",1
"I love this app. The only thing it is lacking is an ""adventuresomeness button"". Id like to be able to indicate to the app how adventuresome I feel each day, which would tell the algorithm to surprise me, or keep me safely in my audio comfort zone.",1
Best music app ever keep up the excellent work and don't worry about the cancel culture there idiots.,1
I loved it till it got stuck on shuffle & since I have a free account I can't take it off. So annoying. Can't listen to the songs I want because they won't play & it's playing songs I'm not interested in but I can't change because it's stuck on shuffle. I'm going back to my other music platforms till that gets fixed because I can't listen to anything I like or want because of it. Super disappointed.,0
"All of a sudden i cannot pause or skip . The playback bar is gone . Very annoying, I'm going to delete Spotify and cancel account if this isnt fixed .",0
Would love if they made local files better for mobile because it keeps glitching. Add more functionality to sleep timer. Make it so we can stop when the queue ends.,0
"Please fix whatever hot mess you have made of the android app. It doesn't show up on my lockscreen, I can't play and stop the songs and see a progress bar, and it has started to frequently just stop playing songs. I am uninstalling and reinstalling on a daily basis to somehow fix these bugs.",0
I loved this app but now not so much as the music keeps stopping and starting or sometimes won't even start again unless I close the app,0
"VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO USE, At the beginning it was not like this but now, what the hell is (shuffle play!) l searched countless times but l can't find just one single play button Whenever l play a song some random song play's by it'self and lf go more deep and then again click on the song only main words begin's and then ends please you had to co-oporate with us and people have become so greedy that almost every app includes (sign in, rate us, pay now to install premium etc)",0
I really hate the update!! It made it so hard to listen to songðŸ˜¡ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¡ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¡ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¡ðŸ”¥ 0 star review UGH UGH UGH!!,0
Plays when getting in a car no matter if you want it or not,0
PLEASE ADD A PLAY NEXT OPTION! I don't like the updates it get worse every time. Old versions were better. Want the good old simple classic features. The made for you playlists are nice. Can't u guys limit the ads? And keep the 30-minutes- interruption-free-if-you-watch-the-ad promise? Suckers. We need a select-multiple option to select multiple songs to add to playlist. That's really a need! And u should have hide song feature for our own personal playlists too,0
"I can't buy premium, it always unable to connect pls fix this",0
wow ,1
It don't never put on the songs that I asked for to put on that's annoying,1
I think spotify just need to hire a punjabi employee to right a perfect punjabi lyrics for punjabi songs then it will be excillent as there are many listener who wants to sing a song while listening as me ðŸ˜. I just noticed that there are many wrong lyrics over there. Overall it is good app,1
"Update:- Thank You Spotify For Resolving below mentioned Issue.... ""Everything's great but lyrics are not displayed... Not resolved till now... My device is Mi A3, till date this lyrics issue is not solved...""",0
"Great app,, nice ui,, smooth experience,, great music quality,, less ads,, ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘,, awesome app ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘",1
"Still the best streaming app for music , but only if you got the premium version . Add recommendations in Spotify is the worst among all other apps .",0
i like listing to music just make it so you can only watch the ones you want that you saved when you finish you go on some radmon ones,1
Spotify needs some help after using for a few weeks it previewed only I mean the song stops after 10 secs I tried really hard ðŸ˜… but it was broken,0
I love Spotify! It has all the songs I will probably ever listen to. The UI is wonderful and easy to maneuver around.,1
App easy to use and no glitches ever. Love diverse music collections!,0
It's trash i can't even listen to the music.,0
I love listening to music and I love this app,1
I love the music and the other entertainment on the site.so thank you for this music,1
"Fantastic, got so much music on YouTube. However!! Spotify is THE sure victor in algorithm, in amount of music I have saved, convenience, and even winner in which I've bought premium for; YouTube being zero and Spotify more than once. Save 5000 songs and let Spotify pick the next 5k. You'll be happy, obsessed, and addicted. Spotify will have your back.",0
"Been a good time using spotify for the most part. I enjoy the easy access and mobility of all features available paying, because without it, your annoyed. Otherwise yeah, good times wah. See how it goes been using for a year or so, so at like 12$ cad good to roll i guess, cause how else is their music these days unless your buying this subscription stuff?",1
"Your app has too many bugs, can't sync with desktop",0
"This app continually selects shuffle, even though I keep turning it off - why?",0
"Would be perfect except that there seems to be an app flaw that causes blue tooth headphones to lose connection. One often has to open the app to get music playing again. I don't know if it's a Huawei/Android/Spotify issue, but I know it doesn't happen when Spotify is playing through my computer, or when watching a Netflix show. It needs to be sorted out, because it's stopping me giving *****.",0
The last time i updated this app. It crashes everytime i press the play button. It doesn't play the song. It always exits everytime i play a song. Will you please fix this? I am on a PREMIUM ACCOUNT and I don't deserve this kind of service. Thank you.,0
Rewind and fast forward options work occasionally,1
Was good but doesn't work properly with a bunch of radios that have control of the app via touch screen anymore. So I may stop paying soon and just go with the free version or another app.,0
Easy to navigate and so many songs!,1
"I love Spotify. It has some amazing artist and Podcaster. The thing is tho that if they decide to go the route of ""wokeism"" they will lose alot of listeners. Spotify is still one of the only main media companies not suppressing free speech. Don't do it Spotify listen to the people that actually support you.",0
"This app is very... good but I don't find my favourite song on this app, please add this song for me, the song name is 'POISON', singer is Wang Yizhi from China. It's a song of a movie, that movie name is 'ARSENAL MILITARY ACADEMY'. And I don't find this song also, this song name is 'MAIN ZAMEEN TU ASMAAN'. Please Developer add these songs for me please... ðŸ™ðŸ» When you add these songs, then I will change my rate of this app 1 star to 5 star. â­-â­â­â­â­â­",0
"Abysmal Podcast Player. Hey Spotify, go look at a real podcast player and figure this out. Your sorting/selecting/downloading/playing of Podcasts it horrendous.",0
Please add music videos! Either way it's still a 5 start review from me! I go insane with ads so it's a must to pay for a premium music service.,0
Fantastic,1
Still mixes songs even after selecting group by artist.,1
Trash keeps tossing my player so I have to uninstall and reinstall daily. Lame.,0
Really good app. Can at music in the background without premium. Not much ads at all. Great app. Reccomend,1
This app always dies on me when I finally have time to listen to music,0
Thank you...you brought back the young girl in me! Love looking up the old music from the 80s,1
App is amazing but we don't listen songs offline,1
Its realy super Even he FREE version is almost as good as premium,1
"I love this app.I can search for all kind of music, especially smooth jazz. Thank you",1
"Great music streaming app, the only downside is that random playback is always the same order of songs!",0
"This Is so beautiful, I'm relaxing to heat the music in spotify",1
"Not sure why, but I can't seems to download Spotify. ðŸ˜•",0
I'm loving my experience. Great variety of music and podcasts. Only downside is needing wifi for music that isn't downloaded.,0
The app works just fine but this is the definition of to many ads it makes it almost hard to enjoy your music without them bothering you 24/7 about premium it's very annoying I know that's how they get you to buy it but come onnnn,0
"I almost like everything about Spotify. However, currently I've been facing some problems like the player closing mid playing of the songs or the current song not being visible. Some of the songs which were available in my country earlier are not available anymore.",0
"Amazing music. But most recently they are telling me every month that the payment failed and I should update my payment settings. When trying to do so they first try to give me the more expensive option (duo) and when I select the normal subscription only yearly payment can be done via credit card. Monthly as I'm usually doing it is only possible via paysafe card... Who in the world is still using these? Looks to me like cashflow optimization, not cool",0
Very easy to install and use.,1
"I have been using this app for 2 years now.. I pay for no ads because they are annoying. It used to be great. Now the app itself is just becoming more and more frustrating. It take 3 or more tries to even get the app to start. And then once it does its iffy if its gonna let me do anything. The home page NEVER updates so all my daily mixes are always the same songs. Also, having to update the app EVERY DAY is a bit ridiculous. I left Pandora for this. â˜¹",0
"It's a cool music app, I can find all the songs that I want to play",1
Fix your APP!!!!!! It keeps bugging out!!! When i press play...i cant press stop!!!! This is sooooo annoying!!!!!!!!!!,0
Can you guys not play random songs when Im trying to listen to my playlist Thanks,1
It's the best music app available in the market change my mind and takeâ‚¹1000,1
"Itâ€™s the best App I have ever used for listening music. There are numerous options, playlists and specially blends.Spotify really knows me well. It creates playlists by my favourite songs which is appreciated. Artist mix,genre mix,mood mix these are so good. I like using Spotify. But I wish there were a few more advantages for those who use a free account. For example skipping more than 6 songs.",1
I would like there to be an option for play next not only add to queue and if I want to add an album to queue I would like the current album I'm playing to still be playing not the one I added to queue I would also like to be able to shuffle it after adding it queue but what we really need is a play next option...,0
"Even though internet is connected, it shows as offline.",0
"The mobile version of spotify used to me so good, but now with the 6 skips per hour, I would recommend not bothering with the mobile version, and just using the pc version.",0
Mzemer,1
I've been using Spotify for years and never has it even given me problems!!,0
The phone version of the app is frustratingly dumb. Can't play songs in any order and only on shuffle?? I'm definitely sticking to PC and tablet only.,0
"I paid and you switched my plan to individual and deleted my family's accounts. I can't even contact anyone to cancel this payment and fix it. We've had our family account for years. This is VERY unprofessional. I'm beyond livid. Update: I contacted support and there is nothing they can do. Years of our music is gone, they lied about what they were going to charge me, and changed it AFTER I hit submit, and they can't fix it. Be weary before you buy.",0
Very beautiful app ... Easy and all of songs is available ... ForÃ§a barÃ§a â¤ï¸ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¦,1
Love Spotify any music I want,1
Why does this app crash when i open it? Been doing this a couple days now its annoying,0
"The music options are great, podcasts are great, but functionally it doesn't work half the time. You play a song and there is a bug that causes the app not to show the pause and play buttons. They don't reappear until I restart my phone. Have to force close the app to stop playing anything. Can't skip any songs. Really an app breaking bug.",0
"Most of the songs from any genre are available. Like it. And, easy to use.",1
Great app to listening any songs with high quality. App works properly and it can handle easily.,1
"Please help, my downloaded songs keep disappearing. I've downloaded hundreds of songs over and over again, and they keep dissapearing. Why??",0
Adding to the misinformation of covid is not a platform I want to be apart of. It's also trash when you're driving with the sheer number of pop ups,0
"Great content great features learning listening preference is very good. what else can one say. Except Android version falls on its face using ""add local files"". There is no way to specify which folder. So it adds everything. Voice messages, recorded notes. Ringtones , notifications, themes from other apps. Makes the option useless. However the PC version is well done. Maybe just a smarter team of developers. Hope the PC team will offer lessons to android team. All it needs is 1 folder.",0
Awesome app,1
The ideal app for melodious music,1
I took a break from Spotify to explore other music apps and when I came back they had updated the app which makes it very difficult to play your music. Don't know why they made it worse than it was,0
BEST,1
"This app is okay but the annoying thing about this is when I listening to music it stops in the middle of songs, or when I want to listen to like Wait a minute! by Willow I have to listen to other songs that I don't like and I have to wait an hour to skip and it's super annoying",0
"Too many ad,s but good",1
Completely bugged since last update.,0
I Love the play lists that you offer.lots of adds,1
Too much time takes to launch,0
"Still finding my way around and back ! But was tickled pink to find some good ""ancient"" music in a flash .",1
"I've had a fantastic time using Spotify,you can any artist or song into the search box & you be right at the artist album along with other singers or himself.",1
"I went into an area where my phone service didn't work and I've lost all of my music when the app closed out and booted me off of my account, which I can't get back into. The amount of ads being 4 to 5 every other song.",0
I've had this app for years now but lately it consistently stops and then the display bar is gone. I've had to uninstall and reinstall it SEVERAL times now. I think it might be time for a change,0
Songs don't always stay downloaded,0
"Was great for the 14 day trial. After that nothing but adds. Went back to my old streaming service, for free. Guess I should have paid more attention to the reviews and wouldn't have wasted my time.",0
"I don't like Spotify. This is the reason for full time advertisement in continues 3,4 advertisement playing at a time continuesily.",0
Brings variety of artists to be accessed with ease.challenge is that music can be accessed or played with internet only.,1
ads more than songs,0
"Good setup, I like the combination and variety of music, podcasts.",1
I'm enjoy the simplicity of finding the music.,1
Easy to make a playlist of your favorite artists.,1
"This recent update is making my app act up, can it be patched up. The app would crash now and then",0
Love the app with everything I have but why am I being told 'No Internet connection available' when I have one. It's frustrating but I know you'll fix it soon ðŸ’š,0
Best music app i have ever tested,1
"Terrible update, I made playlists for to pick specific songs I'd like to listen, now forced to use shuffle. I can't drag the timestamp too, no freedom at all. - edit Wow I can't even play the song I've search SPECIFICALLY, nice. :-)",0
Idk what happens to the app everything I search is just buffering with full network,0
First time user of music streaming I guess it's called. It's very user friendly for my phone and vehicle.,0
Its a good app its has a bit of adds bit for the ads removal u can always use premium,1
Refuses to work on my phone works fine on other devices have tried all steps to get it to work with zero success not good enough for something I pay for.,0
Even though data is on.. It shows offline no connection to data,0
Frequent widget crashes now since my last update. And it has to be reinstalled a few times to act like it used to.,0
"Fantastic. Works well with an Alexa, which was not very compatible with apple. Users can interact and share content quite easily.",1
Spotify is such a great app and I'm extremely happy with the service/benefits since I've started using the app. I give it an unquestionable 5 star!!,1
Stop adding music i dont want it i just want to listen to my songs 4 damn songs,0
"It's gone buggy ....since a few days Spotify stops intermittently plus the track playing screen has disappeared and remote controls no longer work. Please fix, extremely annoying.",0
"10 out of 10 homework is so much more bearable now, thanks.",1
"Been using and paying for spotify for several years and I upgraded my phone to Samsung Z fold3 and now when I play in my car and go to get out there's no pause button, actually no buttons so I have to force stop the app or uninstall so the music will stop playing out loud on my phone... someone help what's wrong before I cancel my subscription",0
Everything great except for the music play aftrer app is closded,0
This is a little good app because it is free for only first 1 month But i uninstall it and again install it every monthðŸ˜ðŸ˜ and music search is very good,1
Good ,1
The app is very easy to use. Easy to search for songs. I just wish there was a easier way to add songs to your playlist but still can be done with no trouble. I recommend this app. I'm a premium user so this app is easier to use. No ads no crashing. Smooth app with premium. Car mode in app makes it mush easier while driving. You have options to keep the app open when in car mode or default to screen out.,0
Super,1
"When ur playing music, typically the song shows up at the bottom of page on on the lock screen - this feature is malfunctioning and the current song playing is gone.",0
Cant see how many songs in a playlist anymore. Dumb change. Can't skip song from notification bar anymore. Spotify doesn't even have anything in notifications anymore.,0
Best music app I really enjoy it when I'm depressed or happy .ðŸ˜… Anything anytime just spotify â£ï¸ Music is the medicine for everything ðŸ’•ðŸ’ž,1
"was good until this last update, now it randomly crashes and is just very frustrating to work with",0
App is set not to play in the background. It still keeps randomly turning itself on. A few times music starts playing and I don't even see the app in my open apps. And no one has access to my account.,0
I like listening to songs it calms me down,1
Awesome music and video,1
Its very entertaining the Albums are super great. I enjoyed music more and more.,1
Very nice music platform,1
"it was good but add a option to listen to only that one song like ""The Final Countdown"" when you want to play it and only listen to it add a button that only listen to that song on repeat",0
The music selection is fine but the app has been unfinished for years. Now it just auto plays without a control bar. The devs get sloppier and more careless as time goes on.,0
Im not sure on what happened but know that I got to the end of my playlist I cant go back and listen to MY music but it continues to playbthe recommended music no matter what I do,1
Update has made it keep skipping its ridiculous,0
"Covid spam, crashing, hard to navigate. Takes forever to load list of episodes. No fast forward. Buy premium to skip song lol.",0
Always on point and convenient as a premium member I don't use anything else but Spotify,0
Its great! But i just dont like the ads cuz i always keep seeing it so i will rate spotify 3/5 so yea ðŸ˜,1
It's ok just adds are not 30 min apart,1
"Having issues with the app, when I play a song, the window to press play, rewind or fast forward, and skip, doesn't pop-up. I have to close the app and reopen it everytime to get it to work properly.",0
"I really love Spotify because it supports a lot of features for free!!! It also contains ads but they are very less in this app, I don't even need to download the songs I want to listen!!! In my opinion (Spotify is the BEST)",1
It has so much bugs nowadays that it shows No Internet even if the connection is there. And I couldn't access songs that I have saved and liked. I couldn't listen to music on this platform so Time to switch the music app!,0
Love the additional perksaudiobooks  AI DJ  videos  and lyrics,1
I cant open this years wrapped before the app crashing two seconds into the first slide. Please fix this,0
Ok so I can't play my favorited music it says that there is an error and won't load I will raise the stars whenever you find a fix.,0
Love Spotify!!! Everyday I'm listening to my favorite jams!!! Thanks for the enjoyment from your service...,1
the app is very easy to use and it sounds great! my problem with it is that it keeps playing suggested songs in my all my playlists even though it has over 50 artists and songs in it.,0
"Ever since the new updat 4/5/22, spotify keeps crashing, pausing, my now playing button has disappeared and the feature for my to change the song without opening the app won't work and is always showing the wrong information",0
"The overall experience is good. Asian songs, especially Chinese songs have less resources. The UI of the lyrics display module can be more beautiful.",1
"I think something broke in the app, as the play/pause button is suddenly off to the left side instead of in the middle of the back and forward buttons. It looks really really weird, though at least the buttons still with correctly I guess???",0
Best app for songs ,1
"Most annoying app ever. forces you to listen to complete songs from artist you do not like. Saying slow down, you only get six skips per hour. I can understand happen to watch a commercial but to make me listen to a complete song before I can move on?",0
Good wark for you to,1
I don't understand why sometimes I get a genre mix when I choose to listen to a specific artist. It's irksome.,0
Wide range of songs collection,1
"The song quality and the service , everything is fantastic but i would like to have caller tunes so that everyone who calls me can enjoy the taste of music ..",1
This is a really good music app and i WOULD recommend to use Me my family and all my friends use it Its just a super good app for music and podcasts There is really good music its easy to use its free Who wouldnt want it,1
"An amazing music platform, makes it easy to find new music, share music with my friends, and there are even a ton of optional social features that really make Spotify special. I only wish you could pin more playlists",1
"This app was one of my bests until an update came and since then I've been experiencing difficulty playing any music of my choice Before I'd click on it then it started playing, but now different things just come up making it annoying and repelling",0
The same issue every other second person is reporting. The transport controls (play/pause etc) disappear. Will review again when it's fixed.,0
Worst app . Very irritating. Ads are irritating me ðŸ™„,0
"Control bar missing. Uninstalled this app the other day to fix it. But have to download all my fav playlist again. When I opened it today, control bar is missing again. It's so annoying.",0
Would give 5 star if they had less ads honestly ruins the app and in 2022 only rich people cab afford premium bc we all broke,0
I really really love this app because I could listen to my music and not always get a adds un like yt but the prob is idk what happen but whenever the add comes and the music suddenly will go off idk why it does that but yea this app works for me,1
"Rubbish, I have paid for and used this service for years but its turned into garbage. Constant stopping, controls disappear etc etc. I have cancelled my Subscription, not worth the $$ anymore.",0
"I understand that mobile apps are design to be handle by touch, but I think that your web player or your tablet versions could have drag and drop, making it easy to reorder playlists and songs in a playlist, instead of going through a menu. Obviously Windows version is more user friendly in this sense. Spotify could be such a great app if the developers understood how their clients use it. Please add drag and drop to mobile apps, or at least to the web player. I'm and android user, by the way!",0
"Good app, sorry about the bad review earlier I might have got mad because of my songs weren't playing, they still aren't but its a good app because good recommendations",1
"It doesn't play the music I like, it doesn't leave my main screen. I just hate it",0
One of the best apps I downloaded so far. I get great use out of it.,1
So many songs to listen.ðŸ‘¨â€ðŸŽ¤,1
"It's good but.., i feel frustrate when add is coming ðŸ¤ª",1
This app is really Very Good also Useful Every Song Lyrics.,1
"I have had spotify for a couple months now and I have not had one problem with it! It's great, all the music you can think of. This is why I reccomend spotify and why I gave it 4 stars. Great app!",1
"Fix your damn app, keeps pausing music when connected on bluetooth device, very often gets stuck, doesn't show what it's playing sometimes but plays music in background. What are we paying for??",0
Use spotify for everything love it!!!!,1
Worse music app I have ever had in my existence you can only have 6 skips per hour and can't even choose what song you want to listen to its really bad I will change my mind on the app and say it's good when your able to pick what song you wanna listen too,1
Couldn't live without it now. Not keen on how ' woke ' it's becoming though ! Recommending a lot of tripe repeatedly,0
Just thank you! Music gives me so much motivation.,1
I can't listen to any music on my playlist,0
I basically live on spotify but sometimes I have to delete then reinstall it because the play/pause bar glitches.,0
"Personally I believe the student plan should include high school and maybe even middle school, other than that I think this app is perfect",1
Good,1
Its my stress reliever and i really enjoy the music quality,1
Good app however there are some problems when I'm skipping through a song it sometimes doesn't skip to that part and I have to try again it isn't that major but still quite annoying I know it isn't cause my WiFi is slow since its 500mbps,0
"There is a bug The controls at the bottom of the app do not show up and it doesn't show in my notifications bar so I have to close the app to stop the music. It doesn't pause my music if I watch Netlfix, YouTube or Tik tok. I also can not use the widget to play my music",0
"Premium user. Love the app, but today for over five hours now, it's been telling me 'No internet connection,' which isn't true because every other mobile data-reliant app on my phone is working. I have switched off my phone, cleared cache, uninstalled the app, redownloaded. But now I can't even sign in because it keeps saying 'No Internet connection.' This sucks!",0
None of my playlists are opening on my mobile app. Not a single song can be played.,0
Nice audio quality and great collection,1
"I do love Spotify! Even pay for no ads, some days the app is finicky but gets resolved pretty quickly so no complaints here ðŸ‘",0
"Dear Spotify Team, Why can't you add the feature : adding to queue by swiping right on the song, to Android. You have it already ok IOS but not on Android and I don't understand why. About the rest, it's great if you have Premium, else its not really useful on your Smartphone.",0
It have very nice Playlist,1
Fantastic app performance as to listening loved songs,1
Optima,1
"For Music, you can't beat Spotify. But for podcasts, it's beginning to get ridiculous. Before April 2022 there were very few ads while listening. The ads were at the front of a podcast so you could listen without interruption. I'm not saying ads are bad, but now, there are a minimum of 3 ads or more every 10 minutes! Why do the ads just pop out randomly?! A 30 min podcast has at least 6-8 in it. WHY ?!",0
I give a star because you introduced ads and the application from the last update is weird.,0
Every second day i have to reinstall the app and clear cache because when i try to shuffle liked songs it only plays songs that arent in the playlist. It started around christmas and hasnt stopped since. When the app worked it was really good but now Im praying the next song is one in my playlist Literally just had to reinstall after less than an hour since the last time. Please fix this,0
Very good and easy to use with enough futures,1
It's good but not being able to use it when am dataless hit so hard ðŸ˜Œ,0
good app but will randomly disconnect and freeze,0
"This app is the best! it has all the songs you can listen to, and plus, it dosen't even give adds so its the best! for all those complainers out there saying you can get a better app to listen to music, YOUR WRONG!!!!!!!!!!! you cant. spotify is the best its even top #3 on best music.SO PLEASE DOWNLOAD IT, its free so you dont have to purchase anything so please read my review thank you so much! Even you spotify!!!",1
It could be a great app if commercials wouldn't yell in your ear when you try to listen to some music after every 3 songs. I understand that a free version can't work as paid one but this is ridiculous and extremely annoying,0
Since I updated the app won't open.,0
Nice and clear music to listen to.,1
Used to be great but is very spotty now. Pauses songs in the middle without prompt.,0
You used to be able to set up a playlist even without prime. But these days no go without them shoving their own songs onto your playlist. You also can't repeat a song or playlist. Pandora is looking better and better. You also can't see your playlist without moving back and pushing 5 buttons. It makes you work too hard. Very frustrating.,0
This is very nice app for music fans,1
It wont start at the top of the playlist if you want it to.,1
"Worked perfectly until I started paying This app worked perfectly for years until I decided to try the free trail. Now my control bar has disappeared, my played podcasts are coming up as unplayed, I've lost podcasts I was subscribed to. I won't be renewing my subscription if the premium doesn't even work",0
"Everything was excellent. However, they seem to have removed the feature to listen to a short preview of a song when making a Playlist. This has made it impossible to find new songs you are interested in for your Playlist. Horrible feature to remove.",0
This platform is really awesome but premium is little bit higher In price so that yt music is more Better option than that because of affordable price with video features and minimal primium range one premium for everyone .,1
This stupid app has been harassing me about a podcast I already listened to for weeks and keeps bringing it up to listen again.,0
Great for Spotify,1
"Easy to use & the selection is fabulous. I feel for the musicians who make less money with streaming, but times have changed.",1
Amazing,1
Gr8 app hase most listened music on it use it everyday,1
"I love Spotify, it's my only Musica app",0
What's up with the ads? I've been using this app for ages and just suddenly I am getting 2-3 ads for every 2-3 songs. It's crazy!,0
"I could given five but now, I've released how hard it is to use the Spotify. Especially when it comes to opening an Artis account, it really hard. I've tried it many times but it seems impossible even Spotify Technical support is not the best, not helping at all. Otherwise it quite simply to find and stream on it, that's what I can only recommend for people.",0
"Great variety. I don't use premium, but still able to enjoy variety if music and pod casts.",1
"So bad, they keep adding songs to your playlists, and when you remove them more and more come",0
"Buggy and Slow, keeps showing No Internet available. Even when it is connected to internet. Re-login is a nightmare sometimes almost gave me a heart attack thinking I will have to build my liked songs list again. Good song collection and sound quality though.",0
"You guys really managed to Mess this one up, I pay $15 per month so that I can listen to music podcast and when I decid to do so this thing keeps crashing every 5 songs or so? fix it now.",0
Definitely a great music an podcast app. Easy to navigate thru the app.,1
"The start/stop/shuffle etc button has recently dissapeared on my Android. Also, it stops mid song.",0
Superb music app!!,1
Spotify is the only platform I use to stream music but y'all have to come with the solution of songs that can't play sometimes,0
Very good quality old school music I love Spotify,1
Work really well with Android Auto on those long drives home.,1
It has some nuisances but it's alright,1
"Professional, good quality of sound of music, complete music library, and still available for free package choice! I like it!!!",1
As of late. Spotify won't give controls when playing on my phone. It doesn't show the lyrics. You can't pause or stop play b/c it doesn't show the controls. I have to restart my phone and it doesn't show the current or last song played. And I pay for this app.,0
Outstanding quality of sound....and affordable!!!,1
"Decided to give this app a shot because of Joe Rogan. Will update my stars if I run into any issues with the app but so far so good! Edit: Nevermind, you blinked first. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile. Bye!",1
"Yes Spotify is good, but I just think that you should have more skips per hour, and not have to play for premium. And if you don't waste all your 6 skips, add it to the next hour. I think that will give me 5 stars. Also, whenever I watch a video to get the 30 minutes of ad free music, IT DOESNT WORK. Please fix that.",0
I love Spotify when it's not mobile. I absolutely HATE the mobile its terrible you can't even skip songs. I really wish they would change it up just a bit.,0
Always trying to force premium on me. Not wanted as only use occasionaly. Boring as well.,0
5 gold starts,1
"It would be a 5 star if only it didn't occassionally bounce to other random songs when I don't have shuffle on, then again it may just be me, but for the most part it's pretty good to use for music and stuff",1
"It was very good,but premium is very expensive and I love to listen to the music . I wish premium was cheaper and the free version could do offline streaming .",1
Listening activity should there on phone too,0
some other songs are not available like BTS song and other Things is ok Please sort out this thing why BTS Songs is not available,0
Much improved over the last 2 yrs. Very good app.,1
"I love the new way to search songs. You can just write part of the lyrics of the song, and it finds exactly the song I'm looking for.",1
So i really liked this app so much but idk what happened Spotify started to lag very much and it took so long to play a song or open a playlist all of my playlists and liked songs are in Spotify i really wanna change my song app but I can't only those playlists and liked songs are holding me back please Spotify resolve this issue I'm frustrated..,0
So far past month been using it and comparing with Apple music. It's not bad... I like how it connects with my alexa and car. The UX feel is good and able to navigate around fine. I do like how I can switch devices to play music which is convenient.,1
"the reason why i have gived this app a 2 star is because, i dont like where you cant play music without it shuffling and need to pay for premium for you to choose any song you want to play without shuffling, i just find that greedy and please remove that its really annoying and i guess i might have to change to something else in the mean while for my music unil you remove that.",0
2 stars becuase its a way to listen to music when playing xbox but the amount of ads you get ruins the whole thing. 4 songs and then 6 ads is what i tend to get most the time. Im looking for alternatives so i can listen to music on my xbox without being bombarded with ads,0
"A really good platform, if you're developing artist",1
Waking up and hearing love songs are food for the soul.,1
"Been a premium user for a long time, want to tell me why songs/podcasts are stopping halfway through with no play/pause and no slide bar hud whatsoever?",0
Amazing app I love the music thanks for the best quality â¤ï¸,1
Got the tunes I love and sends great recomendations,1
Despite paying the subscription even when I'm offline and have my playlist downloaded the minute I go offline it stops my music refuses to let me continue to listen till I have access to wifi.,0
The best music app Good sound quality,1
What the hell is this new update it's abosulty awful. The UI is confusing I cannot even listen to a specific song.,0
The perfect streaming service for music If you have premium or not you still have access to every song,1
Best music app around.,1
Love it!! Great opportunity to hear great music.,1
"Too many ads, can't listen to one song with getting 4 to 5 ads after it no matter what",0
"You cant choose what songs you listen too, ads come on lealry after every 2 songs very very bad, aswell as most songs dont work! Moving too soundcloud",0
"Works like a charm. People wring 1 star reviews claiming the app is glitchy and butt hurt ""progressives"" easily triggered. Ignore them.",0
"awful app. if you need to buy premium just to play the songs you want, might aswell put Spotify not for free. because i cant even listen to the songs i want to listen and could only skip 6 songs an hour.",0
"I've seen worse UI and UX work on other apps, but not many.",0
I use Spotify a lot and enjoy the range of music available. I have been introduced to more artists which great!,1
It's a very good app for listening music.,1
Really like it. Quite intuitive.,1
"I had to delete spotify because it wouldn't let me log in at all even tho my internet working perfectly it keeps saying ""no internet connection try again"" i've tried everything and i just deleted the app out of frustration.",0
"Terrible app experience. Keeps pausing, controls aren't shown. After having premium for years I am strongly considering ditching Spotify completely. Why pay for a service that doesn't work?",0
Spotify has been my resort to any event. ðŸ˜Š,0
"I've had this the last 3 years didn't have any problems til just a week ago. Can't see the songs that's playing. I can't pause a song, so I have to close the whole app. And after playing 3 songs it just stops playing. Fix or I'll cancel",0
Easy and joyful,1
I cant live without Spotify! Primarily I listen daily for the great selection of Podcasts.,1
Amazing song selection and great collection,1
One day I was listening to music and could not listen to song's I love only the suggestion ones witch I thought weren't good! I tried to listen to the ones I love in every way! It's no good. The only way is to get premium witch cost money. I'm not spending money to listen to songs. I'm sorry Spotify it's a good app but I can't use it. ðŸ¥º But still I will give it a good rating because either way it's a good app!,1
Love the app interface but needs to improve on enlisting many more songs and artists etc. Love the podcasts and radio channels too.,0
Hi ðŸ‘‹ this app Spotify is very nice ðŸ‘ðŸ» But some few problems are there ðŸ˜³ Other wise this app is amazing like There sound quality etc ðŸ¤© thank you very much â˜ºï¸ you must install this app Spotify ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜¯ BYE ðŸ™ðŸŒˆðŸ’œðŸŒˆðŸ’œ,1
ðŸ‘ amazing! I often have to restart app to fix glitch but worth it!,1
Love it,1
"No doubt, the only music streaming app worth paying for the premium service. No second thoughts, coming from an audiophile and fan of any and all genres across the board. Love discovery, and love revisiting old and nearly forgotten faves, as quick as I can search. Run-on sentence? Sorry Mrs. McGuckin, you old hag!",0
I was told every couple songs there be a add. I heard ads playing for 20 minutes. After reaching the end of your play last it stops and weat for me to press play on my phone again very dangerous if you have it to play music while driving. Put enhance mode on and after it played my play list it started playing garbage I would never listen to,0
Love it all. I can play most anything on demand. And I dig the newish lyrics feature!!!,1
"Found it easy to use , great music selection brilliant ðŸ‘",1
App was good but now shuffle plays the same songs 3 times in 8 hours and I have over 32 hours of music on the playlist.. also Q has been disappearing.,0
Even though a few or a lot of people choose 1 star I believe that Spotify will become better and great I will still download this app even though people call it horrible don't judge quickly as I hope that the next update will be better 10/10,1
They removed the car view feature. This makes the app too dangerous to use while driving which makes it useless for what I want it for. Just so they can sell their over priced Carthing device. You'd think paying for premium would allow you to keep that feature but NOPE. So I'm not going to pay anymore if I can't get full use from the app.,0
First time I view 22 rating app ,1
Improve your add system,1
I have been very happy with this app over the years and pay for premium which has been awesome for working in areas without service and still keeping my music library accessible! I have noticed that the ability to change songs from my lock screen seems to have disappeared about 6 months ago and most recently the music has had steady glitches in playing where a 2 second gap of music has been occurring as when i leave the app occasianly the controls for the current song seem to be gone. S20FE,0
SPOTIFY I DON'T LIKE THE NEW UPDATE WHEN I PLAY SOME MUSIC I LIKE OTHER MUSIC WILL BE PLAYED LIKE- FIX IT RN,0
"It's a very nice app, specifically for music but there's only one catch that the ads are so annoying",0
"I can find any variety of music I like listening to. From oldies and modern to classical, movies and even a little Broadway .",1
"Really good musical app has approximately everything but does not have the oldest collections because my parents really like to listen the oldest list of songs the black and white time classics, if this was added in then this app can be fullfilled with everything.",1
This platforms been incredible up until a month ago when it started crashing almost every couple songs and buffering like a macintosh in a freezer.,0
Since I've upgraded to the paid subscription I'm REALLY enjoying Spotify. I used to only listen to YouTube bit they have way too many ads and commercials. I'm loving Spotify!,1
It's excellent app n I am enjoy has a music lover by getting all information,1
"They've purposely made free so infuriating. I get 30 mins no ads so while listening to a chill, relaxed playlist it randomly throws in some drill? Why!?",0
Please add the download feature so we can listen to the songs even when we are out of connection,0
Spotify admits that their app is no longer fit for Samsung devices but are in no hurry to refund premium users. What a disgrace. Fix your app.,0
"To Me this is the best music app ever, its easy great sound quality, there are many apps but Spotify tops them all.",1
All that I know too say is that the songs that I pick out is songs that I grew up with they bring back memories back when I was young,1
Great app...simple and easy to use. I like it.,1
"Honestly, Spotify is one of my favorite apps ever created. I love how easy it is to find new music. They are always coming out with new features that make it easier, like the enhanced playlist. Could use some sort of button where you click it and it pulls up all the remixes/covers of a song. That would be badass",1
"The app worked fine for a few months but afterwards it started showing no internet connection even though my network worked just fine on other platforms, I tried reinstalling the app but I couldn't login it kept showing something went wrong or network connection issue even though my net work was working just fine. Please fix this",0
Cannot play any song online. It just freezes and stops songs. It wasn't like this last week so i was wondering what happened. I tried reinstalling but it's still the same.,0
Great music streaming app but crashes multiple times a day make me sad,0
Very good buy the upgrade for motorcycle riding helps alot,1
The functionality of this App is dreadful. After a while it stope showing the selection being played and you cannot stop whatever it is your listening to? I have to delete App and reinstall. I pay for Spotify and all. FIX IT PLEASE,0
"Its an amazing app, I love it. I use it every day for listening to music. My only problem is I can't find a way to turn on videos for the songs that have them, it doesn't even give me the option to do so. I'd really like some help trying to figure that out but other than that its an amazing app.",1
Love this app this is so much efficient and we can also hear podcasts in this it is really amazing I love it,1
I've been a fan of Spotify for many years now & will continue to enjoy your service. Thank You So Much! ðŸ¤“ðŸ‘,1
Chindi aap,1
Advantages just that I can't repeat the song or pass the limit of changing songs whenever I want because I'm currently a learner which is I don't work and have money to pay the premium edition ðŸ˜ª,0
Very satisfied with music selection available on Spotify.,1
The best music selection and it's very easy to use,1
Best music app. Dont believe what others say try it then decide.,0
Latest update caused many problems. I am on an Android phone and the app is not working properly any more. Please fix the issue.,0
"It literally doesn't play the song you click on and just plays some other random song, it's stupid.",0
Wide exceptional myriad of songs. Pick your choices!@!,1
It's a good application I wish they provided an Mpesa option for other subscription plans,1
Is exciting app which provide many kind of music.,1
Pretty much has turned into the same handful of overplayed songs and ads.,0
Spotify was my go to music app and I loved it. But lately it seems to stop in the middle of songs or stop and skip to another song. I pay for Family premium and it's not cheap. Spotify needs to fix these problems.,0
I really like listening to podcast on Spotify,0
Great music selections in any genre.,1
It's kind of funny how every controversial joe rogan podcast I listen too pauses every 20 second for an advertisement that I've said a million times im not interested in but all the other episodes I can listen to all the way threw I've about had it,0
The folder organize is improper. If we select sid Sriram play list we are seeing another singer related songs. It is same for all the other Playlist,0
I love when Spotify crashes or randomly decides to forget how load any data.,0
I wouldn't say it was bad but everytime I searched my songs up and I pressed play it kept playing different songs not mine ðŸ˜,0
Since I started using Spotify I'm enjoying it. I had another similar music app and was doubtful about using Spotify and wasn't even really sure what this app entailed but I found out and downloaded it and enjoying thus far very much. It's great ðŸ‘ðŸ¼,1
Never had a problem with this app till this last update. There is no way to pause or to skip through the songs and I have the paid version. It also stops and plays every 5 seconds on it's own.,0
i use this app both on my phone and laptop but in phone it works perfectly fine but in laptop it's lagging too much and it's been weeks now and still it's lagging too much please fix this Spotify,0
I've tried other music apps .. I've always came back to using Spotify every time ...,0
Very nice to listen your songs,1
Ever ready music app at all time.,1
"4 stars for now, 5th one will be there when I can find the option to play songs from device which aren't available on Spotify. Otherwise, a good overall experience",1
Now is easy for me to hearthesongs I already download in my list of library album music,0
Their music library is amazing. All the songs you love is here!!!!,1
It is appalling you have to pay just to fast forward...,0
5 back to back ads legitimately ridiculous for free user 2 should be sufficient,0
"Bring back the ""enhance"" feature for the Liked Songs playlist. It's been the best way for me to discover new music that I actually like.",1
Why spotify is not working from last 2/3 days?,0
"great app, great quality, better than apple music",1
"Extremely buggy and consistently broken, even on newer phone (Galaxy S20). Frequently crashes, will stop playing for no reason, will say ""no connection"" when I have 5G 5 bars and all other apps are loading... highly considering canceling my premium membership given that the app can't even function in the most basic ways",0
I used to love this app but now that you can't see the songs in the playlist I just don't like it,0
"Stopped working with Android Auto :( there is nothing on the screen, cannot skip tracks.",1
"Spotify is the best, but the apps broken right now, play ack controls randomly disappear and the music keeps pausing, and external media control breaks, so pausing skipping songs and such become impossible",0
I love this app . I am using this more than 2 years sound quality is awsome,0
Yha humari zindagi m gum h aur tum add chala rhe ho  Plzz try to understand our feelings,1
"love it, I always rely on this for music. I also have the premium plan",1
Yes  is a,1
"The app is currently experiencing some kind of major bug. It stops playing randomly, crashes, and stops showing the ""playing"" bar so I can't stop the music without force closing the app.",0
"I'v only come across this app and I can't get over the tunes I'm in to, I'm an old man from the 60s I can find everything I have asked for,. â˜®ï¸ Peace and love to all â¤ï¸",0
Great music experience.,1
"This app is amazing on ipad buy on phone its terrible. I can't loop songs, when I click on my playlists it plays a random song, I am uncapable of playing the songs I wany and it's beyond ridiculous please fix this because this app is becoming terrible and frustrating to use.",0
"This is the worst streaming app on the market. It adds unwanted songs to playlists, doesn't allow the user to remove them, and then blocks the user from skipping the unwanted songs. YouTube ads are preferable to this nonsense.",0
"Some songs have some wrong lyrics, some don't have lyrics & some songs like ""deewani mastani"" & ""ang laga de""is having problem to be played & finally it is deleted from the app...Problems like these must be solved ASAP...Otherwise everything is good...",0
If you love and even NEED to have music on your phone then you NEED this app. Cannot say enough good things about these guys and their well designed app.,0
Update3 6/2/22 Disappointed with Spotify's inability to handle the Joe Rogan Podcast. Deleting episodes is unacceptable. I was considering buying premium to support the defence of Joe Rogan. But Spotify caved to the mob. Till the situation is rectified...1 star and no subscription.,0
It's amazing music platform I love it so much,1
I really love Spotify really great app. I've been using for several years now and it's still a very good for app downloading and sharing especially the free version..,1
Cryptic campfire is best podcast ever and anyone who thinks otherwise is mentally ill but I really wish there was a feature where you could restart a play list,0
"Very good, it also gives the information about where the music is being played and who is using ur account and listening to which song and if someone else is using it u can control it by ur device",1
I can listen to my favourite music whenever I choose! I love it.,1
Like the app but i would like to have the colorful play navigation bar under my notifications like my note 8 does. Not sure why they haven't implemented that feature for newer phones,0
IT SUCKS whenever I try to go out it stops,0
Good for music. Not a good platform for free speech,0
Amazing music app,1
"Basically all is good, BUT if someone call me and I disable headphones, when call is ended music is playing automatically. Please double-check it",1
its great,1
"Spotify seems to have a mind of it's own it will stop anytime it wants and it wants to stop so often it's no longer a joke, there are problemsthat need to be looked into especially at $12 per month. if I select an artist to listen to it will play other artists that it wants regardless of my choice and I have premium paying version. If this keeps happening then I'm going back to playing music I have. You are on notice if it stays the way it is then you are not getting a second payment from me",0
Adds make so much irritating,0
Great app. Recent update moved the play/pause button to the left side and I feel likes it's more difficult to use in app now,0
"I actually like this app, no complain but i really want spotify to do some changes regarding its lyrics feature. I really like song like punjabi, k-pop, and other languages song i wish i could convert these lyrics in english and could understand the lyrics in better...all i could do is search in Google for it's lyrics which is quite troublesome...",0
Samsung was sponsored by it . How can it would be bad ? Really feeling awesome with spotify . Free user but awesome experience with high quality music ðŸ˜,1
I use this app to listen to music all the time and I still will but I just sat here waiting to listen to music but instead I got 10 advertisements in a row. I don't think anybody should be having to listen/watch 10 advertisements.,0
"""shuffle"" mode just cycles through the same 15-30 songs on a playlist with over a thousand songs. Offline mode for listening without internet is cursed, have to restart the device every time. I'm cancelling my subscription next month",0
"Once you get premium, it's the best app ever. Until then, it's still okay (although the commercials are very annoying) for music and great for podcasts.",1
Great can use a little work,1
"This app is not used for Kannada people, only showing Telugu,Tamil & Hindi, please not install the kannada people",0
Great to listen to podcasts,1
App is a bit buggy after last update. Stops randomly and sometimes I can't see what's currently playing at the bottom of the screen. Also doesn't always sync well with desktop app,0
Have been a fan for many years and I am sure many more to come!! Thanks Spotify for being part of my life and that of my familyâ€™s too!,1
Only have this app for podcasts that I can't get anywhere else but I hate using it. The UI is horrible. Can't get it to play the way I want it to. Just the fact that they stonewall their Podcasters to not post publicly so they can be the exclusive place for them is bs and makes me angry. Their stance on spreading false news is also horrible. But I hated Spotify before that.,0
Hi Spotify I have an Issue .Actually i am unable to play some liked songs and we can't even search for some .For example a song Name After Dark x Sweater Weather i played it for 2-3 days and then it suddenly stopped to play and I can't find that song on Spotify plz help,0
"The new update has a problem, the app is crashing every time I try to search a song",0
Too many ads. I got about 15 ads in a row.,0
"a really great music app, but i occasionally get logged out and can't log back in with it saying that the app is in offline mode",1
Impossible to use liked songs will only play in shuffle controls are unbearable and the app is stuck on one song and will not let me play any others,0
Very much recommended  Good  8,1
It is really the best app for streaming songs online. Minor issue is there is no option to select a song as favourite in lock screen. Otherwise all good.,1
Please help me.. I can't get the app to work for longer than 3 min tops then it stops and I have to press play again.. its set to run in background. I actually unsubscribed 2 months ago due to this problem and I thought it would be sorted by now.,0
"The app works fantastic and as long as you keep sick enough for Joe Rogan, I'll keep listening to Spotify. Thank you. PS stop removing his episodes.",1
WTH! This app is glicthing so much.Please fix problem.,0
I love it.. I can listen to my favorite music all day long,1
"Have mostly enjoyed Spotify, The glitch with no 'currently playing' bar was disappointing, as it happened on 4 day weekend. kept having to restart my phone during a party. Not a good look for a host. Some music Not found on Spotify and had to look at other music platforms to find them Like ""It's a great day to be alive"" from Jah Vinci. Great song but not on Spotify.",0
Installed bit won't even open. Checked online it takes my credentials and credit card details but won't log me in in the app. Great.,0
"They asked me to rate the app, so I'm rating the app. They chose a helluva time to make this push.",0
Users on the free plan of Spotify can only shuffle albums and playlists. Which means I can't search for a specific song to play when searching without shuffling with unrelated songs or a certain song in a playlist. I'll stick to desktop Spotify.,0
The app is great when it's not freezing or infinitely loading. I have to force close it regularly.,1
"Pay for premium but the app is really buggy recently, have to log I'm and out, uninstall and reinstall, can't play podcasts....",0
"Somethings wrong...if I'm not using my phone, the music stops playing. I have to restart my phone to get it to stop playing after it disconnects from the Bluetooth. Everything was perfect before this.",0
"truly a great app. it'd be really cool if you could make different groups for different kinds of playlists!! like studying, cleaning etc :)",1
"2022 0503. 88mb size app, better to use lite versions",0
"This new update is terrible on phone! I can't choose what songs to play! All it does is shuffle play which deletes the whole purpose of organizing a Playlist! And whenever I want to play 1 song, it plays other songs along with it that's not even from the same artist! Very disappointing.",0
Many songs of different languages are available... But the number of ads keep on increasing in small intervals if you don't have premium. And it's just so irritating.,0
I've used Spotify since 2008 and have always loved it. But lately I don't know what's happening with the option to skip/pause a song. I don't even seem to have buttons for this and if I want music to stop playing I have to force the app to stop. If I want to skip a song I have to search for a different one? I've always paid for premium but unless this is fixed I'll look elsewhere. I use it everyday so it's super important it works well.,1
"Too many ads... If someone doesn't want to take the premium subscription, then it's not justified to ruin their music experience by running too many ads.... Pathetic ðŸ¤®",0
"Recent update is buggy, music stops playing and the play button disappears.",0
"For a while they removed the feature to preview songs before you add them to a playlist, but they added it back, so I'm giving 4 stars because it's a really good app to use (as long as you have premium), but I don't like how the features that are the reason I pay for Spotify can just be taken a way on a whim for months.",0
"Sound quality is horrible compared with competitors, i would expect at least cd 96khz 24bitrate audio quality wich they claim to have but compared with qobuz there's a clear difference in quality.",1
"bug; when opening the app and playing music it will begin to play without a play bar, have to close the app and reopen to get it to function properly please fix edit: its doing this again pls make it stop",0
This is a really good app to listen to music and podcasts on and I really suggest it for everyone! Though the ads are a little bit annoying if you don't pay for it.,1
"Most of the songs that I try to find, I could find them",0
We cannot download songs without being in premium membership,0
Like the discover weekly playlist More of this please,1
Please bring back the preview option. Also too many ads,0
I'm not able to play any song..app is crashing whenever I click on play,0
Greatest app in the world ðŸ‘ðŸ’œðŸ¤©ðŸ˜ðŸ˜˜ . I feel so good and refreshed after listening to the music and they have so audio quality so refreshing ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ,1
"I've had an amazing experience with Spotify, especially with buying Premium and removing ads. A great app, highly recommended.",1
"They're right fix your update spotify, I was searching the songs I like then I can't find it only showed up playlist. Im now listening to youtube, please fix this update. No Offence ha. I was having fun listening to spotify before.",0
For like 2 months i got no ads i thought it was a bug because baldies at spotify want money more than customer service but I'm still grateful!,1
The only thing I don't like is I can't pick the song I want to play and I can't change from shuffle play to just playing from the first song to the last,0
"one thing, please make it so that you always get asked if you really want to remove a song from your liked songs bc there has been so many occasions where i accidentally clicked on the heart and it messed up my order and its annoying!!!!!!! also would be cool if you get the ""what are my friends listening to?"" on mobile.",0
Forces large downloads without clarifying what is being downloaded and constantly glitches itself off when I'm doing something where I can't constantly futz with my phone,0
"Bought a new phone, but having trouble accessing my account to recover my play lists, Spotify assistance minimal,which is a pity i love the app, after 12 years may opt out of the service",0
"1. I see irrelevant playlists about Bhangra, Tollywood, etc. despite having English as my only preferred language. 2. I see irrelevant podcasts on my homepage in Hindi despite, again, my language preferences. The language preference setting just feels like an illusion of choice. Overall, not an experience I expect from a ""premium"" service.",0
"Really hoped that I could use the algorithms Spotify has to find music that I would like based on what I already listen to. Unfortunately they aren't that good, especially not for someone who likes a variety of music.",0
I play a song that i want and it plays something else i disabled autoplay same thing i also cant even play 1 song no playlists or nothing im gojng back to youtube smh ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸.,0
I'm pretty disappointed lyrics aren't showing up for me even though I pay a premium plan. It's the most recent version on an S22+ too. 8.7.22.1125 Please help me fix this.,0
"I actually use Spotify lite at first, then i try this but uhh too much ads like everytime I listened to one song then boom, three ads right after that. So I don't really have a nice experience using this. So, for me, if you really JUST want to listen to music/song (like only for study or chilling), use the lite version instead.",0
"If I want to unsubscribe from premium... Why do I have to open my account in web browser? App must have that functionality, that saves time and effort, improves customer experience in a few words...",0
The worst music app I have used till date after every song you have to listen to an ad that is of 30 seconds and if you want to switch to another playlist then also you have to watch a 30 second sad literally the ads made me mad and I was forced to uninstall this app. I will recommend everyone to download MX player because it is of multiple purpose use it provide shoe listening to songs without any ads or you have to listen to its very and those are just of 10 seconds or 5 seconds. I hate spoti,0
Garbage. Cant even play the podcasts I have downloaded without internet connection. What the f is the point then.,0
Great app and I love it but recently I've noticed that songs seem to buffer or just stop playing randomly. This happens even if I am playing a downloaded song and after reading reviews it seems I'm not the only one with this issue.,0
There is way to much ads on mobile also i dont like that we cant listen to out like songs,0
The features are cool beans.,1
Smooth experience only challenge is not able to identify original or remix,0
"Too much advertisements, it's says 30 mins ad free but within 15mins next ad comes.",0
"ok the app was really good when I first used it, but after the update it became literally like trash. like for example. I couldn't play the song I wanted to, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling back but it wouldn't work. Please fix this so I can put the rating into 5, I would appreciate it.",0
Love the premium for 3 months @ $10.00,1
"There needs to be an easier way to close this app besides a forced stop through my settings on phone. IHeart is starting to look like a better option in functionality. I can't even shut off or restart phone without this app trying to run, when I don't want to currently have it open",0
I am able hear some of the best song ever this is why I gave Spotify 5 stars,1
"I think there is no use of playlists that we make coz the other songs which i don't have in my Playlist plays next.... There are lots and lots ads... OMG.... ðŸ˜³ Few days after downloading the app it was working well but later on it became worst.... Idk y the song stops in between and suddenly starts playing other songs which aren't there in my Playlist tooo, i want Spotify to improve in terms of that songs getting stopped in the middle. Please do look upon these matters. A very frustrating appðŸ˜ª",0
"Since mid May 2022, I can't play anything on Spotify. All of my playlists are either empty or have like 2 songs on them. Even official Spotify playlists are empty. Edited: There's been 4 updates since this post and I still can't listen to any music. I pay for this and I can't use it. The website works but I can't download a playlist there so I have to use my mobile data. I'll be switching to Pandora, I guess. I prefer Spotify but I can't use it! ðŸ˜¡",0
"App is having serious glitches lately. It has been playing out of my phone without prompting, continuing to play after disconnecting from Bluetooth, and will play without showing media controls on my lock screen or in my notifications. Sometimes even in the app the media controls on the bottom of the screen won't be present, but it will be playing content. Very frustrating to use over the last week+",0
Thing i hate in old spotify im premium but my storage is full and i delete then i uninstall apps and i down load now but i can't restore purchase please fix it,0
Poor service and security. Song on playlist and account can be hacked easily.,0
Takes forever to load idky. And when it does load it shows that there is no network connection while every other app works fine,0
"Okay I am done with this app , just too many ads , 30 minute ad less playback is a scam , i am getting 1.5 to 3 min ads every track i listen to , just don't tell me to buy premium , this app and Ads are completely annoying. Makes you feel bad and miserable for not having premium",0
"Why the hell there is a hidden option ,in search it is not showing the song if it is hidden",0
This is my favorite music share platform~ The interface is easy to use and easy to learn. I highly recommend.:),1
Love this app I can listen to all the music,1
Even though you have to have premium to pick a song it's pretty good,1
"Everything in this app is good in fact I love it but the one thing that make me hate it is ads Really, I know that ads can't be removed but it can be of less seconds and shown less so that we can enjoy the song . But the ads appear quickly one after other and they are of very seconds I mean really please please resuce the time of appearing an ad and also its seconds. Please it will be really helpful if you will make it . Thank You",0
"Lately for Android, the music continues to just stop several times. I have deleted, re-installed, updated many time and it's good for a few days and then starts again. This s happening on my other Android devices as well.",0
Thank God not too many ads spoiling the good mood n music.Thank you .,1
I have liked it a lot and i have dicided to give it 5 star. I was awsome and i really want to say a thank to the creator of this app Spotify,1
It has most of the discographies from artists I listen to buy not all. I'd be ok with a few singles missing here and there but not full albums.,0
Best music streaming app,1
To many adds and if that couls add the downlode feture for free that would be cool,0
The cerator of this app you need fix all the bugs with your app,0
It's much better than ganna app. J m really enjoying it,1
45 stars  overall,1
"Want to give 5 stars BUT: every time I play a podcast or song it gets stuck on that title when I try to switch to a new song or podcast. I have to Uninstall and reinstall to fix it (this is about the 40+ time I've had to do so). PLEASE FIX THIS, I'm on an S21 Ultra 5g so it's definitely your app and not my phone. Edit: It's been MONTHS of this same issue I see other people are having also. Please fix so I don't have to Uninstall and reinstall every other day, (premium member btw)!",0
It's actually the best music app ever I am personally addicted to it its just it contains every songs yeah some are not there but it's OK cuz most of the songs are available but the reason I gave 4 stars is some times it doesn't work properly so I have to re install it many times .... but else than that everything is perfect ðŸ–’,1
"Useless! Never used to be this bad! Stops playing in the middle of podcasts and I have to unlock phone, go into the app to get it to start playing again and won't play unless the app is left open. How is this with Â£10 a month. Will be cancelling subscription!",0
"Everything is way good, but make a comment section for every song, so that people can write their thoughts on their favourite songs. In this way the music artists will also come to know, how listeners feel about their creations. -Thankyou :)",1
Tell me one thing is that how we use or download songs in Spotify other wise this app is very amazing no words ......... great job team of Spotify,1
Really a superb app but i give only 3 stars because there are one advertisement at a single song.so kindly avoid it,0
App keeps crashing or just stops playing. Another issue has started play and pause randomly disappear. I like Spotify but the app has far to many bugs. I expect a much better app,0
"I constantly have to update the app because whatever I'm listening to will randomly stop playing. There seems to be an update for the app every single time this happens, as if my Spotify app is reverting to prior to my updates",0
"IF you're paying for premium, you would be upset just like me. Go to play a song, screen goes off naturally (not clicking lock screen button) and at 1.49 EXACTLY, song shuts off. I know about the ""Saver"" but it's literally not working, still shuts off at 1:49 into the song. Please fix this by next month or I will no longer be subscribed to your premium.",0
"Disaster app. Bugs, crashes, lags. For a paid subscription, totally awful. Each new update brings new failures. At least you don't fail to deliver constant failures. Good job.",0
My Spotify Won't open and i don't know why. Kindly fix it. It's always force closing,0
I love the app and the music. Only thing is I have a paid subscription. All my downloads want to show up but most of the songs says they are not downloaded. It has me going back and forth on wifi. It is pretty anoying.,0
Excellent selection Beautiful songs bring the down memories.,1
It's really enjoyable using this app and am learning new latest hit each day.,1
"My go to app for all my music needs. Huge selection, easy to navigate and The Joe Rogan show is great ðŸ‘",1
I am playing a podcast and it plays random songs when I skip... Unable to listen to on demand songs. It keeps forcing to pay for basic features...,0
Really good app. I would be grateful to have a possibility to listen podcast in loop,1
I like music and Spotify has the music,1
"It was amazing a few weeks in, (unpaid) when I could play any song I wanted. A few later, still unpaid, I had no control. It shuffles my playlists, and I would've liked that since all my songs are good. It was an immediate uninstall when random 'recommended' songs appeared. Shuffling into a song I've never heard is unacceptable.",0
Very good app!!! I love this!!,1
"Spotify says the whole time that I can't play a song 'cause I have no internet. I downloaded my songs, so I could listen to them offline. Somehow it doesn't work and I can't listen to them when I'm at a place with no Wifi. Please fix this Spotify. It's really annoying.",0
the best aap ever for music but the prblm is add... but the aap is sooooooooo goodâ£ï¸ðŸ––,1
"It's ok, but it wont allow me to play my downloaded playlist while offline, and that's annoying.",0
60 second ad every 3 minute song.,0
Almost every song you want to hear is on this app. The ads can get a bit annoying but otherwise an incredible music and podcast streaming app,1
Screw this app i mean its cool but when I go to my liked song and hit shuffle play then it picks a random music from home and turns it on and also i can only skip musics 6 times an hour please fix this spotify,0
Good but little bit laag in song switch,0
"Years after years waiting for the feature that displays song's lyrics ... As a premium user for years, I had enough but ... at last It's present. Now we can see lyrics of the song. Raising from one to 4 stars. Now ... An interesting feature would be like a vote system that help fans to tell artist a specific song one wants to be present in Spotify. If the quorum is good enough, it would be a win to win situation to put the song in artist playlist.",1
"I use the app almost all the time and love it but it closes with no reason when I open certain apps. It just turns itself off and closes with no apparent reason as to why. There is also a problem with the now playing bar, sometimes it won't appear and there is no indication that the music is playing except for being able to hear the song which, because you can't see the now playing bar, you can't pause.",0
Great selection and new fun features,1
App keeps getting stuck and I constantly have to restart it,0
Love the App Easy to use,1
"Was really enjoying Spotify until the App started crashing. Even tried re-installing, but it didn't fix the issue. Unfortunately I'm going to cancel my subscription and stick with Apple Music. What a shame. ðŸ™",0
Good music always there always kind of music you want,1
Top notch Features with Clean UI. Just Amazing ðŸ¤©,1
Nice app but I'm not able to buy the premium with my card is there any method?,0
"When i use my smartwatch to control spotify, the app either becomes very jumpy (playing is jumpy,or stop playing altogether) or the simply quitted from my phone. Even when music continues to play, the app interface does not display properly on my phone at (even within the app, it doesnt display the currently-playing status). It has been going on for a while and no fixing so far. Now I simply wont use spotify on my smartwatch! Please fix it or I am forced to switch music provider. Thanks.",0
"Yeah, the app isn't showing the songs playing anymore...",0
I have Spotify Premium & love that I can download all the music I want & can access it even w/o wifi,1
Great app its better with premium which I have but overall really good app,1
Awesome app i love it and i have never experienced any problems with it here in ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¼,1
Good sound quality,1
Nice app for songs there are millions of songs,1
"Very great quality, only backfire is that every now and then when I go to get back on, and old song will be in play mode and stay on pause so I can't skip or fix it without deleting and redownloading the app. Overall five stars though.",1
It's stopped working. Spotify has been great but recently it's not been playing my podcasts but my songs are perfectly fine.,1
Love Spotify! Have had it for years!,1
"Please fix this app. I cannot access my Playlist, when I search my results don't show up, I can't access notifications. Been like this for a month. I uninstall then reinstall the app and nothing. If I log into Spotify on my web browser I have all functions, but nothing works on the app.",0
"Great app for listening to music ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜˜it has good music. Every song u need!ðŸ˜ And also,...no annoying ads",1
Play/Pause bar missing. Songs will stop playing by themselves. Have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times in 3 days. Fixes the problem for a few hours then the glitches start again,0
Love using Spotify for whatever I like to listen to. Everything about it is AMAZING!! NO faults.,1
"This app is great, I have a premium account but my discovery weekly have been the same for several months now... It never updates :/",0
Welcome to all the new censorship platform. It used to be good and full of interesting podcasts. Now it's removed healthy debates. Here's the point we're it went downhill.,0
More ads than options. Keeps clinching so my podcasts close after a few minutes of playing,0
I can't switch genres in my Liked Songs list anymore.,0
"Love it, its great and so much great music!",1
"I use it almost every waking hour. I've discovered music I never would have otherwise. I have binged artists I adore. I have listened to and been entertained, enlightened and educated by a wealth of podcasts available. My long commutes are no longer such a chore and I'm able to keep the wide vary of tastes at work happy with the wide variety of music I play. 5 stars couldn't be happier.",1
You're studying more about what I listen You're genius making daily mix everyday :),1
"good app for listening to music, but the ads are insane. it'll say ""30 min ad free music"" then play an ad 2 songs later",0
Nice app...but if u doesn't take premium membership....there are lots of ads,0
Cool app but some songs are no loaded,0
I used the free version before deciding on going premium and it's the best decision I could've done. Now I've been on premium for 6 or 7 years now !! Would definitely recommend going premium if you can ðŸ«¶ðŸ½,1
"i accidentally pressed log out and now It's stuck at the logo screen. I've uninstalled and intalled it numerous times, cleared the data and cache and yet i still can't totally access the app. please fix this i can't lose my playlists there :(",0
"Shared link of the Spotify is not getting opened for play....the Spotify opens but the song doesn't gets open, it shows the previous played song",0
give back the feature where you can listen to the preview of the songs before you add them to your playlist plsðŸ˜ž,0
Too bad to many ads,0
"Spotify is the best app to listen music, it's sound quality, consuming less amount of data etc, the problem i have is with some (Indian) ads that is indirectly offensive like looking down on poor people who couldn't afford premium membership.",0
Keeps playing stuff other than the play list I created,0
"As a Niel Young fan, you've just lost my monthly subscription. Whoever made this decision rightfully owes Spotify my monthly subscription fee, I've now maintained for 5 years from here on, because they took money out of your pocket. The same as stealing from your register. You guys already had a very limited music selection and I found myself often using YouTube. Well I guess I'll just pay them for everything instead you dope heads lol",0
"Since the latest update, the user experience is far away from being optimal. Music or podcasts stop all of a sudden. I cannot find the stop/play button because it disappears from time to time and I have no idea why. I am a paying customer and unfortunately thinking about canceling my subscription if there is no improvement anytime soon. I am running the app version 8.7 22.1125 on my Android 12 phone. I deinstalled and reinstalled the app, and I restarted my phone several times, but no change.",0
the app is just beautiful and alright.,1
So I was listening to my Spotify playlist and I have it in a certain order so that it isn't jumbled. I was listening to a song in my playlist and then it skipped two songs in my playlist and played another song which I knew wasn't next. I check my playlist and tried putting the skipped songs on but it only letter me listen to previews of the songs in my playlist. I don't know why it's doing this and it's frustrating! The whole reason why I made my playlist is so songs aren't everwhere :/,0
Needs to be just the song or Playlist that is chosen to be played by the listener and needs to have no premium and should be add free,0
"Horrible experience, just after updating the app I can't play a single song. None of them can be heard. Sometimes the app itself doesn't open. Very disappointing ðŸ˜ž.",0
"Bad at sticking to a soundtrack, keeps splicing other music in or just going off on tangents. Interface is to simplified, can't tell if I've got a setting wrong, but it should be the most straightforward thing to play the songs contained within a single soundtrack so there shouldn't be room for user error here.",0
"This App is good but after using the PC version for a few days, it is so much better, it's like you actually have the freedom to choose which songs you want to play unlike here on mobile! PC: 10/10! Mobile: 4/10",1
"It is a great app. I really love it, but I usually struggle to get my family members on my Family Plan",0
"Great music app, I just wish I could remove tracks from the combined playlist feature.",1
Way more music than you could listen to. They have plenty of obscure stuff I can't find elsewhere. I have been premium for 4 years straight. They started givingHulu for free which saved me 10 bucks a month. They even sent me a free Google home mini.,0
Amazing,1
I give five star because I used premium service. Please Hi-Fi or MQA version!!!,0
Very good,1
What a world of diffrence between free and premium .... Definetly upgradexto premium now,0
"This app is okay for the basics but it is missing some key features that the web download version has which makes it 10x better, being able to listen to songs without queuing etc, being fully able to edit your playlists and being able to see friends listening activity as well, these simple things would improve this app so much as right now it isnt the best and i've been a premium user for years :(",0
Add skips and play song automatic,0
It's alright yeah. Only problem is even with premium you cannot download a song you'd have to make it a favourite or get the whole album even tho you just want one song Why not bring the option to download one song if that's your desire. Work on that acting like you're deezer out here. I used apple music before I came on and this will honestly make me go back. So irritating.,0
Uninstalled it as it does not work on my device. Waste of time!,0
"This app sucks, I've been using it for years and had no problem but when i create a playlist it puts random songs on it that i don't like and i can't listen to any songs that i like bc it keeps playing other song that i did not even know existed, if i could rate it a zero i would but i can't so i give it a one",0
To much ads.. when you play any song after the song the ads will show you evry time.. I think the cheapest app of listen the song...ðŸ˜¡,0
"This App sucks so hard. Disconnects during every episode, takes over 20 minutes to reconnect, pain-in-the-*ss to skip adds/forward, AND I GOT HACKED like I have never been hacked before",0
Can't go wrong with Spotify,1
this app is really good it dosent have too manyh adds and all its just the 6 skips can be anoying but its not a problem on computers or tablets,1
"What's happened?! Used to be a brilliant app, but the last couple of weeks very glitchy. Don't get the overlay of the song/podcast being played, so no way to stop or pause without force closing. And it just keeps randomly stopping",0
It is very nice app I loved this app in YouTube i can't find the song but in this app when i type the song it's there.,1
Unusable due to play bar disappearing. Buggy mess since latest update. Further incomprehensible UI changes. Spotify is really going down-hill.,0
"new update causing issues. playback bar at bottom disappears, playback audio drops constantly",0
Just gets worse Had premium for years now and for the last 12 months it has randomly paused and crashed every 4 or 5 songs and I'm sick of it. Will be using something else unless they fix it in the next few weeks.,0
"Love the service! Just wish they had lyric videos with the canvases. Still, 5 stars!!ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¼ But, my canvas are gone! It's not an option on my settings and I own a Galaxy S21 ultra. Why Spotify, why?!?! This is the second time!!!",0
Shows inappropriate podcasts that I've never listen to and I can't get rid of them.,0
U can't even listen to the music you want it just plays suggested music,0
They are really good I think and they support their artists old and new and upcoming and I love dj mode,1
"I have an issue that makes the app very problematic. On all restarts, i have to download all the downloaded content and move to ""SD Card"" again. How can i solve this problem?",0
"App stuck on load screen, even after multiple uninstalls.",0
After update not working why?,0
If the monthly subscription are lower so much better.,0
"I absolutely love this app, it's the best free music app I've had! It's even got the Undertale and omori soundtracks. However, my music keeps shuffling, and I don't know how to stop it from shuffling. Ik that green play button on my playlists has the shuffle button on it, and I'm not sure what that means lmao. So, if someone could help me out with that, that'd be cool.",0
Very good ...but... there are better music apps which I won't mention....I've decided to stay with Spotify anyway because it's getting better and better and caters well for offline listening. I advise Spotify to everyone I know and would also advise others to stick with Spotify because the more users the better it becomes. Simple. Rock on!!,1
A wide variety of songs and genres to choose from. Top tier app,1
Hey devs you seem to have forgotten the now playing button from my phone! Fix it!,0
"Liked it for a while, but the fact that they were given the choice between stopping covid disinformation or spreading it and they chose the latter is unforgivable. Moving to another app. Disgraceful.",0
Let's me listen to songs I like and songs that are new to me,1
Words allowed on this app do not express the annoyance of this app. Will be unsubscribing after years of service. Downloaded music was no reachable when service was lost or poor. Useless company and app.,0
"I am just in love with this app, all the functionalities added in this are really so thoughtful and impressive specially all the sorting of the songs and can listen with your friends also on which device the song playing and quality of music, collection everything is just awesome.Kudos to the app team!!",1
This app is very good but once awhile the music is buggy and my Spotify stops working,0
Bluetooth constantly cuts out with this app now. I've gone through every possible bit of troubleshooting. This is the app that does this. Fix it.,0
The app has been great however recently when l search a song it plays a totally different song from the one l choose.,1
goodjob spotify ,1
"When I search up a song right and I click on it, it doesn't even play on the right song",0
Music controls not showing up anymore. And songs are stopping part way through. Makes the app unusable,0
"So buggy it's unuseable. Most of the time you cannot pause or change music and have to keep restarting the app... They should pay people to use their garbage app, it's not even worth it if it was free.",0
Super songs,1
I just love finding all my favorite songs!,1
I am using all the music app like gaana wynk but Spotify is very nice app,1
Esta app es la mejor se encuenta la musica que quieres es buena hasta la tengo en mi computadora,1
Great app for high quality music. ðŸ‘Œ,1
I'm having problem with purchasing. It can't be done via voucher. Fix it.,0
This is a good app compared to YouTube music,1
Glitchy. Have to keep restarting it. Suddenly stops playing. I think the glitch is triggered when the on screen ads pop up.,0
Very nice and reliable source of playing music,1
It's an excellent app just that you cant play the previous song that's my only grievance,1
2 stars due to lagging play a song allgood 2nd song comes on plays for about 20sec then cuts off everytime. Iv uninstalled and reinstalled to see if it fix the problem and nothing still the same and I'm a premium customer this use to be one of the best apps.. what's going on Spotify paid customer to get ripped off not cool. If not fixed uninstalling for good take my $$ somewhere else.,1
The songs that I play on this app are the only things that I like. IM getting tired of these suggested songs that I just don't want to listen too if my playlist is over then play it again I don't wanna hear nothing else other than my playlist.,0
"It was great at first, I used to love it. But now ðŸš® I might as well delete it. And download deezer instead",0
Every time I open this app it takes over 10 minutes to show me online. it's getting worse,0
"I like the app when it works, but it constantly disallows me to use the playback controls. Requires a restart of the app often.",0
The app I didn't know I needed. Revolutionised music and podcasts.,0
The new update is still a bit buggy and the design is horrible,0
This review is edited i have been having issues that are really irritating whenever i am in another app or playing a mobile game my music will randomly stop and i have to go back into the app and play it sometimes it replays all over again the whole entire song i do not know what to do i need help and it is driving me nuts.,0
"Decent price , could use more audio books though (personally)",0
Easy way to find my music and podcast for a great price and best sound!,1
I love this app so much thankyou to spotify,1
Can't even listen to one song I like in my playlist it keeps putting suggested songs that I don't even like and I can't turn or take it off I just Wanna listen to my play list,0
Love love having all genres of music and endless play lists at hand!,1
Brilliant! Very pleased with the ability to listen to all gender of music and arrange it into play lists for playback.,1
"Payed for years for the app and was fine with it except a few bugs, but since a few weeks it is unusable...",0
"Experience has gone so downhill that even when I download a playlist, podcast, or whatever else it consistently cuts out or stops. Keeps getting worse.",0
great selections and also the suggestions they make based on my listening history is spot on,1
Everything I need ..... The Ads are annoying tho,0
It's fantastic to listen to what music you like ðŸ‘,1
I don't really like the update it gives me hard time just to listen to one music,0
"Good. Just wish for some feature stability. For example, sliding to the right to add to queue, doesn't work in the Liked Songs listing or in the search results listing. Also, when searching for sth, it'd be great to have the liked and saved stuff show up first. But that's complaining on a very sensitive level. Great app overall",1
You need to remove the heart from the widget when the player is accessible in the lock screen. I just decimated part of my playlist by accident because I thought I was hitting backwards instead of removing songs.,0
"I would rate higher, but play back is awful. It's like playing a skipped CD and this is across many different devices. Compleatly ruining the listening experience.",0
"Damn Spotify ones It's been alot now, I want atleast less ads between the songs, I'm just. Alot disturbed whole ad comes, and even I as comes like after 30min that would be so faar okay but y'all keep it like after 2 songs just 2 and I'm distracted as hell please i beg you to lessen the ads asap and this is the world's best app to play songs online of offline for those who have taken the premium membership I again say that please, please lessen the ads!!!!",1
Bahut achha app h,1
"The mobile app just fails to track the song I'm listening :( So, no menu I can use, nothing in notification area as well. Please fix!",0
At the first it was good but now after the updates i had to listen 6 ads in a row before I play a song I understand it is all business tactics but its at its peak. More over each ad is about 30 to 40sec we can't even skip. Kindly reduce ads,0
Its got everything from meditation to music that rocks !,1
Why i rate it a 1 IT WONT LET ME CHANGE THE DAM SONG ALL I WANTED TO HEAR WAS GANGSTA PARADISE BUT NO INSTED SOMETHING RANDOM LIKE WHAT EXCUSE ME,0
Was paying for premium they increased the price From 5 stars to 1 star You really know how to be a good app,1
"Its the best songs app but, without internet its nkt availalable if u have'nt subscribed",0
"Adds Are Very Disturbing & Sound Quality Isn't That Great.. Also Cannot find many Favourite songs, Or They Are Visible But Can't Be Played..",0
I enjoy spotify when I have to take a huge lunge of disasterous tenacity at my commitment to societal pressures.,0
Use Spotify for best music when your all data used Spotify helps to listen your favourite music in some kb.s easily Spotify really gives best service to their family means to all users thank you Spotify .,1
"Spotify is Going to get rid of Rogan and Bongino, only reason I have it and use it.",0
Awesome site easy to use,1
"I can't even pause my music and now playing disappeared. Googled for 30 minutes, what the heck Spotify - I can't even use your app now!",0
Amazing,1
I have enjoyed everything Spotify offers!,1
"Why is it so hard to redeem codes? I don't see a straightforward location to redeem my codes. Instead, you guys keep offering me premium. I want premium, but your site keeps giving me error that I bought a code at nearest convenience store. And what I found is that I can't find anything like that. Please give us a place to redeem our code, spotify. I don't want to subscribe. I just want to have one time purchase for now.",0
Very very good and ni ads this is best app,1
"Better than other music platforms but please stop adding stuff to my playlists. if I wanted it in the Playlist I would ask, don't add without my permission then refuse to let me skip the song. I dont wanna be forced to listen to these horrible songs",0
"Super glitchy on my S22, doesn't register that it's playing music so I cannot pause, skip, or play back songs.",0
So many complaints about albums not playing in order on Android auto for 3 years and still no fix. So frustrating Spotify fix this.,0
"Everything is fine, but when is swipe right to queue song coming to android?",0
I have no issues I love there are hardly any ads love Spotify,0
Its n good music app if you want to chill or party rn even just wanna list to music i recommend you use it,1
"Spotify, IMO while better than the alternative, is quickly going downhill. There's significant uptick in forced marketing that you can't opt out of in the paid subscription, constant push of 2nd and 3rd rate obscure artists, and what feels like bloat content constantly being shoveled through your dashboard just to give the impression of fresh content. As a paid subscriber, you have no ability with which to stop the nonsense.",0
Good,1
Awesome choice of music and podcasts,1
Best music app I ever had defenetly recommend ðŸ˜Š,1
"Spotify is Soo cool but i want to ask something to the developers, don't update the app too much cuz sometimes it stops working after an update...then u have to wait for the next update to come and then it will work but sometimes it still doesn't work so u have to wait more... overall Spotify is a good app...BTSðŸ’œARMY",1
Love this App its clear cut easy to use and I love the fact you have amazing people who upload podcasts that are giving balance and information to people. I joined to listen to Joe Rogan who is a master in his field of journalism in my view. The app is brilliant and the content is fast becoming my favourite.,1
Been using a while. No complaints at all for music but would prefer better effort for breakdown of podcasts. Find they have podcasts I would like but hard to find.,0
"This app is very good, because before it I was used to download music, but now I listen it free from this Spotify app, and this app doesn't use so much internet that is also a +point, thanks to app producers.ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œ",1
"It's nice but have more albums, especially Hip Hop, under new releases please",1
The search taking time and keep having to go back numerous times to restart search again. Missed the whole premium part it seems.,0
Spotify is the perfect app to listen to music and podcast with many playlist to choose from 10/10,1
"Nice app to listen music, works ok. Sometimes my downloaded Playlist doesn't work for me.",1
love spotify. but when I close all my tabs after a few seconds spotify keeps playing. and the only way to get it to stop is to delete the app. and redownload. please fix this.,0
Wonderful music and great variety,1
"I like your 30 mins uninterrupted, but its hard to enjoy when you software runs with the processing power of a 2 year old with down syndrome! Take a lesson from YouTube and actually play what people search for!",0
I like spotify and would reccomend it to anyone that wants a wide variety of music to choose from. If you can afford premium i highly reccomend it but if you can the base version is also really nice,1
Changed my comment since last time since more info came to light. However! You're the biggest music app on the planet. The bugs are starting to get annoying. Controlling another device shows a completely different song playing as example,0
I love this app. It literally finds exactly what you're lookin for!,1
"Great overall experience. Been using the app for years now and I have never had problems with anything regarding the app. I do wish I could add music files to playlists from my phone, but outside of that you get exactly what you pay for. Sometimes even more.",1
Pathetic always on notification always play songs without permission Worst app on earth,0
Excellent listening experience. You can listen to music with the screen off.,1
This app does not work for Ethiopians! It is says the app is not available in your country ðŸ˜žðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
"Never take their offer. They wont stop charging you! Its because anyone on your network can click on premium and your paying. No way to stop this, have to delete Spotify and never use it again. Only option. You will have to cancel your bank card. They will ask for pictures of your bank account to prove it. Dont trust these criminals at all with your bank info.",0
I love spotify!!!!!!!! I love music!!!!! This is the best music app. I feel bad for people with apple play.,1
Why you gotta play adds before the song even ends bruh,0
Love Spotify it's been the best since day 1!!,1
Pretty good app. You can add just about as many songs to a Playlist as you please. But after a certain point it stops telling you how many hours are in the Playlist. Also with one of the newer updates it won't let you look at songs to add to a Playlist you have to search each one individually. I think it would also be nice if we could add whole albums to a playlist,0
"Longtime subscriber first-time complainer. I know they have other $100MM+ problems, but I pay for a service that now includes at least 3+ random pauses per song. I did not subscribe for the musical chairs feature and will move to an app that focuses on music if not corrected in short order.",0
With recent updates I am unable to see what song is playing and the music continues playing as well.,1
"I'm a premium subscriber but I find the user interface rather clunky. I also don't like the occasional pop-up at launch asking me to upgrade...you have my email address for that Spotify! They've recently changed the in-car feature which has now rendered it useless in my car, as it now only caters for something called ""car thing"". The shuffle feature randomly kicks in with no instruction from the user. I'm paying for a service and don't feel like it's being provided.",0
I would love it more but I have a Playlist and when I play my Playlist random songs come on that Spotify says recommended song even tho I don't like them like that's why they are not in my Playlist and my friend has the premium and she says that doesn't happen to her but when it happens to me it doesn't make me want to get the premium to stop putting random songs in it makes me want to delete the app and download another music playing app like pandora or something.,0
So many poor UX choices and burying menu options people want way way way down in your settings.,0
"I can't use steering remote in my Kenwood Ddx718wbt version, Spotify won't displayed on screen. Please fix it.",0
The amount of ads on this app is terrible. At first it used to be one ad but now I get 5 in a row. Not to mention I barely 30 minutes of ad free music anymore which only adds insult to injury. I would give it zero stars but that's not possible so I give it a one.,0
"Any blue tooth device when commected will cause spotify to automatically open and play the most recent song you played last. No way to prevent the auto play. Needs to a addressed in the next update or you will loose subscribers. Upon doing research this is a known problem since 2015. Not sure why developers haven't fix this major issue. Only ""fix"" is to log out and log back in every time.",0
Best app for songs of every artist lover,1
"It's missing the controls for the music now. I cant pause it, skip anything. I have to turn off the app just to get it to stop",0
"Best option for music. Everything you can think of is on Spotify. They give you recommendations, make mixes and give concert info.",1
Almost no problems unlike YouTube music,1
"What have you DONE? This latest iteration of the app simply doesn't work. Constant crashes, cuts out, buttons not working, shuts off when the screen locks, I now have to use Amazon music on my phone.",0
This is a osm aap i used yet u can listen n learn songs from this bt there is one issue in this aap that some songs are not in this aap plz recover this prblm as soon as possible. Bt i love this aap very much,0
"It's an amazing app to listen to songs and record it, there are many songs to listen to!but sometimes there are glitches.",0
"Play bar disappears constantly. I'm frustrated that 50 percent of the time I start the app, I can't pause, skip, or play music. This issue started within the last seven days. Spotify needs to fix this issue. As others said, many of us pay for the service...",0
Recent changes make the app useless. I don't have a navigation bar half the time and constantly need to force close it,0
The app is not showing the lyrics for any song ... Only that issue,0
"I don't like Spotify cause other videos of song like playlist that i love is not even their! I more like YouTube that Spotify,i rather suffer listening to YouTube than Spotify. The only thing that is different about Spotify and YouTube is that you can play it while using other app and YouTube doesn't have it and some playlist from Spotify suck! And also the add you can't skip it ugh!",0
"Don't like the advertisements so much. Lately they've been getting lengthy with sometimes 5 in a row, which throws a wrench in my workout.",1
There is ABSOLUTELY NO reason why it should be 1/2 songs and 6 commercials. No I'm not giving your company any money until you pay your artists better! Especially better than podcasters!,0
I am really having a great time with spot since I really love listening to music at all times and now that I have it I do believe that this is a cloud nine for me as a music loverrrr,1
Volume adjustment doesn't exist and no equalizer setting,0
If you don't have Spotify premium then the adsssss are like more than the songs in play list basically it's a paid app only.,0
Very good app,1
What is going on Spotify? From the last three days I can't play songs properly. Songs stops mid way. No controlling mode to play stop replay songs. I thought I have been hacked or something. Changed pw reinstalled app but nothing works. I pay premium to listen to music without any issues. Please fix this asap.,0
"Andriod App is constantly bugging out and crashing. Stops playing randomly. Been having issues for months, nothing's been done about it. Requires a few restarts of app to work.",0
Add,1
Downloaded songs not available. A bug that hasn't been fixed for months,0
New version is soooooo glitchy but better than anything else. Fix the glitches plz,1
Nice sound quality,1
"(Update: there is a downloadng notification bug. Please check it.) Spotify listens to users and keeps improving. A brighter UI could comply with some people's esthetic taste, but that's a detail. Also it would help if it worked with Samsung Bixby voice commands but that is Samsung's stupidity, not Spotify's. Google Assistant voice commands have come a long way and work flawless 99% of the times. Congrats for that. It was the reason that I quit Spotify before, and now that it works I'm back.",0
So far so good,1
"That last couple update have systematically broken the app. Connections to devices are buggy and intermittent. UI has broken a dozen times a day and won't respond, play anything, and when it does the wrong item will show as playing versus the sound. Can't skip what it doesn't know it's playing!.. Reinstall and restarts are no help. ""No internet connection"" even when I am on the god damn wifi and in a city. Straight up broken at the moment.",0
Superb no ads we can listen music without putting the phone onn i really want that we can listen music without internet if we download like that option will be so helpful,0
"If Spotify can't fix our player problem where I need to drop Spotify and go to Pandora or Amazon music, please fix this problem Spotify that I pay you every month for this lousy service.",0
Good music app i like it very much.,1
This app is awesome you can listen to anything and it plays the same kind of music you like plus you can make your own playlist...,1
I'll would give it a better review but I just keep on getting a ton of ads like 4-5 every 2-3 songs and it gets annoying.,0
"Probably the best music and podcast streaming app. With minor issues and bugs. I trust the team, they are and will be fixing the problems.",1
"I really love this app, this app knows my music taste so well, good job!",1
Great app overall. It's just hard to get it to stop playing certain songs completely. Like I have to consistently remove songs I dislike from suggested playlists.,1
Worst app i didn't seen this type of adds while using the app for every song the adds will be displaying ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦. jio savan is better to listen music with less adds,0
"Update messed this app up ... now it plays with out being able to shut off. I have to reset phone. It doesn't give me options to switch songs. And it will no longer appear on my android autoplay. It's not my phone, it's the app for sure",0
I can't able to play song . I don't know why. When I used to play particular song. The apps Suddenly shut. And I threw out from the app.,0
When having Spotify premium this is the best app. But without it there are too many adds after every 3rd song there is a 30 sec add,0
"The latest update sucks! Always needing to connect to Bluetooth and it doesn't work, will be deactivating Spotify",0
"Doesn't miss a Beat! Love it, my go to app for music!",1
Everytime I open the app it tells me that I am offline even though I am clearly online and my internet is working just fine.,1
Downloads don't work is my main reasons or 1 star other Minor issues do exist one being the now playing bar that shows the current track is not visible to pause music. Using updated app on Samsung 21 ultra,0
"Ads in every 2nd song, premium is useless, no audio quality change and still can't download songs in your internal storage plsplspls don't download",0
Keep going to play my music that's saved where I donthave service and my Playlist is unsaved deserves negative stars,0
love this app!!! podcasts also help me a lot.,1
Too many ads and everything else is just awesome,1
"It's a good music app for Samsung's and Android, if you buy/get the family plane then you don't get the aids",1
"I have been a long time user of Spotify and loved it before, But here within the past few months, I can't watch any of my podcasts without it buffering every few seconds. Specifically the JRE podcast. When I try to watch the videos of them they just keep buffering, whether I'm on wifi or not. I am hoping someone can fix this soon or has a solution, as I have deleted and redownloaded it once already.",0
App is great I like the music it suggests.,1
Great app,1
"Not possible anymore to play/stop go to next or previous song, worked before just fine. Thanks to ""updates"". I might need to cancel the premium because of this.",0
This app was great at first but then it started glitching and freezing my screen i had to restart my laptop cause i thought it was the problem but it wasn't. I was working on a documentary while listening to music then it glitches then my whole screen froze and it turned off and turned back on with ALL my work gone!!!.. PLEASE FIX THIS MISTAKE.,0
Can't preview songs when adding them anymore,0
One of the best audio apps in the ganr,1
Been using for years and has always been an amazing app. Free or with the premium!!!,1
"Using premium version. Weird issue where if left alone it will play smoothly. However if I use Chrome or Twitter (or any other app really) while Spotify plays in the background, Spotify abruptly stops after a few seconds. No point reopening the app to press play because once I'm back using another app, Spotify abruptly stops again. Makes it useless to use unless I don't touch my phone while Spotify is playing. My phone is running Android 12. Please fix. EDIT: still an issue 4 months later.",0
Its a great app but recently when I play a song it use to pop up the song it's playing on my notifications but now I play a song and there is no way I know if its play like it's playing the song but not show the song info,0
Its a good app,1
Giving three stars rate because they give more and more ads after every two songs . So please stop more ads you can but less ads,0
"Not all the songs are available in our country. I was thinking about the premium but paying more than prime membership doesn't justify where they are offering multiple services for the price. And even if I buy the premium many songs aren't available which is really frustrating. Otherwise everything is good, I love the feature when I connect to my car audio.",1
"Very comfortable app, especially if you are invested in seamless experience across multiple devices",1
All the poor people are giving 1 star as they can t afford premium they dont know that all music have ad if u pay it goes away spotify Congo I have your premium on ios device and it is the best decision I made,1
A coworker asked us to share our playlist. So...I joined created my list & now I'm hooked!,1
"Truly enjoying Spotify, I have over 80 hours of hits, only issue is app doesn't play every song on the Playlist, it appears to be on about a 20 song loop. I've seen that many other users have that same issue. Please correct that. Thx!",0
Way better then xm. And I can always deal with ads at a free price,1
"Since last update this app has a problem waking and remembering to start from where I paused! And the crash won't allow me to control with remote on my headphones, Also the integration with the Spotiq ten equalizer is a nightmare for both to work together, never had these issues with Amazon music, don't think I will be paying for this at the end of my free trial......Shame!",0
Ive had spotify for almost 4 years I love it nothing better spotify has everything,1
Spotify is where it's at. I love I can play anything.,1
Nice,1
Good,1
Great except for the audiobook time Also missing more obscure albums from some artists but overall great,1
This ridiculous app keeps giving me notifications even when I completely disable them. It's so annoying that I'm just uninstalling. Good greif!,0
Love Spotify! I create my own playlists that are safe for my kids and in the classroom.,1
New to this but really enjoying the experience and fantastic selection of music,1
I love how I don't get bambarded with ads,1
Yeah I'm disappointed I recently upgraded to premium and that was fine for a while but after every update all my downloads dissappear and won't download again for ages. I was so looking forward to Spotify premium like all my friends but it just doesn't word for me,0
"Spotify, could you atleast let me skip any song? I don't get we have to use premium to play songs. Pretty sad that i can't even skip, i have to wait for a music to stop.",0
They need to update to many bugs it crashes to much. Sucks,0
Love it I have used Spotify for years and won't change. I love the layout and ease of use. I love the recommendations. Very good!,1
Nice and flexible plans depending on the need. Almost every song you can think of can be found here. Love the service. Recent ads aren't too bad as well..,1
"My phone is overheating, and stopping the app",0
I've paid for this for a while and the moment the payment is late or didn't go through for bank or centrelink reasons it goes back to please update payment. Maybe Spotify needs to improve that for it's regular and long term customers. I won't be using Spotify anymore,0
I have heard the same song 5x an hour every hour (if not more) listening to music at work using the premium trial. I can see some repeating songs listening for 8hrs but that is ridiculous. Plus after im already angry and wanting to cancel my subscription i can't even do it through the app,0
I love Spotify it's the on music app I have but the bad part is it don't work when you have no internet but other than that I have no other problems Spotify is amazing â˜ºï¸ðŸ™‚ðŸ™ƒðŸ˜!!!!,1
"I have a problem with the interface and how the songs are show in the second plane, because a song that I'm listening at the moment show the picture of the previous song that I have already listen. Fix the problem please.",0
"I am sorry for being rude, but this app is understandable I want to play a song but instead of playing the song I like it played another stupid song, why? Is it like that?. This app made me rage quit, I give it a 1 star in return.ðŸ˜¬",0
Worst experience after subscribing ringtone it is not applied,0
"Love it , so much better than I expected I dont know how but it chooses music for by bands I've never heard of and i really do enjoy them.",1
Excellent music app. I can find any music that I want to listen.,1
Awesome to be your own DJ and choose your favourite tracks to play.,1
Absolutely shite can't even listen to the song I want to super long ads just not as good as it is in consoles,0
Again Spotify is closing automaticall after 8.7.36.905. After the recent update I got on 27th whenever I am trying to play any song or podcast app is closing automatically. Fix this asap. Device - IQOO 7 Their customer care wasted my 2 days but telling me to do the basic troubleshooting steps. They also don't know how to solve the issue. I didn't see this type of customer care services Edit: After today's update Spotify is working perfectly. One star less for their useless customer support team,0
Forced to play setlists in random is awful. There are reasons why songs are in a certain order. Something is lost. It's like ordering a margarita and drinking all of the ingredients separately. Its just not the same thing.,0
This app is great but It's really annoying with the 30 minutes of no adds to having close to 30 minutes worth of adds,0
The app is great. I just don't know why the canvas feature doesn't work,0
Spotify is DOPE!ðŸ’¯,0
"Looking for an alternative. In addition to spreading misinformation around critical health issues, Spotify has totally predictable artist playlists that pay no attention to my preferences. It often sounds like top 40 radio. It is completely useless for voice controlled classical music, playing a movement (or less) of a requested work before playing something else.",0
Its good but could use improvements like with billing please tell the tax i live in Kentucky and would like to know how much sales tax i being charged other than that its a good app.Good job guys who made this app.,1
Awesome. This is best music app by far,1
"It's good , I like the free lyrics and the playlist!",1
Good quality for hearing music,1
"The app is absolutely amazing, I haven't encountered any problems with it but if you love music then I 100% recommend this app!",1
"The ads have gotten absolutely out of control. Had an ad that said I would have 30 min of listening ad free. Well in that 30 min I had an ad IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONG then 3 ads, 1 song then another 3 ads. I've heard more ads than music for the last month. I cant afford premium right now but this is not how you treat free users if you ever want them to give you money.",0
"Its Very Nice To Use When i was Started atleast After 5 Song Shown Add,,,But Nowadays This App Is Not Good Bcz Every 2 Song Between Its Showing Advertisement ðŸ˜’",0
Now playing bar missing regularly since last update and music stopping randomly. The time taken so far to identify and implement a fix has been too long.,0
"What's it with this update?!ðŸ˜¤ I can't view notifications, I can't see video podcasts. It's become really annoying lately, I've cleared data, cleared cache followed all the troubleshooting steps even uninstalled and reinstalled yet all that's still intact is the sound quality. I might cancel my subscription if nothing is done with next update.",0
"It is a really cool app and has a ton of songs... But whenever you search for a song and you play it then you are lucky if it actually plays the song instead of a whole other thing, and when I choose a song from favorites it will only play a random 5 seconds in the song",1
Plays favourite podcast and has a wide variety of music and stories.,1
99% of the time I find what I'm looking for. Sometimes they are way out in left field to find. This is a great site.,1
"App has stopped working, uninstall and reinstalled didn't fix it. Other apps work fine",0
"Very lousy,always plays songs that is not in my playlist,and sometimes i have to wait a couple days to allow to skip song again",0
Excellent music. Even better playlists!,1
"I really enjoying spotify, the bestest app for listening music,stories and more. I spent more my time on spotify",1
"Great music,all the songs l grew up with at the push of a button.",1
Worth the money and have great playlists love you can listen offline,1
It's has every music It's true that music is medicine,1
"Been using Spotify for years and I hate to do this, but for the last couple of days, the audio either buffers a lot, or pauses and plays often, just killing the experience. This happens when I lock the phone. Not when the app is in foreground. I know the internet is good because other video streaming apps work fine. Really is an irritating experience when you spend a lot of money on premium and on a flagship phone. Hope this can be solved in an update!",0
Incredible app but the group sessions work better before when you could scan to connect.,0
I have very little to no issues most days on this app. It's a really good music app.,1
"Last update was trash, please fix it",0
All of a sudden this app stopped working. I pay for spotify and it's constantly crashing and closing out unprompted. I updated it and now it cleared all my playlists and STILL crashes and now I can't play any songs period. Beyond frustrating.,0
Great music variety and few ads! Excellent!!!,1
New update rearranged play controls. It's horrible.,0
The best at this music streaming platform,1
Very useful worksVery affordable Its the perfect app for music,1
"I've had Spotify premium for five years now and have never once had a complaint. This new update on the other hand is really darn irritating. It's glitchy, sometimes doesn't open, or won't play songs at all. Even taking 5 or more minutes to load. That or all the playlists show up blank until restarting my phone itself. Next up is why on earth did they move the play button to the freaking left instead of in the middle of the forward and backwards buttons??? That's far from helpful, it sucks.",0
Multiple music choices grate app I like how it can link to my TV and I can use my phone as a remote,0
Literally the only good thing about this app is you can listen to smaller bands that you can't really listen to otherwise. Besides that there is commercials every 3-4 songs and most of the time is 4 commercials and sometimes the same commercial plays 2-3 times. Other than that the menus are basic and boring and a pain to navigate because when you add a song it puts in 5 unrelated or trash songs and now you have to go find the songs you wanted to add next just for it to add more trash in the way.,0
"The app is easy to use and there's a bunch of different music, not just the popular ones. There are good podcasts and stories, too. The reason I'm rating a 3 is maily for the glitching. The app will shut down or stop playing music for no apparent reason. This happens on my iPhone and laptop. Also, the ads are too much. For the most part I'm fine with them, until there's 4 or 5 of them in a row. It just gets annoying. One or two would be good.",0
I love it I can play my music whenever I want to and loud as I want to and nobody has to hear it thank you Spotify,1
This is a good if you get premium otherwise it sucks,0
Why does Spotify webplayer soes not work properly? It's stopping in the middle and we have to refresh the page to play again?!!! Please fix this problem...,0
Good app Good music,1
It's a great app but you can't really choose the song you want to play and if you run out of so g that your playlist randomized it just gives you random song that you might not even like and then pretty much forces you to buy premium,0
Useless on Android. Why is it different on iOS? Will not let you skip songs. Using Spotify to find music and playing it on YouTube instead.,0
"Good , but it will be better if i can chose music i want on a phone",0
Its been great keep up the good work freedoms of speech!,1
They keep charging me when I cancel even threw my bank . Over a yr ago ..stop charging g my card,0
It just a very good app. Only down side is it glitches sometimes.,1
I'am a nonpremium user ... I hate this app now ...ðŸ˜¢ Because ðŸ˜¥I can't play my favourite songs. ðŸ˜” Songs are playing in shuffle. ðŸ˜Ÿ Only 6 skips per hour. ðŸ™ Totally this app's new updates are very bad now ... Such new updates & Conditions are of concern to all nonpremium users...ðŸ¥º Please remove such conditions for the nonpremium users ...ðŸ™‚,0
"Spotify has been working well lately. My only issue is I can't play my liked song playlist/library on my Sonos radio. I just get an error message. Not sure who is behind this error, Sonos or Spotify.",0
"I have Premium, Spotify is great, but the app itself is clunky, doesn't feel smooth to browse between menus and playlists, it's like having a 1 second delay on everything you do on the app. Overall, minus the clunkiness, the app is great. Still waiting for the heavily requested A-B loop feature.",0
SONG LYRICS BACKGROUND COLOR. the new bright colors hurt to look at. I liked the version where it was PASTEL OR MUTED colors ðŸ¥º,0
Too much advertisement.......and playlists are not perfect...there are another songs too in a particular playlist.......,0
"JUST FYI Spotify is Liscensed by BMI If you truly love music, then Spotify is the best for music period! BEST SOUND, QUALITY LARGEST PLATFORM IN THE WORLD. THIS IS WHERE THE BEST RADIO PODCAST IS ""SPOTIFY RADIO""",1
"Spotify should change its name from spotify to adstify, very good platform for listening to ads.",0
It give me my time off and think what and how good it sound,1
Premium is simply the best way to go. Affordable and being able to download your playlists are absolutely fantastic. Great quality of life if your service is spotty,1
Find myself getting a bit frustrated with Spotify app lately. Everytime I come off Spotify and go back in it doesn't let me pause fast forward songs have to refresh my phone everytime becoming annoying,0
"only useful if you pay for premium, and if you do pay, then it's very good",1
"The only place where I can get both music and podcasts. Great! I would not live without it. The only reason I do not have premium anymore is that I have got another music streaming service through my phone subscribtion - if I had not, I would definitely still subscribe to Spotify. Edit: have you considered adding ratings to your podcasts/songs? That would be nice.",0
"After the update I can't see my 2021 rewind, when I click on it the app crashes do something & Too many ads! 8 ads in a row! Are you kidding me!? Why dont u people just stop providing music in this app & make it a ""advertisement"" app filled with ads and nothing else!",0
"The app stops playing podcasts while I am driving. It re starts after a short pause. Have tried to delete and reinstall app but hasn't fix the issue. After several re starts, the app stops playing. Open the app and it looks like it closes and re opens and then re plays the podcast from the beginning.",0
"Excellent experience. My music, my style, my life... everything I want in one spot... Spotify! Nothing else!",1
New bug: the now-playing bar keeps disappearing and only comes back after force closing the app in the settings. Songs would play but cannot be paused.,0
"Update has ruined ability to seamlessly transition from PC to mobile or vice versa. When you create a radio using a song as a base it shouldn't recommend 30 songs you already like, wasting time.",0
I love it! Organise my play lists listen in the car the shower and on the beach even while I'm ironingðŸ¤ª,1
"I play Spotify when I'm driving, cooking, taking a shower, almost every moment of my life.life is fun with Spotify!!",1
cant listen to downloaded stuff when offline,0
I just love the fact that Spotify has all the music im into,1
Spotify was good.....until..... They stop putting your song that was in your playlist well I don't know if it's only me or....,0
Im greatful to listen songs on Spotify,1
"The best ever music app after Google play store, with great quality sound n other effects. Specially the premium plan is so worth it. ðŸ‘ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‡",1
why cant the feature that allows you to see what ur friends are currently listening to be on mobile and not just pc? i think my experience would be boosted like 80% more. Its such a pity. YES spotify should in a way be a socmed app. idc if it ruins my mental health and makes me more self conscious of what others think of me. as if i could ever get enough of that. this feature would be a game changer IM TELLING YOU.,0
"The music keeps stopping every 10 minutes. Fix your damn app, you're a multi million company and your only job is to play music....",0
Streaming is bad even when with strong WiFi connection.,0
"Spotify removed my progress bar... so how do I skip, shuffle, repeat or pause a song? I can't. They call this progress? If it isn't broke don't fix it. The app was good.",0
This app is good but you should add the function of amplifier,1
"I just wanna recommend adding the music search quality like ""Shazam"". The one where we can know a song name quicker",0
"Why does this app all of a sudden ask me to connect to Bluetooth. When I do, it doesn't even let me control the app from the car half the time. Who was in charge of this update? Fire them immediately.",0
"The app is good, but I did not out 5 stars because for some reason I can no longer loop songs. I wish there was more that I could do WITHOUT having to pay in order to do simple things..",0
The App is amazing but the newest update has been quite Annoying. When I'm trying to play my playlist it always goes to some recommended songs which I can't skip.,0
"i 'm going to hate this app , i can't skip the song that spotify recommended and i wanted to listen to the song that i want but i can't skip it and then when you skip it there's ads and recommending if i want a premium but i don't have money for that , why? , i wanted to listen okay that's all . btw i alr hate this app so much super super but i 'll download it again cause i wanted to listen ok ok ok ok :))",1
"I love Spotify!!, the problem is they're stupid app!!! Constantly malfunctions...drives me nuts when I'm working with gloves on and it randomly stop playing ever 10-40 minutes. Gotta stop what I'm doing, take off gloved, dig phone out of pocket, fix whatever is wrong with the app this time and repeat...all day long... ive Uninstalled, updated, contacted support, still does it, making it basically unlistenable and usless. Now have to convince Rogan to go somewhere else!!",0
"Overall the best music app, but glitchy. App will break at random and parts will disappear. Songs i have liked will not have the heart checked, but will showup in my liked songs. Car mode voice controls do not work. Some parts are getting better but some are also getting worse.",0
"Spotify has been my top choice for music, but these new updates are just not it. Nothing but the ads are running smoothly. I mean, the app is breaking so badly, I don't know if it's a ridiculous glitch or something but its irritating. There is constantly showing a sign that it's not connected to internet which is of course not right, my internet is working perfectly. Please, fix the issues ASAP.",0
"Great app, but recently it will shut down randomly after a few songs, which has been disappointing. Fix this and I would give 5 stars.",0
i cant even listen to my playlist they got a random song playing it's not what i added on my playlist ! Yall changed yall app up for another dollar and its sad . Miss me with Spotify ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¾ðŸ–•ðŸ¾,0
Used up all my data in offline mode. Really screwed up things for when I needed data for work. Not cool.. Not cool at all.,0
how come I cant play my playlist songs im only able to play samples of my songs on my playlist. what is up with that my playlist has 100 songs and thats my life so please fix that issue. idk what to do im crying rn plssss.,0
"This is just a suggestion for the next update put somewhere on there how many times you've listened to a specific song, just saying that'd be pretty cool.",0
I'm so pissed with the ads. I can't listen to the songs without an ad popping after every 2 songs. Ig I'm going to install Some other app.,0
"Like music, must have,very good ðŸ‘",1
Please don't add to our playlists please I love the app nonetheless,1
It helps a lot it doesnt give you adds that much and you can turn your screen off and listen to music at the same time unlike YouTube or any other rip off app spotify is the best app ever and I recommend itðŸ˜ðŸ‘,1
Love the music and sports talk shows,1
"Just lost my wife of 58 years. Spotify is helping with the grief, The unbelievable grief.",1
"Doesn't work off-line. I live in an area of low reception and often need to listen off-line. Recently this feature has stopped working. Spotify's solution? Delete the 100s of saved albums and reinstall the app. Worse than useless, I'm moving over to Tidal.",0
PERFORM,1
"Terrible since latest update. As others have pointed out, the play bar dissappears and its impossible to stop or skip a song or podcast.",0
skips...doesnt show time on small screen have to reload...,0
"Spotify in my opinion is easy to use ,reliable and at affordable price",1
"I've been a paying customer for years, without any major problems. The last update has to be the worst, I am experiencing all the problems stated by everyone else (from latest reviews). The app is barely usable at best please resolve these issues promptly.",0
"Every time I click a song, spotify will stop all music for 15 seconds before it starts playing the song",0
App stopped working on Pixel 6 with latest update. Force closes instantly.,0
I started listening song through Spotify and i am so satisfied,1
This app is very useful to me. But sometimes when I have a long playlist it plays different songs that aren't in my playlist and I tried uninstalling it but it kept doing thatðŸ˜…,0
"Dumb app. How are you gonna recommend a new single from a band to me, then when I click to play it, it plays a song from a different band. Many other issues, entire app seems unintuitive.",0
In your liked songs there is a spot where you can pick a genre. It won't let me scroll though go pick out what I want to listen to,1
I'm really really irritated that you only get six skips in your liked list. What if I'm not in the mood to listen to a song that I like? At LEAST give us unlimited skips in our own Playlists. Please. I know I'm not the only one frustrated.,0
Horrible I can only use the app internationally for 14 days what kind of nonsense are you guys doing it makes no sense whatsoever because I don't live in the states or any big country I live on a small islands and because of that I can't stream music on my ps4 nonsense this is has to be some kind of joke if anyone could give me a good reason on why they would do this please let me know,0
Never plays the song you want it to. Always plays something you've never heard of before. How is this even a built in app. It's so bad. Oh also screw you,0
"I'm paying for premium and within ONE song, the music will disconnect from my speaker, or simply just stop playing on phone. It is INFURIATING because I love how easy it is to find new music on Spotify, but I can't even enjoy two songs back to back being played in a Playlist lol",0
"Stop with the damn ads, you say listen to an ad to get 30 minutes of free ads and then you show like 5 or more ads and not even after 2 or 3 songs later you get another repetitive ad. I mean seriously I'm trying to relax but I cant with these wack ads with there dumb humors and not to mention some with them singing something, like seriously just shut up.",0
"I love this app. ads are abundant, but I have free premium right now so it's not an issue. best app for playing music; helps me find new music while listening to my existing loves. 5/5 ðŸ˜Š",0
"bad sound quality, damn i wish i can refund my purchase on premium package",0
This is my the most favorite music app I love it thanks Spotify for the best music's Thank you ðŸ˜Š,1
"During the birthing throes of the interweb, their was a music algorithym that would tantalize the soul with sounds close to your liking based on the least prompting frim the user. Alas, as moon landing equipment has also become too complex for this now, 126 years later, an arcane and worfully incompetent modern technology couldnt dare venture a decent musical guess. At $13.99. A month. Jesus its trash.",0
Messing up a duo plan is kinda annoying to fix. But it's a good service.,1
"Favorite music streaming app. Been using it for years along with Premium and have had little to few problems. Imo, worth the $10 a month. By being a beta tester (which I am as well), you can test new things they're thinking about adding to the app for a short period of time and its quite interesting!",1
It's great and really Easy to use xx,1
ITS THE BEST YOU NEED TO TRY IT OUT AND YOU CAN SEE YOUR FAVOURITE YOUTUBER TRY IT NOW,1
Downloaded song not play without internet. Very disappointed by this app. This is my first experience in spotify which is very bad.,0
Recent app update has stopped it working with car head unit Spotify app. Bluetooth streaming works but no app ... says No Device Connected so no control,0
Best app i have ever seen and discovered ðŸ’œ Every type of songs are available in this appðŸŒ· No ads and no more bugs/glitchesðŸ¥€ my experience was great with this app but i can't download the songs.... I wanna download my favorite songs in my folders but it is not downloading it and i don't even know how to download songs! You just have to download your music/songs with over all i loved it really unique and amazing appðŸŒ â„ï¸â˜„ï¸ See aa,1
Just sensational ,1
"Paying for premium still results in adds/commercials when listening to podcasts. Additionally, Joe Rogan uses racist terms (new video showing it) and my wife and kids are black - not cool with that. I appreciated the different viewpoints and multitude of topics he brought to his show, but I can't support a company or individual who is blatantly racist or uses racist terminology. I ended my subscription and deleted the app until this mess is resolved. Lots of issues at Spotify over this guy.",0
"Spotify is a must have for music enthusiast, professionals and those who want to experience the true gift of sound.",1
Spotify is music to my ears literally.,1
When i try to listen to one song it takes me to one that like ive never heard of and i have to make a playlist when i want to listen to one song but it adds 1000 other things like can i listen to the things i wanna listen to like i'll be vibing to fire drill and then a random song comes on that ive never heard of before,0
"M Ã±ot able to login pls help , they say, pls check internet connection but everything is clear from my side.",1
It adds terrible music to your own playlist without permission,0
Alot of bugs currently in the app. Super frustrating.,0
"Wonderful! I would love a bit more intuition for the Android app like the Apple version is, but it does the job. Most of my songs recommended aren't similar to what I listen to, but you'll find a nugget or two. Neat stuff",1
Great music and much more,1
Too much advertising,0
"THIS APP IS BUGGY TOO OFTEN IF YOU DON'T UPDATE IT AND EVEN IF YOU UPDATED IT IT'S STILL BUGGING BUT NOT TOO OFTEN. SO THE QUESTION IS, IS IT WORTH PAYING $10-15 PER MONTH? HELL NO! I PAY TO HAVE A GOOD QUALITY TIME LISTENING MUSIC, NOT A BUGGY APP THAT STOP MY FAVE MUSIC RANDOMLY! PLS FIX YOUR APP!",0
"Great selection of music and podcasts. I like the intuitive nature of the playlists where Spotify will suggest similar songs to what you have added, plus their curated playlists based on your likes. However, the app is Hella frustrating at times. My version is up to date but app will sometimes require me to shut it down and restart it several times before I can use it and control it. Sometimes the music/podcast will play without having the ability to pause/skip/play. Love it, but frustrating",0
"I can't say enough good things about Spotify. Amazing value, and I get to share my family plan account with up to 5 members of my household? Easily the best streaming service available for people who live musical lives and enjoy the ability to take deep dives back into the past works and discographies from some of the best artists from any era.",1
Functionality is pretty good. Seems to be a resource hog at times and will not work if I have any other apps open. Wish they would pay artists more. Overall the most popular music app so yeah.,0
"Soft ,crestal clear sound;also, features to create playlists and more; recommendations for listening according to our past hearing are really pretty useful and good.Just one black spot-too many ads without primium which irritates and spoils mood.",1
Pretty good app.I love it shuffle mode and I recommend it ðŸ‘Œ,1
Hey there . I am daily listener of Spotify.And I also want a primium subscribtion. So I request you to add a reedeem gift code payment method to primium plan. Thanku.,0
Unusable if you don't pay for premium. Don't bother.,0
I love spotify it works really well. the only thing i dont like about it is that you HAVE to get premium to download music.,0
"You are celebrating black artists this month, which month is for white artists? ""Inclusion is Universal"", unless you are of European descent. How long has Spotify been using racism in advertising? Perhaps an Ombudsman should be contacted.",1
New update is buggy. Doesn't auto pause when I leave my vehicle. Also I gave to force close the app a few times a day to get it to act like it's connected or the cars media buttons don't work and it doesn't display media info. This wasn't a problem a few weeks ago.,0
Great app never crashes.. I'm on Android,1
I have had this app since 2012. In the last week it no longer will download songs and play them offline. It's weird. I will be canceling all 4 of my accounts. I prefer YouTube music instead. I problem cleared up. I bought a kenwood stereo that has spotify on but will not properly connect not matter what I do. Apparently no one can. Wasted opportunity on kenwood and Spotify. Seems like everything is half-assed now,0
Amazing but you only get ads after listening to a couple of songs ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜˜,0
"Stable and easy to use with a vast library of music across multiple genres as well as many of the more popular podcasts. A very useful feature is the ability to toggle between 3 levels of quality which directly impacts the storage space used for downloads. Overall, I am pleased so far with the value I am getting.",1
The latest update really messed it up. Like it doesn't show the song that I am listening to at all. And earlier it was just randomly adding songs to my Playlist. And now I can't even see what I'm listening to.,0
"Great library, excellent sound.",1
When i try to play a song it close by itself and take me to the page where i was before i open spotify,0
"I love using this app, things that I want to listen to are easy to find. The only thing that I don't like is that if I pause a podcast and come back later, I have to close it completely and reopen it to be able to cast it to my Google nest.",0
"Spotify has logged me out of my account. When I try log in, it says the password is incorrect, when I try to log in without a password, it says that this account does not exist/there is no account with that email. Whenever I try make a new account with my email that is supposedly non existent on the Spotify database, it says I have an account and it takes me to the log in page, to repeat the same process again. GIVE MY ACCOUT BACK PLEASE",0
All music is free They have every song Couldn't be better for value,0
Shuffle is not really good. Out if for example 500 songs it keeps repeating the same 30 songs over and over. Quit annoying honestly. I don't know if I did something in my setting. Another example If you search and play a new song the following once will always be something that's been played a 1000 times. Very annoying,0
"Past few days it has been not playing at all, will stop mid song, or the whole app will just close without a crash report. Also isn't showing up on my lock screen anymore to see what is playing or be able to turn the song.",0
Best app for music for the entire family!!,1
"Nice app for songs,musics and podcasts. ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©",1
"Crazy looking when it comes on. A whole lot of people's music on the home page I never heard of and have no interest in. Hard to find music lists I set up for myself and these are often cut into by more music I never chose to listen to and don't want to hear. No way would I ever pay for such a ramshackle mess. Unfortunately, now Jango looks the same. It's disgusting, to say the least. And why is my account info listed with my review, to force me to make nice? Not happening.",0
Great for my music and podcasts.,1
The recent update doesn't work on wifi. I tried uninstalling and installing again numerous times but it doesn't work. Kindly fix.,0
"It's an Amazing app, just remember to clear your cache once in a while! :)",1
It's awful I download podcast an with my screen open an left on the page it pauses constantly. With in one podcast it skips to the end or the next episode. It's really annoying none of my other apps do this it needs to be fixed!!!,0
Wish it would play on my watch when my phone isn't on,0
"Good app but I cannot log in from my computer. I am typing the right password, the right username but I CANNOT log in. I've been trying for the past hour to. Unneceptable",0
Update 2022 May 9. Now I can't add a song to a Playlist without it taking me to the top of the Playlist and causing me to lose my spot. FIX YOUR APP!!!,0
Great sound quality for the subscription price pm,1
Nothing on yt premium! Why anybody would get spotify premium when YouTube premium exists is beyond me. Yt has 1000 times as much music and you get every yt video ad free! Spotify is inferior in every way and pointless.,0
I am a premium user and to my horror i cannot listen to music offline after downloading the songs i chose. I think if you list this feature as a PREMIUM feature it should actually work unless this was a lie to get people to purchase subscriptions. I hope to get my money back. I do not appreciate being lied to. Deliver on what you promise or loose potential users. There is other apps like this one that they can use.,0
Lots of ads but other than that it's a great app to use especially if you're not great at making playlist cuz I have lots of those ready to go,1
Lot of issues with frequent pausing and and the play bar isn't showing up when I select a song.,0
"I have this app downloaded 100% to listen to Joe Rogan. However, I don't like clutter so when I initially switched I was fully planning on using it for all my podcasts and music so I could get rid of my Pocketcast and YouTube Music apps and consolidate thay into one. However, the podcast catcher is literally soooo unusable that it was impossible to have a seamless experience. With how many developers are surely on the Spotify team, I'd at least look at how other apps are doing it.",0
"Too political. I don't want the politics, just the music. Drop the politics Spotify, I thought I was buying a music service, not a political platform. Sheesh...",0
"Very awesome, allows you to listen to worship music without any interuptions and still has minimal ads",1
I was trying to listen to this one song and it didnt let me it also kept putting songs into my playlist and never let me listen to what I want,1
Love this app. Noticed a problem in the last few days. Maybe after last update? Sometimes the bar at the bottom of my phone showing what is playing disappears.,0
Not really a fan of a platform that continue to support racism and misinformation.,0
"All The Music You Want, Just The Playlists You Need. Content Increases Daily.",0
You should improve how to download the song. It's very difficult if I want only some song from the album.,0
"The sound quality is amazing , I've been using the app for some time now. There is a major issue with the network and loading , all other apps (including other music apps) work absolutely fine on my phone with the current network. Except Spotify , it doesn't load at all. After many attempts at restarting the app , it sometimes works well. No problems with any other features though ðŸ‘",1
I am not a big fan of any advertising other than that I really enjoy the variety of artist and listening to my favorite songs of my past and present artists I was gifted an AQURBOOST BOOM speaker for Xmas which I use to accompany Spotify this 5 star app. Thank you and bless you.,1
Third Grade application. It keeps on hanging and lagging. Everything is working fine but this damn application. Worst experience ever.,0
Really good but I can't listing to songs on it because it plays the album the songs in.,1
Great music without any interference,1
"I have internet connection but spotify wont go online, so i can only play downloaded music. This has happened A LOT of times. I've tried to uninstall it, and reinstall but its not working, i used to work. I'm so mad at this pls fix it! fixed!!",0
Very good experience,1
Great app for music. The fact I cant preview a song before I add it to a playlist now kind of annoys me. My memory isn't great and that feature was great but you got rid of it because??,0
Nice experience handy would love to have my liked shuffled more so that albums are split and mixed more. What I mean is that I would like individual songs to be identified and played from different authors.,0
"Ive been subscribing spotify for over a year now, and i realized that its worth it, thanks for such app!",1
I have been a long time customer with Spotify in my opinion they are the best despite few hiccups I would recommend anyone to load this app and enjoy the music they have to offer you won't regret it I don't I love Spotify,1
Steady premium user for the past 3 years and I've notice the app slowly decline in terms of stability. Wish they would address these bugs.,0
This app is terrible for free users honestly I can end it all here. For free users you can't freely choose the songs you want to listen too not skip not even and there will be an ad every 2-3 songs in. That said there is still a wide range of music available I like it's recommendation algorithms. So overall it's still a very solid app but only if you want to buy premium.,0
I get that it wants me to get the premium but it is IMPOSSIBLE to listen to the one song I want to hear I made a Playlist that had ONE song in it but when I tried to listen to it Spotify gave me 8 suggested songs before the ONE I wanted to hear and half the time the suggested songs are terrible so they should get rid of that or give you the option to turn it off,0
This is probably the best app to listen to music,1
The customer service is terrible. Even after reporting an issue of hacking of a song nothing has been done. It has been 48 hours and a non authorised song is occupying the place of another one on major playlists.,0
"It was best. But the indian spotify sucks. Not every song is available, and the most popular songs are also not available. What do we do with this application when there are no songs which we want to listen to and love listening them",0
Ease of finding my colossal music choices and all the futuristic extras that really shift the atmosphere.,1
Good music updates really awesome ðŸ‘,1
Slow to operate is my most frustrating complaint. Recommends same songs over and over. discorery weekly is half bands ive already heard and have saved albums of. Recommendations could be better for sure.,0
Plays songs that are not in my playlist when I click on the play button in the playlist not the first time this has done this,0
"Its very convenient, I use the app everyday",0
Nice song app,1
"Stop adding random songs to playlists! It's stupid and annoying, it makes people want to stop using Spotify at all if you keep doing it!",0
Once Spotify know your music tastes they encourage you to increase your music lists with different artists having similar music likes. Yes to that.,1
"I would have given it 5 ,but there's every other day that the app just keeps playing none stop and it doesn't show me the pause button at all. For example the past 2 days. It's very annoying",0
Very easy and so nice system of music,1
"It is a good music app, it just has too many ads. But what's been happening to me is that I can't see all my playlists or liked songs, meaning I can't listen to anything. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it but that didn't work, it's definitely not the account either because it works on my other phone and laptop. So I'm just hoping it gets fixed because this is a pretty good music app in my opinion.",0
"I started having issues when going through my playlists. When I scroll through, it keeps crashing. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app but that didn't fix it. I've also restarted my phone. I'm not sure what else to do. Edit: Latest update did not solve this. It has only made it worse. The app freezes a lot and the crashing has become more frequent.",0
I love Spotify! Please keep making the app better! We need In it to win it by saliva back on Spotify,1
Widget is back! Thank you,1
The app does this thing where it doesn't allow me to rewind and re listen to bits I may have missed on podcasts especially.,0
It is not working properly. After one or two songs it automatically stops.,0
Every time the youtube TV add plays it repeats 3 times it's annoying,0
I get an ad and then it tells me i have the next 30 minutes of ad-free music a d then 4 2 minute songs later i get an ad. A good music app stays true to its word.,1
The experience in this app is amazing not to say that its bad or something all I would simply want is that if u make a Playlist or like songs and go to library u can select that song to play the whole song not just a few seconds of it.. I hope u understand what I mean but everything else on the app is fireðŸ¤˜,1
Everything was alright but... Suddenly it logged out and now I can't log in,0
It doesn't let you play the songs you want to play it doesn't let you play the songs in your play list unless you pay. Plus it's super glitchy from the latest updates.,0
This app is garbage. It doesnt let you play the exact music you want to listen to. The rewind button is useless and you can only skip a few times. It's impossible to play songs from the playlist I created and only plays random songs that are not in the playlist.,0
My go to music steaming service! I've discovered tins of new music and artists with Spotify!,1
"I wanted to listen to some Rogan podcasts, so I had to install Spotify. What a pos app. It lags, skips, leaks memory, and is unstable. I have to reboot my phone every time I use it. No other app gives me these issues. F Spotify.",0
Continuing to host content that spreads misinformation is spineless and profit-driven. Be better.,0
Pretty good working with Google be better if billing could be added to phone bill.,1
Chiiiis love ,1
"It was fine, now it keeps crashing..",1
Highly recommend this app! The only flaws are how many skips you get. Hope you enjoy if you decide to get it!,1
This app is horrible for podcasts. I like listening to podcasts on my commute to work. It's about a 20 min drive to and from work. I have yet to finish a podcast without this app losing my spot especially after ads.,0
"Lagging and bugging and crashing, what the heck?! Otherwise its a great app",0
"Every week, the app logs me out and I have to delete it and reinstall.",0
"Pls fix the bug, when I open to play it the apps stop itself and I can't hear any music!!!!",0
"uhm, yes. affordable price of premium.",1
"It keeps giving me suggested songs when I turned the option off, can't listen to a certain song it gives you a random song by them or similar if you have a pc get the pc version please.",0
"cannot go back, always stucks on loading screen, not fixed for a quite long time. Now music stops suddenly and it is not possible to go to the now playing screen",0
I use to really like the app now I can't change the music when I please. The play bar is messed up and we'll not even can be used anymore. What's up with that.,0
"It has virtually EVERY song I want, only a select few I have to go to YouTube for, so it's a really convenient app to have if you're a music junkie!",0
Cool,1
"Not okay, I'm in Luxembourg and the Lidl add is ridiculously loud compared to the rest of the audio. Everytime it comes I have to remove my earphones or change the volume immediately because I might end up deaf. It's incredibly annoying, it should be fixed",0
I love your stories I'm literally addicted to them... It brings me back to my childhood when I use to watch Are You Afraid of the Dark and when I use to read Goosebumps book. I appreciate this podcast â¤ï¸,1
Just all round good stuff,1
Last two weeks its not work properly alws crashed nd shut down not happy,0
It is the best app for streaming music ðŸŽ¶,1
Not user feiendly very complicated ap struggling to understand how it works,0
"Update has made ads play after every. Single. Song. Radio plays less ads than spotify. And its the same ads everytime. If you're reading this spotify, you're trash and greedy.",0
"Even with autoplay off for similar songs, whenever I start playing a playlist it plays songs that are suggested and not from the actual Playlist.",0
I've had spotify premium for almost 2 years now and it was amazing but now they throw in ads when you listen to podcasts. What's the point of advertising ad free when it isn't. I'm going to try YouTube trial before I officially switch.,0
please bring back the feature that we can put the playlist we want on our profile,1
It's wonderful because I have a car with which now I can use Bluetooth to play Spotify!,1
Best audio quality,1
"Spotify is refreshing. Edit: 2 years later, I'm still loving it. Great app and UI. Kudos to the engineering and product design team.",1
Good service. App freezes on one track and qont change at the bottom even when new tracks play. F ing annoying.,0
Spotify loves to pepper you with content that's not relevant even though ive never listened to shows or podcasts or have absolutely no interest in Michelle obama I'm constantly pestered with it can't wait to go elsewhere ðŸ‘ŽðŸ»ðŸ™„,0
Love it. Getting all my favorites.,1
i love it beacause like when u play somthing and it does not have a sound you just play it and enjoy the music i love spotify,1
That is very good song lestining app.,1
My experience isn't bad beside being a musician. It's the best music app forever in my views.,1
"Great app! I enjoy the quality . it would be cool if we could downloud music, AND get ability to skip songs and play songs in a specific order, i get they use premium for money, but just do a no ads thing instead.",0
Great device brilliant acsess to the music I like,1
"The latest update is a mess. Please fix the bugs. I can't pause my music or even skip, it stalls and pops on without a warning.",0
To many ads  now you have to give money to listen songs seriously,1
all my downloads have disappeared.. the app can't play songs again,0
"I'm not sure why, but recently the scroll bar which you can grab on to when sliding down your playlist (which will show and allow you to reach A - Z or Dated Added Songs) is not there/or not interactable anymore. Possible since a really recent update. I'm not sure why it was removed, but I feel its a very unfair thing, especially to members.",0
I love Spotify I get all the music I enjoy and even more I may have forgotten about in one place.,0
Hate the adds but love the app,1
I can't be the only person that's having this issue of not being able to listen to my downloaded songs offline. That's the whole reason I downloaded them. It's quite annoying and inconvenient and I hope it's fixed in the soonest,0
"Normally the app works really well but recently the app was glitchy, I had log out and back in to select songs. Normally I'd give a 4 but until this issue is patched I gove it a 3",0
Has everything you need on the app when comes to music app,1
"Hi! It would be a really useful tool if we get to see who liked our spotify playlists, thank you!",1
It used to be perfect but now it shows u are offline when ever I'm on wifi but works fine on mobile data... It is annoying because I can't download my songs on mobile data and on wifi it shows you are offline,0
"I use this app all the time and overall I'd recommend, but it's a bit buggy of late, seemingly after every android update. Pausing during tracks like it's buffering, control buttons disappearing, refusing to pause or shut down. Reinstall of the app usually fixes it, but no one wants to be doing that every time and all tracks are forgotten when you do",0
Best music app no issues or any bugs,1
I can choose a great variety and I am alwsys pleased with the similar suggedtions.,1
Very exceptional and lov u to the moon and back,1
Ads are so much forcing for premium but overall app's sound quality is very good also better than gaana and Saavn.,1
"You can only enjoy spotify with the subscription. When you don't, there are so many bad things. The menus are more frustrating, it constantly recommends songs, and it switches to those recommended songs when you try to listen to your playlist.",0
"Good app overall but the Android Auto interface needs a lot of work. Also, the moment they cancel Joe Rogan, I'm uninstalling Spotify.",0
Payed subscription to a service to get rid of ads and listen to music offline but it pauses and stops all the time even on the music i have downloaded try to fix the issue from the help options and its still doing it.(update) the original issue was fixed by buying a new phone but now podcasts that are downloaded will stop when you lose reception,0
Constantly crashes with podcasts which is annoying. Plus the podcast video player could really use an update.,0
"The Perfect Music App For Every Tastes.. It Even Has Some Really Rare Musics Which I Didn't Even Expected To Find Here.. And At Least, Other Than Audio Quality, It's A Hella Lot Better and Offers More Robust Features Than Apple Music and Those Current Music Streaming Apps",1
"What is wrong with Spotify nowadays? It just stop playing music and the pause button disappears :/ i reinstalled the app seven times and restarted my phone, but unfortunatelly nothing changed.",0
Love this app every kind of music your looking for in one place.,1
Music keeps stopping out of nowhere and it's annoying,0
Good,1
Don't understand why it we can't turn off shuffle without premium. ðŸ§,0
It is the worst but the songs are good!Â¿,1
Latest update about allowing access to nearby Bluetooth devices makes app unuseable due to force closing constantly.,0
I have over 50 hours of songs on my playlist and it just recycles the same 50 songs over and over. Such a waste of money.,0
"Love it, it's everything you wa t to listen to muzic Great Appliation, nothing g @ this time to complain about. May be next time.",1
I enjoy Spotify because I can make my own playlist and listen to new music and new artists all at the same time,1
"Best app Highly recommended ðŸ‘ (edited)but recently this app is not working well, it just keep saying that no internet connection available even when the speed is of 1.0mb/s. This is kinda disappointing to me. So Spotify please fix this problem.",0
Bug where the song bar disappears was fixed last week but has since returned. Get your act together. Edit: completely unusable after the latest update. You literally have one product. Get it right.,0
if i hear one more suggested song in a playlist i made i swear i will lose my mind. Please stop i just want to listen to my favourite songs but all i hear is songs I don't know and don't like. I'm tired of using all of my skips just to skip the suggested songs,0
I'd give it 5 stars but I have random shows popping up on my menu (please add a remove button),0
"Love the app but your last update for android seems less stable. FYIðŸ™ This is an update. Your app seems to pause at random. It also seems, after casting video (say watching rogan) the title screen of what im watching freezes and stays on said video. Its driving me nuts. Im also having occasional problems listening to my downloaded content offline. Especially when there is the tiniest bit of service but not enough to do anything. Love to talk to someone about it...",0
I faced a problem at third time of not showing my liked songs list & other songs also not playing.,0
Literally use it every day Its amazing for listening to music and has all the music I want Very good app,1
Nice for background music it used to be in 5/3/21 now it's trash put it in the trash,0
Been with Spotify for 3 years work like a charm for me no problem great app just wish they had different premium it's only 11$ a month but still love it,1
Easy to use and affordable,1
Big L for spotify i was listening to mgr when i pressed the shuffle button some random indan music destroyed the vibe,0
"Not great, For the listener it'll randomly undownload all your albums, or if you go offline not load them at all. And this app shafts their actual creators by paying them fractions of pennies",0
Easy to use and good selection,1
I love it so much I can download a lot of music and enjoy as much as I can and the price is very affordable â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ˜©,1
Looses place and skips podcasts when adverts play. Every update i have to redo my settings to the way I want it to work. A literally rock from the ground is a better podcasting platform.,0
Wonderful collection of songs with convenience,1
The app used to be so good until recently. No snippets for songs that are recommended for your playlist. Artists albums are always shuffled with random songs from other artists. No options to see the songs in albums. Spotify would get 5 stars if issues like these are solved.,0
Very good app for people of all age group and excellent for senior citizen,1
I like it a lot. I pay for premium so no adds. I don't make playlists or do anything fancy. I put an album on and let it play then I pick another. I like that the app shows new music from artists you like. You have to click follow on the artist but it's no biggie. Plus it shows support for that artist. I like that it will show you concerts coming up from your followed artists. All that said for how I use it it is five stars.,1
"Since the last update for Android on Samsung Phones the controls had disappeared and you couldn't see what was playing, pause or stop it. Please have your Quality Assurance Department test the App before you post the latest Updates.",0
"I didn't like it because it didn't put my song on but, it put different song can you please fix thatðŸ˜ ",0
Used to work perfectly but now crashes a lot.. sometimes I can not even switch the music off and have to restart my phone.,0
Best Music App,1
Spotify premium is worth every penny!! Recently I've been facing a lot of bugs in Spotify please look into it asap,1
Fantastic music that I make better by listening to what sounds great to me!!,1
"Very good app, but please bring back song previews. It helps people know if the song will interest them or not.",1
App closes or songs freeze. Might have to cancel family plan.,0
Nice music I love FNF and you have it thank you so much,1
I have been using this app from very long time but suddenly it's not playing any song and showing all the playlists empty. Tried reinstalling it as well but nothing works still facing the same issue.,0
"From like 2 or 3 months, this app is not working well and whenever I try to listen any songs,podcast and episodes, it shows that go to home page ! And I'm requesting you to please fix this bug or glitch as soon as possible ðŸ™",0
"The app worked great, but once it updated for some reason when I select the song I want to play it does not work at all. I have to close the app multiple times even then it won't play the song. The songs won't load. Please fix.",0
Nonsense. I can deal with ads I know apps need to make money. Why is it playing video for podcast when I don't want it. I don't care how little data it might use it is my data. Podcast often freeze because it is either loading video or trying to keep insync with audio as well. . and now weven though I have it set to only play video on wifi it continues to play video when on cellular. FU Spotify,0
The app would be worth it if there was offline listening but there is not you need premium which is expensive and clearly the creaters do not care about poor people I do not recommend downloading unless you got a pocket full of cash and no life,0
"Ads are quite intrusive . Sometimes after watching a 30 second ad , when I shouldn't have to see another ad for half an hour , I get another ad after a few minutes, which should not be the case. The Equalizer should be made available in a more easily accessible menu instead of the settings , as I have to go back to the app home page, go to settings , scroll down and then click on the Equalizer option to access it , which is quite cumbersome and unnecessary .",0
At first this app was good but after that you can't even select the songs you want to hear and they fill your playlist with song that annoy you or you don't wanna hear so pls do not download it if you want a clean and enjoying music time,0
This app is pretty cool its cheaper money wise then other apps I've used before. And they gave me a three month free trial. Definitely thinking about keeping the app for years to come,1
This new update sucks i cant repet songs and its so hard i cant find the song i wanted i find it but there is more then one song i dont see any playlist the songs become more then one song its so hard please make it easier,0
Fix the disappearing play tools when you connect Bluetooth,0
Very good listening to my fav.music 5 ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ,1
The app was so easy to use and the selection of songs fit my taste in music I recommend it to anyone looking for the songs of your choice,1
4 stars cuz I can't share the song file w/ my friends,0
"I really love Spotify, the downside is that every few songs there is 1-3 ads. I wish to have the same features as I would have on computer/laptop/pc where I can loop a certain song and move the slider to adjust what time of the song I want to play. Very good app in general, 9.5/10 recommend!",1
"App not thought through: Tried accessing my downloaded podcasts, because I was in a place without mobile connectivity. I couldn't, because.... drumroll... there was no internet connection! When do you think people would want to access their DOWNLOADED podcasts most? Probably when there is no internet connection! Edit: It just dawned on me: I need to pay to enjoy offline content. Just think about it: I need to pay to enjoy the content that is distributed by its creators for free. Disappointing!",0
Enjoyed it more before they had podcasts. Now all they're pushing podcast recommendations more than music.,1
Free version has more ads than driving through Las Vegas. Ad time and music listening time are almost 40/60 sometimes.,0
"Limits of skipping song is worst, and very hard to find even common songs",0
i love this app the music i can find is the best app i had use,1
Constantly displays a song that's not playing and sometimes starts playing on it's own.,0
The free is reasonable but not too much choice in what plays.also why does spotify keep popping up everytime i go to google playstore,0
"Been using Spotify for years but with a Samsung S22 you can't see the play bar, it doesn't connect to other devices without issues. Glitchy and rubbish. I've been paying this service for years but if things aren't improved, I'm out.",0
I love to sing so I love this decause there are not a lot of adds and you can listen to music and not be interpreted and listen to any song the song you love.,0
"I love it. Just the algorithm doesn't really work well for me. I get very weird recommendations like church songs, rocks that are not my type and podcasts that I'd never listen to, but not all the time. I got some very goodie goldie song recommendations too.",0
Good app,1
Easy to use. Has everything I need in terms of music and podcasts.,0
Great user interface but sound quality is appalling,0
Keeps playing songs unralated to my playlist . Doesnt respect selection and favorites,0
The app has been glitching and randomly pausing for over a month now. I have reported it with no response or helpful feedback. Please have your next update fix the current issues. People are paying for this service. Update 4/7/22: Still has horrible glitches I have to restart my phone or uninstall the app for it to work properly.,0
"This app only works properly about 70% of the time. Even when all my other apps load, Spotify will not. Furthermore, it won't load songs I've downloaded when I'm offline which totally defeats the purpose of downloading songs in the first place. I first thought it was my phone, but I just got the s22 and it is STILL not working properly. Pure trash. Don't waste your money on this service.",0
Great tunes and selection,1
It is by far the best free music app I've ever used. I recommend it to everyone. They have every song and artist you can think of. Great job to the developers of Spotify. 5 stars and more if I could give you guys 10 stars I would.,1
Now a time so many ads are coming plz reduce the ads. Because we r all hearing the song we enter in the depth of hearts so reduce the ads. When I comment like this after ads will come more.,0
They just need to do that make songs playable but some are not playable.,0
why i cant update my premium mini? its keep on saying unable to connect while my internet connection is great please solve this.,0
"Listen to 16 advertisements before a single song from my selection played. Sell out trash, you want me to pay, make a better product.",0
Tighten up. App crashes out of nowhere for the past month. Please fix. I dropped tidal for yall cuz of the same problems SMH,0
The new update sucks!!! Songs randomly stop for no reason. FIX THIS!!!!,0
"good app, too many ads. had it for 2+ years. you listen to 2 or 3 songs and get 4 ads. imo its too much",0
Its is a nice app but we need to pay money to listen we are poor what we can do,0
"New issue has occurred! Now I can't use any other app while Spotify is on. Why? Let me tell you! The sound goes off whenever I turn to another app! I will be looking for a better app if it doesn't change this week. Also heard that your company will be listening in the users to play ""the right music for the mood"" if that's true then count me out!",0
I really love that I get all the music and pod cast I want to hear.,1
"The content is outstanding. Any music i've searched for I've found no matter how obscure. Random shuffle of liked songs, on an over 500 song play list does play some songs much more often than others. Only flaw I've noticed.",1
"I love Spotify, they have all the music I love. Although I don't like how the option to turn off explicit content, but either than that I enjoy it. 10/10",1
Even when I have premium I don't get premium features,0
"Most recent update has ruined the app. When I play a song, the progress bar doesn't show so no control over songs, music stops randomly now and the shuffle algorithm is terrible, always adds the same songs you've listened to at the top of the list. It's honestly deterring me from continuing to use Spotify.",0
"Its great, i would give it a full 5..only if there weren't so many interruptions and ads. You literally get ads after every 2 songs which is REALLY annoying. And not just one ad, i get 2 or more ads after one or 2 songs. Please reduce them, because the more this continues, the more people are gonna dislike spotify.",0
Awesome app. Worked during travel abroad,1
"The songs are annoying asf, I can't even listen to ads bcs of these stupid songs. 2/5 star. Shame on you Spotify.",0
Easy to use. Plenty of material to choose from.,1
"Spotify is great and that doesn't need saying, but i can't give it a good review until they give the middle east region the podcasts too. 2 stars is all it gets",0
New update has problems with pausing and continuing play,0
I had this app for 3 years and today I can't login and I used it everyday I have gone through a lot and music is the only thing that kept me going no I feel very scared,0
I really like it but there's some ads I dislike ðŸ˜‘,0
A great app to listen to your favourite music !!!,1
I use it daily. I don't catch any problems.,0
"Sometimes I play chill music for my dog when I'm out, now Spotify thinks I'm all about that dog music life. Would be nice to have an option to exclude certain playlists from ""my favourite"" music and future suggestions",0
Spotify is the best thing since sliced ðŸž,1
"Great app! Has the sickest jamz & tunez. Brings me to a better mood with my energy booster playlist ND then brings me down, when I'm in my feelings",0
Actually this app deserves 5 stars but I give it 4... Coz there are some music which are unplayable... Don't know what's the reason behind it... But it's a kind request to avail them ASAP....,0
Great content! Drops out sometimes or turns off for unknown reason.. but great free app!,1
"Thank you Spotify for offering music and talk shows important to me and my family, but hard to find anywhere else. Music Box Christmas, the Original Cats London version, Kenny Rankin, Joe Rogan and more. Spotify is clearly the best music option!",1
"I left Spotify for about 2 months to try Amazon music. Worst app for music and now back using Spotify again. Doesn't crash, doesn't pause for laooding each song streaming, doesn't require restarts multiple times.",0
"Good,but advertisement more",1
"Can't believe you need to BUY premium, which I have, to best experience it.",0
"crashes and pauses all the time. function buttons disappear in the middle of playing so I cannot play/pause, stop, track, etc. I update, uninstall, logout of all devices, follow all advice I find on different forums and still...",0
Group sessions don't work at l All,0
Once anything has been downloaded the app slows to a crawl and becomes nigh unusable after a while.,0
"Lately the free version is unusable, two adds after every two songs. I am not going too buy that stuff anyway, and yes, they are the same two adds every time.",0
Fix this dumb music app It has been 1 hour and it wouldn't let me skip,1
Great Music! Great Access!,1
Too much ads without any reason!!!,0
Great app. Easy to use. I love the interface for podcasts!,1
"On this versin offline playing problem, always says no network and stops playing . Cannot olay dowloaded podcasts. All podcasts are on same folder, needs to be devided. Locked screen playing panel has gone.",0
To me I think this app is fantastic! I don't really see anything wrong with it. The only thing it lags just a little. Other than that.. this app is amazing! I love how u can play songs when I'm on a different app. I am IN LOVEEEE!,1
Best way to have the music always with you,1
"Linkable to many services and devices. Selections somewhat diverse. Convenient w/ offline DL's (paid)ã€ŠBUTã€‹Poor shuffle randomizer. Wasteful efforts on useless features, IE: Strange Things mode. I mean really? A feature only experienced on a single page? I mean, who watches the screen whILE LISTENING? even MTV learned that years ago. But the penultimate reason I can't give above 3 is they don't pay artist's a fair share of THE profits. SO Much so that many musicians boycott Spotify.",0
This is a great app! I love it and I also really like the fact that we can buy premium and use it for 3 months and cancel anytime if we don't want to pay lol but this is amazing!,1
I've tried other Platforms and Spotify is hands-down the best,1
"Worst app I've ever used. Constantly crashes, alwayd has connection problems even when on 4g and all other apps work fine",0
I'm on my last nerve with Spotify I hope Spotify goes to hell ðŸ˜,0
It is fun and relaxing to stay on spotify,1
"Uses up too much storage space, Ad pops up every 10 mins, it's getting annoying",0
"Absolutely awesome app! I've been listening to my liked songs for so long. Spotify doesn't even have a lot of adds. I honestly give the app five stars. â­â­â­â­â­ Edit: this app is great, but I can't play a specific song without having to use my skips, (which are 6 for free listeners) so I took 1 star off. Please fix this",0
Works well. Just needs to pay artists a bit more,0
The best music app I have ever used in my life Offers great sound quality ðŸ”¥,1
One n only requirement is option to download songs for free,0
Getting worst each time I open the app. Music/Artists I listen to are slowly getting removed. Features such as autoplay hardly ever work. Shuffle only ever does shuffle that same few songs IN A PLAYLIST OF A HUNDRED SONGS. I wonder what's next.,0
In my opinion spotify beats all of the music apps out there hands down.........,1
"Too many adds and more emphasis on buying premium , podcast Don't have adds soo good",0
"Love the app generally, but now the app logged me out and i cant log back in. It keeps loading and nothing happens.",0
Kinda sucks without premium but I guess that's how all things work in the world now,0
"I formerly rated this app 5 stars, but now I have more glitches than ever using Android. My album art won't load properly, which is VERY ANNOYING. Also, sometimes when holding down on a song to bring up the options menu, that includes adding to playlist or adding to queue, it just stops working. You can hold down on the song for an hour and it still won't being up that menu. Shuffle mode somehow changes without me doing it...",0
"What happened with spotify these days? Updates just kept coming. The more you update the more it gets really bad. It just doesn't work well. Online or offline, it takes years for it to open. Can someone fix this? Like really fix it? We don't pay premium for nothing, you knowðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸",0
Good,1
"great app but ads more...sometime not getting searching song, many troubles this software it hard to login this app and many many problem, would you stop this company go to eat butter chicken",0
Spotify..... Kinda sucks. that's it here's why you can't look up specific songs. and when you do you get a playlist named after that song. Runes the app,0
"Latest update broke Bluetooth car controls, and also the app itself no longer registers that music is playing when it is",0
"This is horrible, i loved using spotify and now for almost 2 years, i've tried MULTIPLE times to download spotify, i can only download spotify lite, but i had better experience with spotify, yet it won't let me download it. This used to be my favorite platform to listen to music but now it's not worth it. :(",0
Just migrated fully off of siriusxm. Not looking back. Never had so much fun just recalling songs out of the blue or checking out nrw music I come across on sm. News podcasts fill in gaps well.,0
It stopped playing after a while but comes back later by itself,0
Why is it that certain songs aint on here but on apple music smh,0
Used to work flawlessly. Under android 12 the problems are too numerous to mention.,0
Love that Spotify doesn't shut down the freedom to express different views. And doesn't cave to 'celebrities'.,1
"Too many ads. Watching a single video for 30 minutes no ads is a scam because you still get two more ads right after, then it plays one song and then three more ads. Ads ads ads.",0
"Even when I'm paying for it I still get pop up ads. Frick off Also, the tv app is truly terrible. No playback speed control, overly simplified UI, reduced options to choose in the home page, almost no ability to look at previously played, search function is clumsy. Seems designed at showing you their recommendations and the most popular/highest paying of your recent listens, but not chronologically. Garbage design for users, I'm about to quit. Winamp 25 years ago had better functionallity.",0
I love this app it has amazing songs and all the songs I love,1
"The amount of advertising has exploded. This is a great app if you want to listen to two songs, followed by three ads. I am looking for another option, because Spotify has definitely declined recently.",0
"I've been using Spotify for four years now but only recently started using the app. The expirience is mostly the same, very user friendly and easy to navigate. Would recommend to anyone.",0
One of the best Music Streaming/Player. It could be 5* if has family feature in VN,1
"Love it!! (4/30/22) Keeps crashing and everything I've tried to fix it, hasnt. Seems to be crashing on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectionws. (11-12-21) amazing! Still amazing!! (4-18-20)",1
"Best music streaming platform out there, been a satisfied customer for years now.",1
"Tried playing some tunes and found they're only previews for a few by seconds. Rated it five before now down to one. Took ages to play Midnight Star's Scientific Love instead played differing tunes but labelled it the aforementioned tune. I finally got it to play liked it added it to my playlist to find it only plays previews now since we I updated the app. What a waste of time, I can play I it on YouTube without the app.ðŸ¤¬",0
Have only been using it for a month and I have to say it has been a lovely experience,1
"A wide selection of music, great recommendations, and worthy of any person who just wants to create a Playlist of their favorite songs.",1
i love this app so much,1
It's the best app for songss I just love it .. if u have never tried it try it noww,1
The app is great. No faults mostly. The liked songs and the song bar at the bottom disappears sometimes. But otherwise its a great experience :),1
I'm paying for an app that doesn't show the now playing controls. I love this app but this has been frustrating. Please fix!!!,0
Web player is much better. This app is pretty much useless if you don't have Spotify Premium.,0
"The update from 2 weeks ago broke the app. Now, if I disconnect a Bluetooth device (like when I turn off my car) and then turn it back on, Spotify tries to play but no longer shows which song is playing so I can't pause or skip. Have to hard exit and restart the app to get it to work again. Also, they're completely unresponsive to bug reports, and to requests like for the ability to ""thumbs down"" a song that you don't like that keeps coming up in radio mixes.",0
"Spotify is a good app, don't get me wrong but the things wrong with it are very apparent I turned off auto play so only the music in my playlists get played and Spotify still plays music outside of them, I even hidden them from said playlist and it doesn't he get hidden. Not only that but sometimes Spotify doesn't play a song all the way through, or it stops in the middle of the song so I have to skip it. It's really frustrating and stupid. Live laugh love Spotify tho, just wish these were fixed",0
I rate this a 1 because I can even tap on the song and play it. When I press it it plays a 5 second part that in the song so fix it or imma delete it got today to do it or it's gone.,0
Chill playlist is awesome,1
With me I try to play a song on my play list like demons it will play radioactive so its super annoying.,0
it is great you get almost free skips i defintetly recomend this app.,0
Best app best audio sound free all songs,1
"why cant we listen to some music when adding songs, soo annoying n disappointing",0
I absolutely love this app have paid for a subscription since I was 15. I'm only giving it a 4 star review because I wish you could add a song to multiple playlists at once.,1
"This app has so manu bugs! All I tried was to change the place to storage my music and has been 3 days since I can't use my Spotify account properly. 5 bugs till now, and my solution will be uninstall and install the app again, so then I have to download my whole album again! I Hate this!",0
"I like having the music that my husband and I love, country music and gospel.",1
Honestly been using Spotify for a while now. but lately it's like 5 to 6 adds in a go. I get you need adds but we use the app for music not adds about overpriced makeup and fancy cars or perfume. I'm trying to vibe and just chill to music not 5 adds,0
"A lot of music, of various kinds, what more can you say.",1
Your app is so trash dude win I try to get a song up it just play another song this is trashl,0
"Best app. Nice for downloading music, has all the features you need. So if your wondering is it the bestðŸ¤”. Yes it is",1
"If you want people to pay for your app/services, fine, but pay artists for their Data, give them their real cut intead of pieces of pennies you make millions off of, otherwise make the service free with no ads, it's only right and you know it. *Wishful thinking*",0
Great music selection,1
I like Spotify a lot I just wish they would do a better job buffering the volume of the music so that my playlists aren't all over the place. Otherwise I'm very happy.,1
"I love this app it's just that it's annoying you can't get off of shuffle playlist on mobile or rewind the song. And that you put indie music labled as ""dsmp music"" like what. Your on thin ice right now spotify.",0
It's great to find music u like even though the ads are disturbing your mood ðŸ™‚,1
Smart and easy to use ðŸ˜‰,1
I love the app but I hate that they add random songs it is sooooo annoying.,0
the app on my phone doesn't work anymore after the recent update. it says my playlists are empty and i can't play any music or podcasts at all. it works fine on my laptop though. i pay premium and i can't use the app anymore.... coooooool fun i love it >:C fix it asap,0
an excellent app in my opinion I didn't find any fault in it,1
I love it,1
"The past month, most of the time there is not a play bar, so it only plays for like 10 minutes then suddenly stops. I have to uninstall then reinstall every time i pause the podcast for this reason. This is extremely annoying.",0
Still learning to navigate the programming. Guess I have to go to Premium because the commercials are annoying,0
Best thing ever was your company coming to all who wanted all the music. movies you could ever want .thank you.,1
How long will it take to fix the payment option. Being on the free plan is not a nice experience. I want to get back on Premium but its failed now for the 2nd month.,0
"So many adds and 6 skips an hour, really?",0
This is the best music app ever,1
Amzing jop drapo,1
"App crashes, now playing disappears and I'm paying for this!",0
"Edit: Since they brought back car mode I've raised my rating to 4 stars but there's still some weird bugs like being unable to access my playlists but music still plays and everything on the home page is fine. Old: So, let me get this straight, you removed the perfectly fine car mode - which despite the name actually had plenty of uses outside of a car - and replaced it with a mode that can only be used with the ""car thing"" - which is currently only available in the USA and costs a cool $80???",0
"Love it , it plays the music I love.",1
Pretty good app. Even the free version of this has less ads than you tube music.,1
Good library to choose from.,1
App is nice music play and first working.,1
"I listen to music daily on this app. I understand you put ads money are good thats not the problem it doesn't bother me. The problem is playing suggested songs randomly and not my playlist. It's super annoying, I turned the autoplay setting off and it still does it. Extremely disappointed",0
It has too many ads and you only get 6 skips per hour and it adds songs to your playlist.,0
The library of music is infinite.,0
The songs keep stopping and starting even when I have them downloaded. I have Spotify premium and the songs stop and start.,0
Waste of time. There are so many free music player apps that come with equalizers and many other options. And even YouTube is better for discovering new music. NOT recommended.,0
I like spotify but i hate that i can't just play my entire library without having to add songs to a playlist or like all songs. Can you just create a shuffle button to play all songs in a person's library?,0
"Nice app, But it contains too much ads.",0
"Considering stopping my subscription due to the quality of this app. I shouldn't have to restart the app/my phone multiple times a day because the app just decides not to play music, the one thing it's supposed to do. 2 years later and I still have this issue daily. Ridiculous",0
I absolutely love Spotify! I get to listen to all my favorite songs whenever I want!! I have premium and it is just amazing,1
Why the hell did you get rid of the Related Artists feature? It was a brilliant way of discovering new artists on the platform and someone had the bright idea to rid of it. Do the right thing and bring it back.,1
Its a great feel to listen to it,1
"I love it even without a subscription it plays perfectly there are adverts inbetween just that there isn't a wide variety to choose from , you'll sometimes find the same song in almost all the suggested playlists but other than that love it",1
It's good because it is nationwide music app for listening but I hate that I can't become a premium membership because I am in highschool and I don't have money or ATM to pay in Spotify so that is the problem and of course the ads because I am not in premium and when you want to change the music it can't cause it has a limited time only at 30min or you can't change cause only 3 song's only so that's my feedback.HAVE. A GOOD ðŸ˜Š DAY,0
Excellent,1
BMW iDrive 6 integration is completely broken. We pay for Spotify but gets poor support. Seems iTunes works flawlessly with BMW.,0
"This update is making my ocd go nuts by moving the play button. Really not impressed. Why did it move? Also. I hate how it never tells me what was actually in the update. I'd like to know what goes on with a service I pay for. "" Always Making improvements"" my a$$.",0
Very hard to use compared to other platforms,0
"This is my favorite app when it comes to listening music, but recently, whenever i press the play button, spotify automatically stops and back to homescreen. Please fix it!",0
"Good app after all, but it's not. Playing suggested songs instead of the songs we want to listen to is annoying. I won't waste my money on premium for playing my own songs because I want to have money and not be broke. You guys are just trying to make money like that so we can stop complaining. Nice try. Won't get my money. I won't ever trust premium. Plus not everyone has money to afford premium whether it's expensive it cheap for them. So what will they do? Nothing.",0
A whole amazing world of music and blogs has just opened up for me. It's awesome,1
Love this app I've used it for a year or two now. Lately though the last few months it seems there is way more ads than before to the point where I almost never use it on my phone now. The lack of music choice and five ads or more every three songs or so makes it very unworth the time wasted unfortunately. I mostly listen on my console now because though there are ads at least I can choose what to listen too.,0
"Since the latest update spotify no longer connects to my car stereo, had no problems up until then, phone is connected but tells me there is no device through Spotify.",0
Too bad after the new update can not listen to the song I want to plus I even lost my old account I can not log in my old account i have to make a new one,0
I love being able to listen to my favorites.,1
"Simple to use, rich content, diverse authors",1
I like music and this provides a plethora.,1
"The fact that u can listen to your downloaded tracks in the Spotify app is very ery nice feature, i love it. Thank you Spotify! Best update ever!",1
"I think Spotify developers are not focusing on major issues of users, so many of us can't play the song no music sound coming sound is an big issue from ur app especially.",0
Almost each and every song I can think of is here.,1
"everytime I opened music that I want , it's will changed to recommend song that I don't like, and I can't even skip",1
"App not working on Airtel fiber , have to turn on mobile data",0
Recent updates have made this really laggy and full of bugs which make the app crash every 30 seconds. Seriously considering stopping my premium subscription because this has become so unusable.,0
"Spotify picks random times to update what I assume are my downloaded playlists every day, but it keeps getting stuck at 95-97% unless I manually open and then force close the app. Update: been over a month and still no fix. Dropping down to one star.",0
"Music playback is broken on android and has been for ~3 weeks. Seem incapable of rolling back the issue, probably because they've been trying to push ""Video Podcasting"" into the app. Has been my go-to music app for ~5 years, but it isn't usable for more than half an album worth of tracks at a time, so unsubbed until they get the audio player working. Googling ""Now Playing bar missing on Android"" and you'll see more than 70 pages (at the time of writing) of people with this issue - Spotify seemingly remain silent after their initial ""fix"" didn't fix it.",0
"I downloaded my playlist to play it offline while im traveling, but the app doesnt allow due to i need internet connectio. I dont find the logic of the download button anymore.",0
I gave u only 1 star cos am unable to use my debit card to subscribe to premium from nigeria . this whole thing is frustrating,0
"The newest update is horrendous. Multiple times a day I'll go to play a song and it just doesn't show up at the bottom meaning I can see the next/previous song and can't rearrange the queue on shuffle. Please go back to how it used to look it was so much better. Tired of closing and opening the app just because I want to change the playlist I'm listening to. What happened to ""if it's not broke don't fix it""? I've had this app for 5 years and premium for 4. I really don't want to have to delete.",0
"Using a Galaxy A50 android phone and a Premium subscriber. Phone just upgraded its firmware a few days ago and now Spotify app doesn't work. I can get everything from my account on the website but app is haywire. I've tried reinstall, clean reinstall and everything else listed...nothing. I can't get anyone from Spotify to help. Not happy.",0
"No swipe to queue. Automatically changes your lockscreen background to a awful low res version of the album cover which sucks especially hard if said album cover is NSFW. There is no way to turn that off except for disabling all notifications, which includes the play/pause thing in the control center. Freezes surprisingly often. Looking at the suggestions forums, even stuff that has been constant suggestions for years (like swipe to queue) are ignored. Lots of music on here though.",0
"Since I first started suing Spotify at the turn of 2021, I have actually been flabbergasted at the range and variety of music that is on here; there is literally nothing that I can think of that I lhave not been able to find boatload's of, it really is mind blowing; I have enough to listen to 24/7, and that for me is a big deal. I rate Spotify as worth every pound/dollar, or Euro, and then some. Angelo GB.",0
Spotify is amazing. I use it to listen to all my music. There is occasionally an add of only 30 seconds every 1 and a half hour so not bad!! Over all really great app,1
Good app. There are Some bugs and stuff but overall It's good,1
Now ads bad app,0
"After recent update, I cannot play any music in spotify from my phone Vivo V21e. Its auto crash and close. I can play using webplayer in my phone browser or playing from pc. So obviously my account is not the problem but the app. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP OR I'M NOT GOING TO RENEW SUBSCRIPTION. Wil delete this review only after things become better",0
Its a very good musical app i have learn so much about good music,1
I can play the songs while gaming,1
This is primium subscription apps but the sound clarity is worst. Payed apps must be contain official songs and music but seems dissapoiment. Also collection of tamil song is really fewer. Sometimes got songs but cant play. India cenema movie sing best than album but seems they release audio also. Please la keep up to date most of tamil song not in the list. We payed so you give payed services not a free services.,0
Music discovery algorithm sucks. Super pushy with podcasts. Ads for concerts and other stuff even though I pay for premium. Pandora has a much much better algorithm IMHO.,0
"I'm absolutely satisfied with spotify. Furthermore, you are able to find original version of musics with their original cover as well. ðŸ˜Š",1
Latest version breaks Spotify app on Pioneer car stereo head unit. Will connect with bluetooth audio selected as the source and Android Auto but not the Spotify app.,0
With the new update I've noticed that my crossfade isn't working anymore. The option to crossfade is disabled. Is this now a premium thing?,0
Tracks are well organized.,1
"I don't know if it's with the new upgrade, it's being stopping while playing and won't play for fee seconds both on mobile and on TV...pls fix this as I can't pay for premium and still go through this",0
"I've had spotify premium for a few years now but I will be cancelling it as the app is no longer user friendly. It constantly pauses, crashes, I can't pause music when I need to as the function has disappeared. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and then restarting my phone but it's not making a difference and it looks like I'm not the only one experiencing issues. Disappointing, to be honest, but I will have to find an alternative to stream music.",0
Ever since they introduced lyrics on Spotify I have never gotten it someone help me,0
That one thing you didn't know you would be lost some kind of way without. Music for the soul child in me feel found.,1
"I Hope you add some more perks on Premium Mini like add more songs to download because 30 songs are not enough, Thank You",0
"Initial impressions were great. No ads although I would not have minded. Spotify made accurate recommendations and I created a Playlist. I could cue songs and see the whole playlist to select songs. Back online a few days later and the functionality is suddenly limited...even skipping tracks is now a premium feature. So, you're sucked in with free features that just disappear and become premium. Misleading or what?",0
The only problem is we can't download the playlist,0
"I only gave 4 stars cuz there still are some songs and bands I can't find here...but still, it's among one of my favorite apps.ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤",1
Nice app but can be really annoying on mobile consideringthe fact that you can't arrange or change the order of how the songs play in a playlist so you just have to listen to whatever song it chooses to have first,0
I used this for few days and it was fine but suddenly it got issues. I can't play full songs. When ever i tried to play songs it just played a 10 sec short version of the song. Why is it happening??? Plz ans me? Why i can't hear the full song??,0
Was working perfectly until these new updates. I have to make Playlist for any genre now if I want to listen to just country or whatever while at work. The song genre tabs are useless now. Version 8.7.28.1217 did nothing but go backwards to me. Guess I just have podcast to depend on atleast.,0
"My Spotify is not working as well like it was from the first.. it's taking a lot of time to open the app, to start any music and also sometimes it's not showing the music which is playing.. help plss",0
"Well honestly speaking I like the last version more than the new one, you simply can't play a playlist without songs you didn't want to play,popping up,you simply can't play your favorite song because a song that you didn't want to play will then play honestly I don't know what happed Liked the old version more even thou the new version has some cool stuff itheres still some hiccups on it",1
wowwwwwww one of the best audio play music platform i love it. awesome.,1
"Nice, got my lyrics. Thanks",1
"Worst music application out there! DO NOT INSTALL, DO NOT USE!",0
Excellent way that I can select my favorite musics and then can select my favorites to be played of the composition that I elect them to be played from,1
best app for listening songs,1
"Best, most advanced music platform for sure, it's just the way to go and super pleasing to look at, use, works with everything, Spotify ftw",1
i love it the only thing i would fix is spotify emailing me about there preuim... Otherwise it is AWSEOME i think it is awseome cuz all the songs are FREE :) if u are thinking of getting spotify plzzzzz follow me at _Isabelle_Sandler_ Thxssss,0
"One of the most flawed apps out there, considering only the big and famous ones. I have problems that where addressed 5+ years ago. (after restart the downloaded files get deleted and internal storage is active again. Stops after 10min of playing. Restart in offline mode bricks the app. These are only the big ones, smaller ui decisions I don't even count) Are the devs even doing anything, or are they only doing artists contracts?",0
"Great app me and my dad are using a premium duo plan, only issue I have is some songs I listen to get removed randomly.",0
"I love Spotify and the app is so Good. I do have premium so IDK how the experience is without it. Only thing that would be cool, if we could download lyrics...",1
Awesome to say the least. I can listen to Joe Rogan as I clean the house or some comedian. The more I explore Spotify the more interesting it becomes.,1
Love how every song I like.,1
"Love the music, love the compilations collected based on my taste in music",1
I would give it all stars if THIS NEW UPDATE WAS GOOD. I hate the new update in which the songs are randomized and i cant just choose them like the pervious update and all the albums in my library. I just hate the new update of the app. P.S make a option to choose randomized or normal please,0
I loveee Spotify but the new update is ruining my experience and Its hard to find songs in playlist. Also Spotify automatically added songs in my own playlist which I didn't like so I hope they fix it,0
Love this app and recommend it to all. Fabulous . ðŸ¥°,1
The app is wonderful. Maybe you can add a feature repeating the whole playlist,1
What's point in disabling songs from platform even after we're listening more advertisements than songs. Just forcing to go for premium. Too cheap marketing.,0
Says I am offline but I am not. It doesn't work anymore,0
"spotify is a great listening app. the only problem is that for you to have the best experience is you have to buy premium. though i dont have any problem with buying something but for some, they do. ive also been having problems updating my app. ive been having troubles updating my spotify since 2020. please do fix this ðŸ¥²",0
"NOT LOADING OR NOT PLAYING ANYTHING AS OF 8 HOURS AGO!! Very upset, used daily AND I paid $9.99 for premium!!! Irritated and want my music back. Will be contacting support asap, if fixed and am satisfied with customer support I will rate 5 stars and update review",0
If you want to listen to it and but it gives you 30 minutes of free listening and it will give you six skips just skip this song per hour and go to use them wisely but again a very good app,1
"Got logged out of my account that still has premium and I don't know what email I used. Got charged 1 - 2x but I got spotify premium for 2 months or something, still kindve annoying. Still have me free premium with the same card.",0
Very poor integration with driving mode. Consistently plays random and erroneous songs when trying to make a selection using the voice assistant. Spotify pauses the assistant in driving mode when it's narrating outside of Maps. Issues reported time and time again. No fix in sight.,0
"I hate the numbers of advertisements. Spotify should be like YT MUSIC, plays only one ads at a time. Unlike spotify too many ads",0
Great music keep it up,1
"It's all good but , when we watch ads it say say that "" You will get 30 min of uninterrupted music "" but after 4-5 min the ad will start again ..... Fix this problem as soon as possible Otherwise All thing is good",0
Fantastic music everything that I like no matter what era they have everything I need .,1
I have used Spotify for years its amazing and they have every song! Even from musicals and TV shows. I bought premium which is just Â£5 a month I think. You can download music to listen ofline and will still play if your phone is off or on another app. ðŸ‘ðŸ˜,1
I love this and playlist and everday I listen kpop playlist this is so good,1
Adds prblm,1
"I like a lot Spotify. Huge selection of music that's what I love it. Music brings me joy, I feel relax and calm. That's what I need.",1
"I love listening to Spotify while cooking, cleaning, working out, or to help the kids sleep, but recently, the play bar missing with no way to access the play screen to connect to Alexa, skip or pause. A quick uninstall/reinstall fixes the issue, but is INCREDIBLY inconvenient. Google searches state this has been a known issue for Android users and that it has been fixed, but clearly not as I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times. App is buggy, service has a wide variety for the family",0
"I'm having a trouble listening to music lately Spotify is shutting down on its own whenever I press play button,i tried everything from uninstalling the app to trying various methods to get rid of this bug . My app is also updated .I even tried few times logging out of my account and logging back in (I even tried to make a new account) but i just can't listen to music anymore pls let me know if there's any other way of getting rid of this problem. Thank you ðŸ˜Š.",0
"very nice app, however I don't know if it's just my phone but it will randomly stop playing music and pretty much refresh the app if I'm on a different app/game with spotify music playing which is really annoying and leaves me to have to go continuously back and forth from app to app to get the music to continue playing.",0
To many adds but other wise very good,1
It work fine tge first couple minutes thin it would play random songs and thw songs I clicked on it would play 10 second previews and not work.,0
"Someone already mentioned it but I'd like to say it as well, the dots thing at the right side of the searched song seems to be removed, it was very easy to add songs in playlist that way but now u have to play them before adding, not very important but just wish it wasn't removedâ€¢Ì â€¿ ,â€¢Ì€",0
Not working with Google assistant. Been using it from a long time but recently stoped working with Google assistant.,0
"I don't mind the ads appearing too often, but I don't like the automatic selection of the background colors for your own playlists or profile. Sometimes it picks the right color; sometimes it's just plain gray. Perhaps there should be an option to customize our profile and playlist background colors?",0
"It has been quite eventful, it has an efficient algorithm.",1
"Really great music streaming app, but it's unclear what qualifies as explicit in some cases",0
Shiva royal king,1
"edit: still can't preview songs, the queue is still messed up, plus the android widget isn't working after the last update and the link to make collaborative playlist just sends you to the main page",0
Worst music and podcast app available Edit: 6/30/2022 (over a year later) This app accrossed all my devices is still absolutely horrible. If I rewind a podcast more than 15 seconds it goes into a buffering loop that never ends. On occasion if I get ads on a podcast it restarts any podcast I'm listening to then makes me listen to adds again at a random spot in the podcast. HIRE SOME ACTUAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS,0
I like this app but the ads came CONTINUESILY,0
"Amazing app....but still far from perfect. Many songs in regional languages are not available, improvement is needed in that regard.",0
everything was ok before you decided to open a local office in Russia. Consider closing it if you want to have 5 stars for the app.,1
The best site with no ads,1
Honestly i dont like leaving bad reviews on apps but this one is just not it it took two whole day to finish downloading its so annoying the pause/play bar dissapears and music constantly lagging ive personaly only been using this app for about two and a half hours but most of it has been trying to figure out how to pause it lol i do not recommend this app at all sorry creaters im really hate to write this because i feel like they worked hard on this but in the end ill stick to youtubemusictryit,0
Honestly this app is awful. I'm trying to play my own music on my playlist and it keeps adding its own songs. I can't play my songs and it only provides shuffle play. Also when I click the song I want to play it only does the preview and I can't get to the whole song. Do not recommendðŸ‘Ž,0
"More commercials than music, this is no longer a music app...it's an add app! Your own greed will ruin you.",0
"Spotify has helped me uncover the sounds that I hear echoing on the top of my mind.. and it has helped me discover new sounds, adding to that echoing sound of my mind..âœ¨ðŸ‘ŒðŸ½",1
The game is very interesting so exciting but no net no songs that's why I am rating 4 stars if no net problem I rate 5 stars please reply to me,0
"the song I listened to is not finished, the outro/cover part is not there, I hope spotify can fix it because I like listening to the song until it runs out properly",0
No way to see all songs by an artist. I don't deal in albums so i have no clue where one song is in 20 albums. Wont be payong for premium again.,0
"Gives me a blank spotify logo on a black screen when i try to log in, and has been ""loading"" for over 20 minutes. im paying 11.99 a month for this?",0
Not sure what's happened but recently they seemed to have introduced lots of bugs. It just pauses when I play music and often wipes the play queue. Also on the iPhone app you can swipe to add to the queue but they haven't introduce this on the android app. Not sure why because it's such a good feature,0
"Great, easy to use, love it ðŸ˜€ ðŸ‘",1
It's amazing it has all the song u enjoy so what are u all doing downloade Spotify now!!!?!?!??!,1
Uninstalling Spotify. I am a doctor. Plenty of other streaming services who will actually support those working in healthcare.,1
This app is very good but I hope the developers can fix my issue or basically every app users issue whenever you play a song or a podcast the app stops running,1
Thank you for being ethical and considerate of your users. I like the app coz the commercials are noninvasive like YouTube. Plus the interface is nicely designed and suggestions are very relevant. Highly recommended ðŸ‘ Keep up the good job,1
Spotify is very good would not rate it 5 out of 5 4 is good,1
"When listening on my mobile device (OnePlus 8T+), the app will often cut out, requiring click resume to continue what I was listening to. Rather annoying.",0
It is a really good app I use it all the time when I am cleaning it is really good at keeping me calm as well,1
You guys are the bomb! I haven't tried a recording yet that you won't play. Thanks.,0
Good,1
Too many bugs/freezing,0
"There's such variety and available music that you can enjoy tremendous amounts of diversity, I love that. Old and new artists, it's wonderful. Music to relax, music to work out with, music to inspire, music to motivate! Spotify is fantastic! I like that I can share with my Husband too. I also like that wherever I utilize Spotify my playlists remain as I make them, cool...really happy with Spotify!",1
The recommendations are always for popular stuff no matter what you listen to. Worst recommendations of all time. There is little to no effort put into these. If you made a playlist exclusively with 90's Norwegian death metal this dumb app would trip over it's dick racing to suggest Island in the Sun by Weezer. The now playing bar only exists most of the time making it almost impossible to use without restarting your phone,0
"Pay for Spotify Premium, works fine 50% of the time and then others will show the songs as offline. Also downloaded podcasts are not available as soon as I go out of signal (ones which should be available offline). Not acceptable for such a premium subscription.",0
"Keeps pausing while playing music. Tried multiple solutions, nothing has worked. Definitely will be canceling my long time premium subscription because I can't stand how my music sounds like it's playing on a scratched CD. Ugh.",0
It's a wonderful app love it ..no problem at all ..and it's really nice coz you have all sorts of different genres of music ðŸŽ¶ to choose from so yeah well done ðŸ‘ Spotify.. great app and I will also recommend it to my family and friends ðŸ’“.cheers mate,1
For kannada songs lyrics should be in kannada..it can be useful..add kannada lyrics for all kannada songs..so many mistakes are there in English lyrics for kannada songs,0
Premium with bugs 2 thumbs up,1
Good but recurring issues with video podcasts having a blank screen,0
The app on Android is terrible add to that did many artists are leaving because Spotify finds it more important to support right wing commentators that use racial slurs and spread dis-information. I'm moving to another service and canceled my account.,0
Good great but only if there was the equalizer like in Apple so I can change the sound more efficiently but still good:: took me 2 years but I found the equalizer haha so 5* for me,1
"Take a long time to load. Stops automatically while playing. Also can't see the player tab, song plays in background only. Need to disconnect my credit card ASAP.",0
"I work with 4 music apps, each one has a few + and a few - items that come to mind. In a perfect world you'd think someone would bring the best options together to form a more perfect super music app.",1
I literally can't even open the app and I don't know why but I used it before. It's just the Spotify logo screen.,0
"There are too many repeated, unwanted ads and now there's rarely any 30 mins of uninterrupted listening. However, it's a good app for listening to music.",1
"Lot to love, but why does it have to download 800 songs again every time I open the app? I'm adding music to my offline cache, so what is it downloading every day?",0
"Jesus, I tried to play a song by Paul McCartney called new and it started playing some random song, like seriously do I have to pay for premium just to play a certain song???! I recommend YouTube music 100%..... don't even bother replying because I'm not getting this app, you guys really need to fix this... it's nonsense",0
Lately the app doeasn't show itself and I can't control it like pause or play or close it. Sometimes I restart the phone itself!,0
"So annoying with ad, i understand ad is ur revenue but atleast reduce it in app #disgusting",0
Best music app keep going and updating ðŸŽ¶,1
Good choice and variety. Can be a little tricky to find the song you looking for at times.,1
This is such an amazing app.. Absolutely convenient and easy to use with great features.âœ¨,1
This is truly the one stop place for all the music I need.!!,1
"Please stop pushing podcasts on me. I use your app for music, not stupid shock jock podcasts that you pay millions of dollars to support (and has-been ex UK royals). I wish you supported musicians to that extent. App is ok but the widget (only one available) is sub par. Please improve the aesthetics and provide more size configurations. The limited clunky widget makes this app less useful for me than I believe it should be for the amount I pay. Bring back Neil Young not covid misinformation!!",0
Really oowsome sound and good music ðŸŽ¼ contents.,1
Wish there was a way to your Playlist in order with out paying a lot of money. Something was wrong with the algorithm for awhile. Will give another try .,0
Spotify is Amazing,1
Every time i want to listen to my fave songs i can listen to a few but after like 5 songs it changes to a totally other song,0
My friend sent me a song called Big and Chunky I couldn't hear all of it's without downloading Spotify so I am downloading it right now,0
Just a waste of time and phone space..... Gaana is much more better........,0
I have been having alot of issues where even if the music is downloaded it will buffer. I have full bars and it still takes 7+ minutes to get through a 4 minute song,0
"Love this app you can listen to all of your favourite songs but there is alot of ads like I get 1 every 2 or 3 songs and they say, ""Watch this ad to get 30 minutes of free listening""",0
Thank for your help,1
"Nice to have a mostly easy app to use , save your music . Can't beat the price either",0
"Although a bother to buy prem, still no other music app scratches spotify",0
You cant preview songs anymore before adding them to playlists this is super annoying especially when you find out you added the wrong song,0
"Great app for the last 5 years. Lots has been improved upon but other things... (such as the totally unnecessary removal of the home screen widget for Android users as of 8/7) ..have been not so great. For anyone interested, Google ""Spotify widget removal"" and look for the most recent thread posted by the official Spotify team. Reading the comments there will give you an insight to just how asinine removing this feature was. I will add back two stars to this review once this feature is re-added.",0
I love music and i like the variety of music and songs arranged. I love to listen to all the podcasts,1
Ads are so irritating and frequent. One year of pain. Enough. Finally switched over to other music apps.,0
I love the music app and sometimes I listen to podcasts,1
"It keeps autoplaying random songs that aren't on my playlist, even with autoplay off, which probably means that turning autoplay off only actually works if you are using premium, which is a stupid decision.",0
Adds random songs to your own Playlist but it's an ok music app,1
Really loved for the offline option and then feature of app for both online and offline. It's really awesome ðŸ‘Œ,1
Pretty tight. For it's limitations. Keep brain storming the teck o library. Quary if you have continuous play,0
"It works only when you open it, it's getting hard to use.",0
"I hate this app so much. I installed it but I cannot sing up. Whenever I try, it shows ""something went wrong"". What hellacious is that!",0
Spotify allows me access to an increasing eclectic array of media. From great pod casts to banging tunes.,1
"I have been using Spotify from last 1 year, the sound quality is top notch. I can feel the music. I would definitely recommend Spotify to my friends. Thanks so much Spotify team for providing a best product.",1
Terrible if you commute on an underground subway. The UI and your library of downloaded and locally stored music cannot be played unless you manually switch the app into offline mode. The app should gracefully handle periodic outage of wifi/wireless connectivity and still function. Will likely be cancelling my subscription for this reason as Spotify is how I listen to music on my commute.,0
nice,1
Good,1
Song quality is good...but.the amount of ads is disgusting...it just straight up kills up the mood...everytime I tend to play a song Suddenly an ad comes on...omg...it's pathetic...pls fix it asap....overall...I have been Spotify over a year...and it's a really good app...excluding the horrible ad management...J gave u guys 3 stars next time episode fix those ad problems...and I will give all 5...,1
"Easy to use with an almost infinite music library plus extras, the best music and listening app I've ever used",1
"Good music variety, but songs repeat sometimes",1
"Spotify as a service is great, I have a paid account. I wish on the app you could see what your friends are listening to like when your on a PC. UPDATE: (2022) Not only is the above not fixed. Now when you share a link there is no preview anymore. I've searched the problem and there are tons of people complaining. Why have these great features and take them away, especially to people who pay for it?",1
The app stops everytime it is connected to my car's audio system via bluetooth..initially i thought it's the car..but it happened to my other cars too. have to delete app and reinstall ..then stops again ..,0
"Works excellently. Minimal issues and has virtually every song I want to listen to, even in obscure genres.",1
This is the first app. That I like the most. First I install gaana app but itbis error. So I uninstalled it and install Spotify. It is best.,0
"huge let down, went on several fligths, never managed to download music for offline listening, says no internet connection and no songs can be played.",0
Does anyone have to keep deleting and reinstalling this app? I do it at least once a week because the shuffle button keeps disappearing for my playlists! It's sooooo frustrating!,0
"I've been using it for years and the only problem I've ever encountered is that it crashes way too often, especially when I'm trying to click on a podcast episode.",0
"A deplorable excuse for an app. Multiple basic functions cease to work at a whim. Major desogn flaws...most notably the ""offline"" options which only function when you have connectivity.. and the DOWNLOADABLE content that consistently freezes when played.",0
Easy to use. Great song selection.,1
"I don't know what's wrong with it but my phone works just fine then I was trying to change songs but it won't let me cause I only get 6 skips per hour.. I mean, why does it even do that. And! Everytime I tried to click some songs for example: ""never be the same- by Camila Cabello"" it played another song like ""No lie- by Dua Lipa"" is this a bug?? If it is.. Fix it.",0
One of the best application for music . Love it â™¥ï¸,1
"I log in my account after 20-30 days and whenever I try to play any music it doesn't play and when I open any playlist it does say ""this is empty"" and never searches any songs",0
The player and widget in the Spotify app is now dissapearing (in app) or becoming unresponsive (widget) since updating. I am using a Samsung note 10+ 5g running UI 4.1 (latest OS),0
"Listen to what I want when I want. I get to make my own play list, I'm my own DJ. Saves me on long family trips as well ðŸ˜‰",1
Spotify makes it's so much harder to listen to my fav songs or playlist. The new update is just trush i wanna play song playlist in order but it's just automatically shuffles. Plus when i tried to listen to my playlist i hear songs i didn't even added. Spotify just wants your money at this point,0
I give it 4 cause it's good but the ads for premium is annoying and you cant download songs only with premium ita annoying but its good,1
A overall great up no ads and it's still free just a really great app,1
The sound is very clear.,1
Many ad and not connection to internet,0
Beat music app. Awesome sound qualities. And super Playlist ðŸ‘Œ,1
Newest update wont let me play my music and when i got to any playlist it shows up empty ive restarted and reinstalled the app and nothing. SPOTIFY FIX YOUR APP ... IVE BEEN PAYING PREMIUM FOR BROKEN MERCH THIS IS RIDICULOUS !!!!,0
"For me, spotify is the best streaming platform for people who have other things to do on their phone but still want to listen to music. This app has been with me for aslong as i can remember and you dont need premium to use it while using other apps. Though it is quite a bit laggy, In my pc, it repeats the first 6 seconds of a song over and over, and you have to restart the song inorder to play the song. Overall great app though",0
I give 1 star because I install Spotify to listen music not ads and they take money for remove ads wow black money here too,0
I don't want they added song and extra song in my fav songs and actually in my playlist they so many added and i have 2 song in that playlist I love the songs but when i press the song will be other bc of ur added i wish spotify see this and remove that and pls if i play the song will play until the end of the song not u just press and song a bit and done,0
Ugh...i don't like the new updateðŸ˜’now..i can't hear my fav song when i am play game ðŸ˜­,0
like this app,1
Enjoying listening music and it's free.. thank you soooooo much.,1
i upgraded to premium and the music stopped playing immediately! songs play for a few seconds and stops without any reason!,0
Not 30 min in-between ads to much,0
"Used Spotify for a few years and never had issues, great selection, outstanding quality and easy to use interface but recently my downloaded songs weren't playing when I wasn't connected to the internet even though I have premium, I think it might be the way I set up my account or something was just bugged on Spotify but if there's a way to download songs in the background without me doing it so it's guaranteed to play offline, I will happily give 5 stars but apart from that 10/10 I recommend",1
"Still my favourite app for music and podcasts but I have just one complaint. I'm catching up on a lot of podcasts and when they have a lot of episodes, being able to filter the unplayed episodes is very helpful. Except that I often listen to episodes halfway and then come back to them. And half-played episodes count as played. So I end up having to scroll through hundreds of episodes to find the one I left off on which takes 5000 years",0
I love Spotify because when u go to YouTube to listen to music u can exit the app and listen. But with spotify u can do that so that's why Spotify is a good app,1
Spotify is great! I love the idea of following up great music and podcasts.,1
"Constant crashes and bugs. Same issues have been happening for years, wish they could fix it. Otherwise good app.",0
"Really enjoying the music, made good choice.",1
did really like this app but for 4 or 5 days the app gets permanently stuck after repeatedly playing the same add (Clash Podcast) Has made a great app unusable - will revise stars if/when issue fixed,0
"I just bought a new phone and after logging into my Spotify account on my new device, everytime I hit play on a song, the app crashes. It seems to be the only app which is crashing. I need support to resolve this.",0
Amazing App ! Easy to listen to music on Spotify.,1
Like music download this app then you'll really will love music I did,1
I have had premium for years and I have always had the best experience with Spotify... But I have had the worst experience and loads of issues since the most recent update. Please fix whatever is wrong with this app!,0
Love this app fix the glitches though,1
"At first using spotify was so easy. When i organise some songs in the playlist then i wanna listen to them i listen to the like how i organised them...but now i cant organise and when i do a new playlist with like 5 songs u add some songs and thats so confusing ngl, and i cant listen to my songs oraginized like how i want them for exaple:there is these songs organised like that: bluberryeyes life goes on i need to know deja vu and thats how i listen: need to know woman deja vu Happier",0
Excellent only thing that I don't like are all the adverts..,0
"I've had a reoccurring issue where whenever I play some episodes from REAL AF with Andy Frisella the app would crash, and I'd have to try to play it 3 times over before the crashing stops. Please fix this.",0
All and different music..love it!,1
Works well but only get about 2 songs before you have to listen to 2 or 3 ads.,0
"i love spotify but on my new android (motorola 5g stylus) it randomly crashes the app during a song and when i open it back up the song is there but restarted, its really annoying and needs to be fixed",0
All it plays is we add songs worst music app ever youtubes better fix this plz :(,0
It needs a filter to sort the song by year.,0
"I like it a lot! Music, Podcasts, Saved and Downloadable playlists! Super cool!",1
"If you have premium, it's pretty darn good. If you don't have premium, then there's more ads than anything else. Usually pretty user friendly. I very much like them standing up against Neil Young and refusing to cancel Joe Rogan, though that was mostly a financial decision. I can't really complain, it's the best music platform out there.",1
Why can't I pick the song I like...this sucks!!!!!.. it's free doesn't feel like free,0
excellent apps for music lover,1
All around the best music app I've ever found I love how It's linked up with Shazam makes it really easy to get music to my ear hairs,1
Crashes become more frequent with recent updates,0
The best. Spotify knows what I love. Finds songs to play I've forgotten the best ever Love this app.,1
One of the coolest apps no glitches,1
Amazing app always calms my mood after a long streeful day ðŸ˜Š,1
I will give it 3 stars because there is lots of ads between the song.But it is nice app,1
What happened to the Spotify Session scan feature?? This is not any better. It used to be efficient to scan in the app directly.,0
"Loading, loading, loading, loading, only to finally load and skip the song I selected to some random one. Then more loading, loading........ NOW THERES LAG WHEN SKIPPING SONGS THANKS TO THE LYRICS YOU CANT DISABLE ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š",0
"The app's fine, but when I connect to Bluetooth it automatically starts to play music and there's no way to turn that feature off.. it's really annoying and tedious because even though I never opened the app I can't even close it without clicking on the app and then closing it from there..",0
A very nice music app,1
Great app. Nice audio quality to mention but a few.,1
"It started off fine but increasingly there have been more and more adds and the ""enjoy your next 30 minutes of uninterrupted music"" message is annoying and not true I got a row of adds straight after that message multiple times. The negative outweigh the positive but it is nice to create your own playlist and there is a lot of choice for music which I like",1
This is a every good app,1
Its a good app but if it can provide eng subs to other language songs it would be great so we can understand and relate tho ðŸ™Œ,1
It's a really good app. I use it almost every day,1
"Good application but a very big and huge problem is that The Album of Bohemia "" paisa Nasha piar"" not found",0
Love the music choices. Easy to use.,1
Great music where and when you want it!,1
Really like this app. It has an amazing list of songs. I am curious about why some songs aren't availible - why are they listed. The neverending updates aten't always the best. Could use a tutorial/manual for some things. And to he'll with cancel culture!,1
"Love it!! Thousands of tracks to listen to. From easy listening to heavy metal!! ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ Please stop adding recommendations to my play list, it's getting tiresome removing them. If I want a song, I'll look for it myself ðŸ¤˜",0
"The app loses a part of its interface, in which the app needs to be force closed for it to return. Frustrating to do that a dozen times every day.",0
"I love this app! I have my own playlist I like listening to music, it calms me down. I play my favorite playlist and sleep,, I fell asleep easily whit music playing. I love it!!",1
"Just a honest opinion for me, it's a overall really good app all it needs is a lil bit tweaks here and there especially on the ads as the 30min is not working most of the time, other than that it's fine. Recommend premium if you can afford it. It's worth it in some ways",1
Buggy as hell on S22 Ultra - good when it works as intended.,1
This app is amazing but the voice of songs are very slow,0
"Bring back enhance liked songs. App is getting noticeably slower, such as how long the long press menu takes to open up in order to add a song to queue.",0
I have been using premium for years but within the last week my downloads have been disappearing for no reason after being played once. At this point im ready to just buy the albums i listen to on other platforms since this specific bug has come and gone over the years and should not be present after 6 years of development.,0
"Awesome ðŸ‘ðŸ˜Ž I got to listen to my favorite artist's songs, and at the same time, I can support them through this app. Thanks ðŸ’™ðŸ’™",1
"Everything goes great, amazing audio quality but when my phone is closed I try to pause songs without opening my phone it wont stop. So I'm having to open my phone just to pause my music.",0
"Recent update broken With this last update I have been unable to access any music. It won't play anything. It doesn't allow me to even play downloaded, or even show my music or podcasts. Fabulous, back to not sleeping well. Upset because it's been fine for years. And now that I rely on the stories and mediations to sleep, now it decides to not work at all.",0
I tried lot of music streaming appsbut this is the best sound quality everloved Spotify premium,1
Awesome experience on Spotify!,1
"I've been using Spotify for quite a long time. But lately whenever I play a playlist, it doesn't play the songs that are suppose to be made by the artist. It just plays other songs that aren't even in the playlist. I only want to listen to songs by my fav artist playlist but it keeps playing other songs.",0
"Plain and Simple my go to for music, I'm starting to check out the Podcasts and enjoying them.",1
"I am a premium user, everytime phone restarts it changes storage location from sd card to internal and redownloads 3000 songs. Fix your sh1tty app you money-hungry lazy Devs. If any Dev's gonna reply to my comment, don't even think about asking me to change my default storage location.",0
Whatever kind of songs you want are there. No stress of downloading songs.,1
,1
"Terrible to use lately, lags horribly, makes it pain to even use.",0
"You can stream songs in a lot of places this might be the worst, if you want to make a play list they add songs to YOUR play list and give you only 6 skips an hour so you don't get to listen to your own songs on YOUR play list you don't have enough skips to get to your songs and if you delete them of the play list they add more it is very anoing if you just want to play some music.",0
Sound quality is not good at all. I don't like this app.,0
Exceptional it is a wonderful app that has all you need to listen the latest music the only thing is you need to pay to get the best without adds. ðŸ˜€,1
"Removing app due to Spotify taking the side of spreading dangerous misinformation because it pays big, apparently.",0
I love it app so nice songs ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,1
,1
"Won't stop playing Lynyrd Skynyrd after every song. Doesn't matter what album I put on it plays one track then Lynyrd Skynyrd again. Spotify opens up randomly to play, yes, Lynyrd Skynyrd",1
I love spotify but lately for some reason it's being EXTREMELY buggy.,0
"1/5, ever since I updated this app and opened it, it says I don't have internet connection even tho i have internet connection. I tried searching some popular songs it was loading. I had strong signal, but ofc it would still load.",0
"The filters are annoying. I have to double tap on them for it to work. For example, I tap recently added filter and it doesn't work on the first try.",0
Excellent app... My go-to resource for podcasts and tunes. Keep up the good work ðŸ¤™,1
"Used to be a good app, but new update has ruined it. I've paid a Spotify subscription every month for about 5 years. My experience with this app over the last few days is likely going to make me cancel my subscription. Music stops playing every 20 seconds or so, the bar at the bottom to play/pause using has been taken out. App is totally unusable now.",0
"I'm having the same issues as some of the last reviews, Spotify keeps pausing 3-4 times a song. It's very frustrating and I've starting using another service. Hopefully they can get this problem resolved asap.",0
There is no playback speed. This is issue that i dont like. Please add playback speed,0
Best music streaming app ever! ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘,1
Its the one of the best music applications i have ever used. It also has the great podcasts,1
My experience with Spotify is very good I really enjoy using it Its indeed a good app,1
"Cancelling subscription is a headache, did it a multiple times, still the company was trying to charge my card. User experience is below avarage. The app feels like student project turned over night mass adopted. The irony has it that Spotify is the flagship of the Agile methodology, obviously they fall behind massively. If there would be 0 stars then i would award them. To finish on the positive note, yeah, lot of content that's for sure.",0
It has its problems and it won't work and when I use it on Xbox it just crashes everything.,0
Dosent even have basic features that a music app needs. Only good if you pay for premiumðŸ¦§,0
"This app is ruined now. I pay a subscription for the app to randomly crash, songs to play with no sound and have to be restarted. I listen most days and I can't remember the last time I played a play list and didn't have to unlock my phone to restart the app or go back on to figure out why the music stopped.",0
Podcasts are better if they have captions/subtitles. Some of the songs do not have lyrics. The app would sometimes stop playing and unable to open.,0
One of the most good app for music i ever use you can find any song on this app just search nice to use it and I have a good experience with it,1
Suddenly songs not playing,0
Music is good for what you like. Some dropouts in volume but bearable. Ads aren't too annoying but if you don't want ads get the premium. Otherwise I'm happy with this service.,1
Great service terrible annoying pestering adds and emails I got four emails in one day about the same promotion. I've unsubscribed from the email but the point is that it's shameless and shouldn't happen. At this point I'd rather go back to YouTube adds than deal with this over the top in your face self promotion. Good job losing a customer spotify.,0
"I have been having problems with spotify crashing at randoms times or just for no reason pausing, and it is annoying cause i have to stop mid workout and go to youtube instead!",0
Pretty much unusable in mobile unless you listen to podcasts or buy premium,0
"fix this app, I am never able to run it when I am connected to wifi, fix this",0
Honestly great. It's the best music app I've ever used. Highly recommend.,1
"Wonderfully odd connexions, just slightly disappointed with the settings....really need to be 'lightened' somehow...confusing....but it all works!",1
"Last update has caused a host of issues. Music playing but not shown that it is playing. Music randomly stopping. Can't start or stop music from playing. Lots of connection issues but only within the Spotify app itself. This last update wasn't tested at all. I will have to use another music service until this is fixed, horrible experience so far...",0
It's really wonderful app ðŸ˜Š and very useful too â˜ºï¸,1
"Why are you charging us for an app that doesn't open, an app that does not play a playlist you select, an app that will switch to a song's ""radio"" when an alarm ringtone is chosen from a certain album! Why would you play the album of a ringtone dummies? Why wouldn't the music that was playing prior to the selected ring for an ALARM continue to play after the alarm is snoozed? This app is f'd up and y'all have the audacity to add audiobooks?!? Typical America, won't fix it B4 going to the next.",0
Love Spotify for the fact that I can find a song that pops into my head. When I play it Spotify then continues to play songs based on my song choice ðŸ™‚,1
"Im here to rate Spotify not cuz It's good or anything like that. But to appreciate their amazing Marketing plan. The voice that says ""ever wonder how the other side lived"" is sooooooooo annoying that ppl would ""Switch back"" to premium just so they don't have to hear that voiceðŸ‘ðŸ½",1
"Someone in the review have said this . I'm experiencing a same problem too . Few days ago , everytime I play the music it will auto close and goes to home screen and not be able to played music in my phone, i am frustrated. I've tried to log out log in, uninstalled and install it back nothing able to make it play again. This happens after i updated spotify. PLEASE FIX THIS ðŸ˜­ 1 person found this helpful",0
I can listen to all my music easy to use ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜„,1
It's a good app but don't have so many goddamn ads,1
"I honestly wish they'd just quit tweaking things, and having updates every few days. Just have bigger updates less often. Edited down to 1 star. Why does this app never work? I have to constantly open and close it. I have a newer phone so I don't think it's my phone.",0
Great,1
The app keeps crashing whenever I try to use it and I've looked to see if it needed to be updated and it didn't. Its getting a little annoying to be honest,0
"I've been using this app for about three years, no mistakes at the time, but now why can't I subscribe to premium? Every time I try to sign up, there's something written, like ""unable to connect"" and I'm directed to see the Settings, so please fix it, because I want to hear my favorite song (sorry for my bad eng)",0
Top of the line music service i woud recommend using this service b4 any other music platform,0
"Nice experience, tho I have a suggestion. If you can add more options in the sort option in the 'Liked Songs' category, it will be great. Like sort by Language(Hindi, English Tamil, Malayalam...), Genre(K-Pop, Hip-Hop, Soft, Rock, Rap.....) and so on...",1
I can play song remotely anymore. Yamaha music cast won't work. Chromecast won't work. Terrible. I am so close to deleting this app and my subscription,0
"No play bar suddenly this week, as other users have complained. Needs to get fixed.",0
I love all of the options I have to listen to music on Spotify. Awesome!,1
"if you're on mobile and you don't pay,its annoying, they randomly put songs in your Playlist and force you to shuffle the Playlist leaving you with no choice but to listen to random stuff,and if you wanna skip it you can only skip 6 times per limited hours and ontop of that theres a million adds",0
"Great app, for finding new Music..",1
"Great app for listening to music. Especially since you can close it and still listen to music while doing other things on your phone. Just hate the ads, but I guess that's what pays for the free version if you don't pay for it lol.",0
"The last update ruined my Spotify. The song just randomly pauses for 2 seconds and starts to play again. Also, whenever I try to play a song it plays a different song from the one that I chose.",0
In my region there is no lyrics in the songs.,0
Music bug where it's not showing what it's playing. Need to kill the app. Really annoying.,0
"It's amazing to use Spotify,but am not satisfied with some services because I can't download songs from Spotify.",0
"Don't get me wrong I like Spotify, I just don't like how they add songs to your playlist. I have a playlist I made specifically for my culture and what not and they've added rap country and metal to it. The songs are good I just don't like how they add random genres based off ""because you listened to""",1
"Love this app. Perfect for listening to my musical playlist whilst relaxing, cycling or walking.",1
"It seems like the music controls (skip/pause) are not working for android phones and spotify has yet to address it. All the ""solutions"" and links they have provided are deadends. Please address this.",0
Most of the all time great songs.very good,1
"Spotify is just an awful podcast player and not a great app for playing songs in general. Simple options to control auto download, reorganize, etc, don't exist. It feels like podcasts are tacked on as an afterthought. They really need to fix this if they're gonna keep buying podcasts otherwise I'm just going to stop listening and will switch to non-spotify podcasts to use apps that work well for what they're designed for.",0
I have to say that they have great content but for some reason the app keeps pausing and i couldn't find a reason why it does that .. so is very annoying having to reset every 2 minutes ðŸ™„,0
Great platform to play music ðŸŽ¶ The sound quality is great depending on how old the song is. Other than that it has improved a lot when it comes to locating songs.,1
Way too many ads,0
Not sure why my songs are undownloading or why I can't see what is currently playing and control it. Wish I could give zero stars.,0
If they made a contest who had the best music playlist on their phone I would definitely win because of Spotify straight fire tracks. ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¯,0
"Cancelled premium to try another platform as I find what I'm looking for easier. I'm not saying Spotify is a bad service but once you cancel your plan, a screen with your paying method is shown up to you every time you open the app for you to pay for premium again interrupting you even if you have days left of premium and this becomes very annoying. If they want to keep costumers, I find this a harassing way to do it, to the point that I'm afraid to pay for premium again in the future.",0
Verry buggy experience. Keeps stoping playback randomly.,0
Nothing but a good time every time I turn it on!,1
"I pay for premium, and it works great. Unlimited skips, I can play any song at any time, and there are MOSTLY no adds. For some reason, I still have two or more adds in my podcasts, which are 30-45 minutes. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but it doesn't seem fair that I pay for no adds, and yet there are a surplus of them in every podcast episode.",0
Ok the app is a really good app. Although idk why but it uninstalled itself and wont let me install it back. It might just be my phone but that doesn't make any sense.,0
Can't play music can't download,0
You broke the collaboration feature. I'm downloading a modded version. Idgaf,0
I love it but there are song i dont like but it is exelent love it thara are songs i love so much better than you tubeðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
Very good app but too much ads,0
Its easy to search our faviorate song fastly,1
The app is nice with enough music my qestion is the music only for listen pleasure if i intend to download any choice music how can one go about it because i have being trying to download and i cant see any icon that indicate download.,1
"I've loved you guys since I started. Found a lot of my friends were able to put their music up, too. I love it.",1
"I've used Spotify for years, and I've never really had issues with it until recently. I can't play any songs, my playlists don't show on my library, and when I do pull up my playlists they show as having no songs. I contacted support and nothing they instructed me to do helped in the slightest. This has happened since the latest update to my phone a few days ago, rendering this app completely obsolete. Fix it.",0
Its so easy finding songs and stuff and the quality even without a membership is great!,1
"Hmm,The app is just great. But why 3 stars? The reason being, ads after every 2 songs. That's very annoying and forces to download any other app. ðŸ˜’",0
I'm only trying to pick a song and while I press it play it's picks a suggested song instead of a song that I was trying to play and I keep on having to do it over and over again and it just keeps on putting a suggested song instead of a song that I already picked so I'm leaving a bad review cause this sucks YouTube music is better,0
It's free it's a lot easier to find your music it has a lot more music than some music videos on YouTube YouTube doesn't have all of the music that Spotify has so I encourage you to get Spotify if you want to listen to just like your music right away because you can pick out what you want out of it just so much easier than going to YouTube I already knows what you want to watch because you pick it out at the beginning,1
"All I need for any music can,t fault the app.o.",1
Good sound quality and deep music,1
Facing a lot of issues. Can't even share a link,0
I can't even listen to an album without having to pay for premium. Doesn't make any sense,0
I have the premium so I don't see the ads.,0
"So far so good, recommendation: - make it fun and easy to search wonderful/underrated song, by Introducing some kind of voting mechanism by user, and display it on billboard, updated weekly the song ranking by world or country. Disadvantage: - some song (especially cover by someone else / instrument song) are not available, but other platform like youtube have Reason for subscribing: - to support artist to make wonderful song - searching for wonderful song",1
It's honestly a good music app and it told me to rate them 5 starts,1
App sucks and non functional. Monthly payments for this BS! If I'm paying money for something it should always be functional and bug free,0
Good but when you want to listen to a song you have to listen to 3 songs first and you only get 5 skips per hour,0
I like it! 100 more years of Spotify !!!,1
"It's kinda sad that it allows to skip for a certain amount, and i would use the pc ver than the mobile because it has infinite skips",0
Spotify just loves to randomly delete your downloaded songs forcing you to redownload them.,0
"Easy to navigate have always had the artist I asked for, reliable",1
Great app with a very good sound quality. Works great with my voice assistant too which is a bonus,1
Best app for songs ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡,1
You guys just destroyed the app by taking out the option of playing only the selective song without going through the whole playlist and album. And honestly the algorithm for the playlist sucks it's plays completely unrelated songs.just killing the vibe. Spotify used to be the go to app now I honestly don't even know what the hell you guys are there for?,0
ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜It is very good app with lyrics music ðŸŽ¶,1
"âŒâ€¼ï¸âš THIS COMPANY WANTS TO RUIN PODCASTS. Please join the boycott against spotify. Podcasts have always been free and accessible to all. Spotify wants to change that, it wants to make it so that, like a cable subscription or streaming service, you need to pay an app to stream them on the app's terms. Easier monetization because the app corporation pays podcasters for shows and content and you have to pay the app to access anything. They are buying up beloved podcasts and making them ""exclusives!""",0
Easiest music app ive used. Been using it for ten years.,0
"Good content, less advertising",1
"High quality music source,nice apps",1
This app I can describe . There is no words for this app. But there is a problem there are so many advertisement inbetween the songs and which makes me annoying . And all other things are mind blowing .,0
Please removes the add ðŸ™ ðŸ™ ðŸ˜” Except this i am fully satisfy with spotify,1
It used to work excellent in the car through Android Auto but since the last update it will not connect at all. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it but it still won't connect. Every other app on my Samsung S20 phone works perfectly on Android Auto except Spotify. It still plays on the phone and also with Bluetooth,0
"Most recent update causing Bluetooth issues. Been premium subscriber since 2011. App CONSTANTLY doesn't respond to commands via Bluetooth OR directly in app. Have to restart multiple times, and the bar at the bottom with the current song disappears. I don't pay for updates to be downgrades ðŸ«¤",0
I keep losing the bottom line with the playing track after few minutes. How can I resolve this?,0
Not happy with the hey Spotify thing. I don't like it taking away my control while I'm in a vehicle.....or maybe this is just a bug.,0
Spotify is great it has alot of Verity of music..,1
Awesome experience,1
very disapointed..... im sick off ads. i have money. but i refuse to get a debit etc card (normal bank pass dont work in my country 1 degit to short) i refuse use paypall. same useless practice and i aint make it for just this. allow people to use normal payments directly !!! i dont care if fee or not,0
Love the music and the podcasts!!!,1
"Full of glitches these days. I often spend alot of time making a queue of songs, only to scroll up and find it hasn't registered it and all that effort was a waste of time. And you can't view your library in any logical order, like alphabetically. It's decent for music availability, but really annoying functionally",0
"Best music app, but probably only with premium. Can't speak on the free version",0
This app makes finding the music that suits you easy. It can also pair with several devices enabling you access to the convenience that it provides. This app truly is a masterpiece and I encourage the developer's to keep adding more cutting edge software into the interfaces and security aspects.,1
"Used to always crash before. But it's okay now, loving it! Music keeps me sane. Ive heard abt the karaoke feature. Cant wait!!!!!",1
Best app I just love the app really very nice app ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š seriously love it,1
Recommendations suck and playlist ain't all that either plus I don't like how they backed joe Rogan and how they poorly compensate artist but it's free so it's for me,0
I love it good music,1
Please put the play/pause button back in the middle. It looks horrible on the side and it effects people more than you think ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,0
"The ads that get played during podcasts has a bug. Sometimes you're able to fast forward the ads and the other times, the app crashes and your podcast restarts from the beginning. Then you have to try and remember where you were listening from. It's disappointing from a large app developer",0
"Fantastic app for listening to music and podcasts. My only complaint is that my downloaded podcasts don't show up offline. It may be because I don't have Premium, but the company SAYS I should be able to download and play them offline for free. Not that I'm ever offline. People who rate this app one star for the amount of ads are ridiculous. Yes, sometimes there is a 3:1 ad-song ratio, but ads are hardly ever longer than 30 seconds. Your songs are much longer than the ads you get",0
It's been mentally helpful to my depression... Thank God for Spotify!,0
"Continuously getting worse. Each update to the gui makes it harder and harder to find or organize any of my songs. Crashes and bugs are frequent, sometimes forcing a reinstall just for the app to properly function. Has been this way for years and will probably remain this way due to the developers clearly disregarding the user experience with the idea that they have the monopoly on music streaming apps. Honestly, the only thing this had over Piracy was convinence, and it lost that years ago.",0
Its wonderful,1
"Very good app especially on chromebook so I am able to get unlimited skips per hour, and I am able to play a specific song instead of a playlist that hass the song somewhere in it.",1
Much better than when I first used it more than a decade ago. I'm yet to know any other music repository like it. I duff my hat for Spotify!,0
I love it so goodddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd,1
"I love Spotify its easy to use and has great options but, I don't like it when I ask for Spotify to play Keith Urban and it doesn't pull it up to play his songs except for the ones I liked because it downloaded; always says I don't have internet connection but my phone shows I have plenty 5G full bars. I've closed the app completely, even restarted my phone several times, and checked out to see if I needed to do updates and everything is updated, and I also paid for duo plan. So what now? ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸",0
Best app for music prices are great a d great experience i love it..,1
"Previously I had rated 3 stars bcoz of the ads and lagging... But now, I would rate 10 out of 5.. bcoz of the excellent updations spotify has made. There's hardly any ad now. And the app is smooth like butter. No lagging at all! Just amazing Spotify! Thanks for the updations!",1
Excellent customer care. I totally love the app.,1
Absolutely ðŸ’¯ love Spotify!!! I like the songs it plays for different Music genre!!! Some of those you love but have forgotten about that's what I love about Spotify!!! Leaves you very satisfied and warms my heart with all the old music I listened to growing up!,1
The current version doesn't show the music that's being played. This also means there's no way on pausing/stopping without killing the app. The music is also not playing continuously even for downloaded tracks.,0
Really good I love how I can control Spotify from my watch whilst playing on phone. I'm Not sure if this is because I have an iPhone but o can't seem to play on my watch. I have a ticwatch E3,0
App functions well on both phone and chromebook,1
This app has become an abomination and is completely unusable now. Spent hours trying to figure it out.,0
I can't play the music at all after the latest update,0
"28.May.2022 This app is good I have try many music app but from my view I found it very good but the problem that annoy me and all that in free version you add ad after one or two song before I get 30 min ad free version but now it didn't give and the ad distrub me alot, (my mom don't allow for premium also) fix this because ad after every song is soo much annoying. By the user",0
"its got more music than you can posably listan ,all in digital format",1
Nice app for listening songs,1
"Excellent streaming capabilities,wide variety of songs and podcast",1
The lyrics that come along can be a little proper and it can come in English for songs fin all languages.,1
The app won't show my currently playing anymore. I have to quit the app to get it back.,0
I absolutely love spotify with the most of my goddam heart. I personally have premium but I know everyone else has the same experience as me. I love how easy it is to find similar songs to your favorite ones. I love the genre metal and I just found a good metal band and they just give so many options and just amazing app all around. Oh yea and whoever made spotify needs their a$$ ATE.,1
The ads are so annoying ðŸ™„. There are 3 ads in a row like are you serious??? My cousin only get 1 ads but I get 3 why???,0
"Bruh this is so annoying, it's a good app but there's just really stupid features like when I'm playing my playlist and it plays random songs that I never even added and I cant even remove it, it adds random songs I don't want on my playlist.its gotten to the point where IL search up a song and when I click play it plays a random whole different song, this app sucks now. PLEASE FIX THIS",0
Best birthday present I have ever received from my baby brother! I listen to something at least everyday. So happy of the selection of Christian artists and music. Love finding new artists. Let just listening to great podcasts. Thank you so much for such a wonderful app!,1
Has lyrics to read along with and it is super awesome app!!,1
Unusable without premium. Feels like a version of Itunes from 2004 with how primitive it is without premium. Don't waste your time.,0
"Not sure what you did, but app went to hell in last week. Doesn't show what's playing. Doesn't connect to Bluetooth right.",0
"Today, i tried to switch my account but then i can't even go to the login interface. Forever in loading logo. I also tried to re-install but still the same. I may changed my rating if they fixed this but now I can't use it.",0
"Over all I am satisfied with Spotify. Sometimes it stops working at random and I will have to shut down the app down. This is rare, but very inconvenient when it occurs. Perfect for Podcasts or music!",0
I can no longer Support or enjoy Spotify as long as Spotify supports the spread of misinformation.,0
"Was an amazing app, and now after the latest update I cannot download spotify on my phone again, even though it's clearly compatible.",1
FIRE,1
App shuts off midway through music and the control panel disappears. This has been going on for months now.,0
"Not working.. Clear the catch, clean data.. Everything ll be try to open.... Nw what can do, iz working probably...???",0
"Thank you Spotify support team, I've got my lyrics now :)",1
You can read the other reviews I've also had problems with the display of what you're listening to and it just constantly pausing,0
"What is going on with all the bugs? Spotiy has always been wonderful until the last few months. Bugs, skips, doesn't pop up what im currently listening to, so I can't pause or stop the music without having to close the app. I'm really hoping this gets fixed and I dont have to cancel my subscription â˜¹ï¸",0
My experience with spotify so far has been very good ðŸ‘,1
First wrote this review in 2018 and still the same problem now in 2021. Please up your game. Especially with since I pay premium. I love this App. I have premium. But haven't been using it lately as it always takes a long time to load playlists or search. Please fix it.,1
"The app is run by people that elevate the voices of bigots and rip off artists. I switched to Tidal. It has a vert similar interface and just as many songs, without the gratuitous use of the ""n"" word, referring to POC as apes, grotesque misogyny and objectification of women, public health misinformation, etc.",0
"Crashing constantly since the last update. I've been a premium subscriber for about a decade now, and this is the most unstable update I've seen. Please be so kind as to fix this soon. Maybe even today?",0
Then reason I give it 3 start is because on mobile it picks random songs that aren't on your Playlist or it skips to another song and it doesn't let you pick the exact song you want but on pc or console it does the opposite but other than that it's fine,1
why the app always out when im about to play music?,0
"I've used Spotify for years now. I love the endless music, books and podcasts. I don't need multiple different apps taking up space which is a bonus.",1
Best app for songs and clear sound,1
Videos quit playing. Can't open viewer or change place because it's on start and pause.,0
"I want to ask if the version of Spotify does change by location? As it has a complete different UI in India than in the UK. The UK version has a lot of restrictions such as, one can't play songs directly in playlist or likes playlist but have to play by shuffle and can't skip more than some songs in an hour. The Indian version was very flexible and user friendly while UK version is pathetic. Please throw some light on this",0
Really good music streaming app,1
Worst app ever used. It has more adds than songs that we search for. Irritating adds force me to uninstall.,0
Sometimes doesn't show you the current song that is playing when the app is open of playing in the background on Android devices so cannot click on it to pause/play/rewind etc,0
I have a premium account but I couldn't play my downloaded playlist everytime I go offline.,0
this is very nice aap,1
The best music streaming app. Based on my opinion.,1
"I didn't expect this from spotify....what happening is whenever i open the app i wont play the song i want,it wont load correctly and then it kicks me out after saying im not connected to the net ðŸ˜¤ i do not accept this",0
The best Online Music App I've ever used. I'm happy you've introduced it in Kenya.,1
"Can find anything I want to listen to whether it be any type of Christian music, Lectio Divina meditation, podcasts, classical music, nature sleep tracks, even obscure music from decades ago when I was growing up (Henry Lauder, anyone?). I think Spotify is great - and I only use the free version!!",0
"It's a nice app I enjoy it but it misbehave after using it for some time, it doesn't show playlist you can't select a specific song in the playlists available. I know the is need for upgrade to premium but the limitation you have put in place are not important you can find another way not denying people to select their song of choice. At least downloading for offline is enough limitation for those who are not on premium. Anyway it's a good app.",1
Easy to use. Lots of music to choose from,1
"Im a fan of spotify but the new update disappointed me. I can't even play the music I want, I need to wait a hour to shuffle it to listen to the musoc I want to hear. The new update sucks. It's harder to used. The last version is better. And the limited skips drives me crazy. I can't even skip the intro of the song because I can't control it. I hate the update. The ads are not tolerable.",0
All bugs and errors fixed at last. Spotify is again back as best streaming platform for music and podcasts.,1
Well apps and music callection is very good .,1
it was a good app but recently like the past 2 months i cant edit or even see my playlists its so annoying and it dont even play them or my podcasts idk what happened but i really dont like it,0
Using in landscape format messes up the formatting. The rewind and shuffle button get squashed together,0
one of my playlists is not showing on my profile please fix that apart from that this is the BEST app i have ever used,1
Good music and i love this app,1
Very glitchy lately periodically turns off then turns back on,0
Amazing,1
Audio keeps dropping. Among other issues.,0
Have used many different services but Spotify is still one of the best. Tons of features and good layout. Just wish you could upload your own music but that is a rare feature.,1
"New update is awful, keeps cutting out won't let me skip or pause music. By the looks of it everyone is having the same issues. Please fix soon or I will have to change to another service.",0
Please bring podcasts n other services to BANGLADESH ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡© for free,0
"Usually good times. Lately, the Now Playing bar hasn't been showing at the bottom. Frustrating, as this is the most important part of the app... Can't pause, play, skip, etc.",1
"Great app used it for years, but it crashes all the time now, anyone else have this issue? If I'm not it's going through songs it's fine!",0
Too much of ad I hate this ðŸ˜’,0
"Awesome ,Ifonly they had kiwi classics like south side of Bombay would be a 5.",1
Never touched my phone while driving until i paid for spotify premium and had the app randomly crash for no reason other than lazy development,0
"I have be on Spotify for quite some time. I downloaded the app to continue to listen to my music without having to be on my computer most of the time. As I'm writing this, I am listing through every Dean Martin album. But with the shuffle on, I CAN'T LISTEN TO IT IN ORDER. And I'm not buying premium since the free account is fine with me. But if you pushing me to buy it? Think again. Fix this BS please.",0
PLEASE FIX! Latest update constantly skips songs every couple seconds when you connect it to a Bluetooth device,0
Awesome app,1
Want better tamil lyrics in both english and Tamil. Sometimes autoplay song genre based on search is unrelated. Ad appearing in between two songs is quite hindrance,0
"Attention Android Users: unfortunately, there are better alternatives to this app. What's wrong with it? * Shuffle will very frequently NOT work, prompting you to restart the application. Shuffle will also frequently replay songs that you've already heard on a playlist. * ""Skip Forward 15 seconds"" - this feature only works if you have the app OPEN and are LOOKING at the screen. Otherwise, if you just double tap a bluetooth earbud, it'll skip 5 seconds at a time. Insanity. * Podcasts: as a premium user, it is UNACCEPTABLE to be forced to listen through advertisements, which are often unskippable. Unacceptable. The ""skip ahead 15 seconds"" feature FREQUENTLY stops working during ads... How convenient. * Further Bugs - the program simply is not optimized to be run on Windows or on Android. It's clear that Spotify was made on Apple, by Apple devices, FOR Apple devices. Which is weird, because Apple Music is a better service. Until Spotify addresses these issues, I cannot recommend the app. It isn't ready yet. Maybe in a couple years when the developers decide it's worth investing in Android devices, it'll be at a more stable, usable place. But until then, I recommend you download music files to your phone and use some music player to play them, instead. Spotify is lower bandwidth/bitrate than you'd get supplying your own music files, you won't have to deal with advertisements, and you also won't have to deal with the application absolutely shutting down and malfunctioning every time you change cell towers/wifi connections/bluetooth connections. Spotify just is not worth it. This is as lazy as a mainstream product could possibly be. Engineered enough to just barely work.",0
I have enjoyed hearing each song sent to me or I have looked for.,1
Not used to the interface yet.,0
"Well I really appreciate the playlists that I get , though the accuracy level sucks sometimes but thats fine. But PLEASE CHANGE YOUR ADS MAN ! I'D BE LISTENING TO KOREAN , ENGLISH AND ASSAMESE SONGS ALL MY LIFE AND YOU ARE GIVING ME AN AD FOR PUNJABI AND TELEGU PLAYLIST ??????? ðŸ™„",0
Did the person who created this new UI not use any technology ever? Why can I not control scroll down in a playlist that way I used to you,0
Holding premium subscription for more than 2 years. Best music app but still waiting for ashlee Simpson's L.O.V.E song on Spotify ðŸ˜…,0
Love this app But problem is that we can't listen song of our choice,0
"Spotify has chosen to align itself with the anti-vac and misinformation movement. Wasn't particularly good before, definitely not worth supporting now",0
"Great app, only app I use for high quality music. I pay for Premium Duo. But since this last update I am having CRAZY bad problems! My playing music bar disappears and I have to reset it a few times to get it back. Ugh help.",0
Easily the worst app experience I've ever had. Every update messing up so many things. UI still confusing and terrible. App isn't registering when I am playing a podcast or song. And randomly stops playing some times.,0
"Excellent app.. Nice playlists, easy interface.. 5 stars",1
Why I gave Spotify 4 stars is because it doesn't let me play the songs I want to hear and I hate that,0
"This app is really good for music and we can also listen to the latest songs but there IS some problems. First of all, the ads, I'm not saying to remove them, but atleast reduce them. Second of all the quality of music, there are other apps which provide better quality, try to give better quality in music. AND I do have to appriciate the playlist that the app makes for me. Most of the things are best in the app but try to fix the issues mentioned above.",0
"The app just randomly stopped working one day. It gives an error message now when I try to click on literally anything. Can't play music, and I'm a premium user. Please fix this.",0
"I can't listen to full songs, why?",0
Great app for listening music. But sometimes adds interrupt the music and that's painful.,0
"Overall it's amazing experience,from various podcasts to all the musicians,artists,bands,labels etc i find spotify entertaining,educational...ðŸ˜Š",1
So many bugs on my Samsung10 always stops playing randomly even when music or podcast has been downloaded. Downloaded music sometimes not available offline for some reason. Now there are ads for podcast even though I pay for premium???,0
"Randomly skips to next song. Decides it doesn't want to play some songs, some times. Plays one song, but won't play the next one.",0
Unable to play the audio I downloaded while flight mode or offline.,0
"I've been using this app for a long time now and it's a good app I won't lie, I just don't want it to add songs to my Playlist. I will make a Playlist for specific songs to listen to but then it would add more songs I don't really want to listen to.",1
I am a frequent Spotify USA listener and also a Premium member Your app is exquisite as always A big Thanks to your universally vast music archives and artist selections But as I also subscribed and use the YouTube Music unlimited subscription App it sounds better when you compare the audio quality to Spotify apps music quality Could it be because that app costs more per month?? Anyway Spotify is too good,1
Awesome but can reduce the number of ads,0
Spotify changes my songs by itself. It's fustrating especially when I'm driving and there's not jack I can do about it.,0
There are some serious issues with this app lately. We pay for a premium family subscription. Why the app keeps stopping even though it shows its still playing is driving me crazy! I pay for customers to be able to listen to music at my events. It stops playing every time there is a new email or message or no reason at all. Even when I've downloaded Playlist or listening to a podcast. This has been going on too long. Please fix it!!! Looking to replace this app now.,0
"1 star, because I can't play any song I want at any time (as any normal music app should) and only letting me listen to preview of said song, and always adding 100 random songs to my Playlist, while giving me 6 skips an hour while locking the feature to choose any song you want behind a paywall. Very bad app. You guys are crooks.",0
why can't i download the entire playlist? it takes a lot of time to download the song one by one.,0
Ok so my lil bro broke my other phone that worked perfectly fine so then I got a new phone and when I play Spotify like when l want to listen to some music and do done else on my phone the music will take a while to stop and then l try to play music again then l open a app and the music will go away but overall it's a good app,1
The experience has been amazing you even create your own playlist which is so nice and listen to podcasts and etc but sometime personally me it has some of it's glitches but it's amazing,1
Cool music ðŸŽ¶ of infinite reservoir of storage. It goes all back to antiquity. All the best Team Spotify!,1
Easily the best way to hear your favourite music and listen to artists you've never heard of but Spotify reckon you'll love. It educates your ears!,1
"Yes, they fixed the scrolling searches! Thank You!",1
"I am a paying user and have been for over 4 years now and suddenly cannot log on to my android app at all, I keep getting told I'm offline, and to check my connection, clearly I am online. I have been dealing with this for over a day now. Fix this please or I'm cancelling my subscription.",0
I can't belive I'm actually paying mony for this worthless app. Used to work fine but now it keeps stoping unexpectedly or getting stuck and I can't stop the music. Had to reinstalle 5 times this week,0
"This could be an amazing app but change my mind...theres nothing wrong with the songs, this app does.....dont ask why i gave it 1 star, there are things that annoys me.",1
I love the app though the thing is they add songs you don't want and if u wanna continue playing the song you have to watch an add but it isn't that bad but if you could make a playlist without adding new songs it would be perfect and I would recommend this app,1
Very nice,1
Why even add the playlist feature if you arn't gonna play the songs I added? ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,0
"The service is easy to use. The UI is simple, yet elegant, responsive and easy to navigate.",1
"It used to be so good, I had premium for years and i still would. But its not worth it anymore. Its super glitchy and buggy, even in premium. They tried to simplify it and 'have better used experience' but all that they did was make it bad. Please go back a version or two and keep it that way. I used to love the app",0
"My review keeps being removed, wonder why. As a music app it is fine, they should pay the artists fairly however. Navigating for podcasts is clunky on mobile, doesn't load automatically to the last episode you listened to.",0
Best music platform!! A +,1
"I love this app, and have paid for premium but literally every damn time I install it, and open it, and exit it, for some dumb reason that I have yet to figure out, it uninstalls itself!!!! WTH is going on with it and how do i fix it!!!!",0
"Love from India â™¥ï¸ I still remember the day the app released here years ago. I was so happy, and I still am!",1
I love the experience Ive been using sportify since 2019 and its amazing unless its a premium version not the free one,1
"The last few updates have not only made it harder to listen and navigate in the car, but now won't even show the music slider or pause button when you're on the app.",0
"It's pretty good and the songs are rlly good but I hate how you have to pay just to skipðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸It's annoying but it's a good app i wanna skip a song and it won't let me, I have to pay, just brutal",1
"I left Spotify for Deezer. The Deezer app actually works, and doesn't randomly just stop working -- a bug Spotify still hasn't fixed even 6 months later",0
Whenever I am swiping through songs in a playlist the app will constantly crash and it's extremely annoying. Please fix this and I will give a 5 star rating,0
Great music app!,1
I love the variety of music and podcasts on here but this app on my android continually force closes without warning. Half the time the music bar with the play button doesnt appear and I can see / control what is playing beyond shuffle and I pay for premium. Very frustrating.,0
"Great resource of music, and it is easy to find songs you don't remember the title of. I recommend this app.",1
Awesome,1
"This is the best app I use for listening songs! But I can't download songs or playlists unless and until I purchase the premium version. But that's OK. At least this is better than gaana which used to take my whole 1 GB just to listen a small 20 songs playlist.I suggest that this is the best app to listen songs to. And it is really convenient for me when I have to listen only one artist's songs; they also have made special playlists for artists, And also made genres of music.",1
In the recent update play controls sometimes disappear ans sometimes the whole app stops.,0
"Smooth operation, easy to use, link up with everything and everyone.",1
"Hello, I've recently experienced problems with playing both music and podcasts with the Spotify app on my phone. It just quits. I can't play anything. When I tap the play button my screen turns white, then the app crashes. I've tried reinstalling it, but the problem is still there. Please issue a fix asap",0
"Updating review: The latest update has changed Spotify from one of the most reliable apps on my device (Pixel 4A, 5G) to one of the least consistent. In about 8 years I've never had any issues with the service or app, which I see as one of my most trusted. Unfortunately the current build suffers frequent playback issues .. AUDIO ISSUES: buffering and stuttering, prioritising video over Audio (let me disable videos!). The device WiFi broadcasting frequently fails. All most recent reviews agree!",0
Buggy. Playing a song or playlist doesn't show the controls or which song is playing until I close and reopen the app.,0
Life is boring and dull without spotify. 10/10 would recommend.,0
Spotify is good experience as is. Joe Rogan podcasts and the music are great.,1
As A Musician. I Love â¤ï¸ Spotify!!!,1
"The music is good, but the main problem are the podcasts. I cannot even hide them! They are so irrelevant to me and I will NEVER listen to those trash. I will change the review back to 5 if I had that feature.",0
"Spotify ads songs to my Playlists for some reason let's me have ""6 skips per hour"" won't let me listen to my songs and is overall garbage with this update I recommend youtube music or SoundCloud over this trash might delete this app I think I'm the only one experiencing this issue oh also it won't let me play the songs in my Playlist that I have and it adds like 50 songs into my Playlist that I don't even like!",0
"User interface almost useless. Shows me what YOU think I should be listening to and makes it difficult to find my own stuff. Sometimes impossible to find the start stop controls, especially since the last ""Update"". Looking for an alternative.",0
Nice music app thank you spotify.,1
Sound quality is decreasing...,0
Easy to use and create playlists. Good recommendations and podcast choices. Only problem is the app sometimes has issues with lag and freezing but no other bugs otherwise,0
Easy-to-use and so much music,1
I have really enjoyed Spotify since I've started using it,1
"i have a spotify premium account ever since I had one the app keeps closing and stopping, which ofc annoys me please fix your system first, but it's worth the money tho",1
"Used to love Spotify but something happened in the last month where the app quit connecting to the Spotify app on two separate head units in my vehicles. Would be a shame of they did this to force people into buying the Spotify ""car thing"".",0
Great music selection on ny playlist...A wonderful music app in general,1
"While giving ads in kannada channels, use kannada songs. We have countless superb songs in kannada. Respect kannada and Karnataka.",1
Why i cant open my spotify apps,0
"It's waaayyyy better than that other service that has the image of a certain fruit and says ""music"" behind it.. jus sayin",1
"About a year since last I stop using. Giving it a try again, aand nope. Now, the PC side is still good. But if the mobile side have annoying UI/UX and functionality like this, it disincentives me to stick with the service.",0
"I love this app , the variety is executed. Thanks",1
"I enjoy the literal side of music that doesn't criticize, rate, judge, or praise.",1
I personally love Spotify BUT the new update where you can't shuffle from the button is ANNOYING. I have to keep skipping to find the song that i like more . It's so FRUSTRATING when i can't re shuffle it and it needs to be fixed.,0
I was Pandora all the way until my sister introduced me to Spotify. Haven't been on any other music app since.,0
"Used to put a clip of the song in items shared to other platforms... no longer. Very sad, was 5 stars.",0
"Amazing app. I am using it since years. However, monthly subscription should be reduce for YOY users/customers to give benefit for long term users.",1
Best thing since microwave pot pies!,1
"amazing app for streaming music and podcasts, no issues presented over the last 5ish years using. thank you spotify â¤",1
lags a lot sometimes,0
I can't support an app that gives a stage for deadly disinformation agents. Too many lives have been lost because of evil a holes that promote antivaxer propaganda.,0
I love â¤ï¸ Spotify music and the GREATEST OF Jo ROGAN PODCASTER,1
No problem with downloading songs,1
Ahh. It gets so frustrating when you can't get premium and it adds songs to your playlist when you just want to listen to your dang songs,1
"This app is great. The only problem that I have with it is that it is really laggy. Some of my songs won't play will use my skips. Also, I'll use one skip and the app won't let me use any more of my skips. This was all a while ago but I thought I should let you guys know. I have premuin now and it works great.",0
I pay for a subscription and there is no way to dislike a song. Also stop supporting people spreading incorrect information about covid.,0
"Extremely buggy recently. Stops randomly and play/pause/skip widget disappears. No sign of the 'now playing' section either. As a premium user and have been for 10+ years, very disappointed.",0
I like because you can still listen to your music when you are in the middle of playing your games,1
It has alot of good songs but there is the point that only premeum can skip ads and have free skips and they add songs of their own that they think you'll like but i hate them its a great app apart from that,0
The control panel for the song won't show so I'm unable to pause/play next/previous my songs and have no control except clicking on songs. Fix this.,0
Best music streaming app. Like the laylout.,1
Spotify has the music I enjoy listening to.,1
"I realy enjoy this app a lot,and what's interesting it formulates a special track list, what an amazing app,but one thing though you can only download via premium",1
Very good app,1
"I like to use this app for songs because I can play music while looking at other apps, saves my favorite music, makes a Playlist off what I like, which I loves that and it works for me",1
Love Spotify always find something to listen to.,1
Best app for music there is.!,1
Omg this app is amazing! It has lots songs and podcasts to listen to and the little clips in some songs are so intertaning. The song that I like downloads in seconds and it is the only music app you should install because of all the amazing features. This is the best music app EVER. And I love how you can make your playlists public so other people can listen to them. The only thing I dislike is that one of my playlists is not able to be public but otherwise this app is fantastic! ðŸ˜Š,1
"Since upgrading my phone, spotify is lagging badly. Galaxy s20 5g. Update, the latest update needs to be looked at! Keeps pausing and some adds just don't play.",0
"Sound quality is just amazing, love everything about it",1
I love Spotify. It's the best music app ever,1
App crashes too much,0
"They insist on throat-f***ing you with podcasts, even though I couldn't care less about them as they aren't what I'm paying for. If they'd at least make it a section of the app instead of the first 10 rows you see when you open it, I'd totally change the review.",0
Good,1
"Every since I converted to premium I haven't received premium service. Music won't play on wifi or on 5g cell service. There is a big lag. And it is frustrating that I'm paying for a service that I can't even use. I have a Galaxy s22 ultra. Please tell me how to fix this problem. Latest updates, delete and re install, still haven't figured out the way to fix this problem.",0
I used to be a big fan of spotify but up till these last couple of months I've been rethinking my opinion. Now we have to pay for premium to replay a song and not all of us want to do that. There is other things that spotify has changed and I think it was unnecessary for them to do so. I don't want to go into great detail because that would be to much to type so there for I will keep the rest of my thoughts and opinions to myself. But spotify is a good choice if you want to pay. ðŸ™ƒ,1
My worship music on SPOTIFY really inspires and lifts me daily!,1
I liked the app for a while but suddenly i started having problems with it starting to play songs randomly whenever I am in my car.,0
I've been dealing with a mini form of depression and Spotify has been helping a lot. I definitely recommend this app to anyone who loves music or is going through a lot as well.,1
It's really goodalthough it needs ti ad a feature where u can listen to music but u still get ads and u can't download songs. Other than that I really love using the app so 5/5 from me â¤,0
Un app increible solo con el inconveniente del premium pero fuera de eso es increible la variedad de musica y podcasts que hay simplemente asombrosa la accesibilidad y variedad que tienes un 55 en mi opinion,1
Why it crashes every time i want to upgrade to premium????,0
I can download songs but i used to play it on spotify i used my data for just to listen songs but why too many ads? After one or two song 2 ads for sure im tired change app system otherwise we will delete the app,0
I love all the songs and how the lyrics work.,1
As convenient as the app is its got some glaring issues. First of all if you download songs it still streams them vs using the download files. I know this because when I try to play a band I've downloaded it always delays going to an album or song if internet gets in a patchy area. As soon as I put it on airplane mode it works fine. Unlike the YouTube app where you download and it'll always play the downloaded video. I feel like this app is 15 yrs behind what other apps have figured out in 09,0
"July 6th, 2022. Just came back to Spotify today around 03:37, I'm not amused on how the Audio Devices I'm using currently onto Bluetooth and AUX Cable too, I used to have a quite different experience than a lower mono-audio about now. By the way; the sound was needed to be up around 94% oye. Ad's are fine but gives you 30 minutes of listing to music; But other devices that I use this app isn't the same, I only use shuffle mode.",0
I'm not able to share my playlists anymore without making them accessible for everybody. Gives an no internet connection error on recieving device. Also sharing from playlist menu vs sharing from inside certain playlist somehow gives different results. Basically it's a mess and hving to learn that Spotify made my playlists public without asking me is a move that will alinate me from this software provider in the end.,0
Love the app but is crashing too much lately. Will use Amazon until there's another update to fix this problem.,0
Am new to this app it was recommended to me but it's so annoying as though as I can't use it to download songs to listen to when I'm offline Why can't I download songs for offline use?,0
"For an app that has been available for 8 years, the amount of issues I have is frustrating. Like some other say, it stops playing randomly while in the background, even though I allow background data use and all that. At times while running in the background, the app dissappears from my toolbar and I have to open it independently, then I have no way to click on what is playing at the bottom so I must force close it.",0
Horrible premium ads. Guaranteed to bug you. No respect for local languages or culture in their ads. Spreads anti vax propaganda,0
"Computer version is much better and has a repeating option. On phone app it doesn't work. You can pick the song you wanna hear instead of random, unlike the app",0
The app constantly crashes. Sometimes the podcasts are not downloaded despite me downloading them before.,0
Love being able to pick the artist I want to listen to.,1
Good app all musics are available but the add is so long,0
The only reason I use this because of the pure output and I preferred to be a premium user cause ads are more. How ever in premium the output will be crystal clear with best eq's and smooth bass when compared to normal ones.,1
"Usually great, but the enhance button will sometimes glitch out and shorten the playlist as well as recommend already added songs",1
Not 100% in selection,0
Pretty much has all the songs I like. There are a few songs I wish were on here tho,0
You can't click a song and have it play and its annoying.,0
"Overall very enjoyable & entertaining! I drive for a living, at the very least 8 hours a day but sometimes up to 17. It's great to just settle in & listen to podcasts or stories while driving so much.",1
"Good and all But a issue has arisen I can not unhidden songs for some reason or another, hope this gets fixed or something",0
Randomly stops playing music. Samsung S8. Have to unlock device for music to start playing again. Even with full service.,0
Issues with skipping are bad enough now song radios don't always include the song it's building a radio station on...,0
"The controls disappear regularly, not only on the app, but also in the notification bar, and headphone and car controls also stop working. This is especially annoying when driving since the only fix seems to be closing Spotify and opening it again.",0
Worth the premium and when it's free,1
Pretty good app overall can be a little slow sometimes like when I'm in the car it takes a while for songs to load when there downloaded and u have to have internet to look at the lyrics even if the song is down loaded ðŸ˜† lol,0
Worst music app can't play music that I want,0
Trouble using when phone paired with vehicle but will try again after taking steps.,0
Great app this let you listen to whatever you want to here even if a old jam !,1
It so nice,1
This app worked for a while but then it deleted ALL of my liked songs and now NOTHING will work. It used to be so good and not it's HORRIBLE!!!!!!,0
Amazing Just Amazing ðŸ˜€ altho premium membership does ccost some money it's worth it ðŸ˜Š,1
Easy to use and great variety,1
"And again - Nothing has changed! Original postðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸- The App now: Stops every 10 minutes. Carrys on playing & cannot be shut down. Does not upload. Yes, I've uninstalled. The latest update is poor, I have no idea how the UX or QA cycle ever got signed off. Downloaded content will not play when you move onto another episode. Cuts out. UI looks crowded and not smooth at all. Paying premium for a product that does not work properly. Acknowledge & own the faults Spotify, then fix! Thanks",0
Buggy as hell lately. Player controls dissappear until restarted. Suffer for some features from the webapp-dont-remember-scrollposition syndrome. Eg. On the podcast list view. Also frequently forget where my current position in a podcast episode is.,0
Can't play Spotify when on WiFi,0
The app is good but sometimes it is not showing the music dialog box in the screen or in the app .i have to restart again.it is too frustrating hope Spotify clears the problem,0
Simply the best online music player,1
The ads bro all ads I can't playmy favorite song anymore>:(,0
Spotify is a great app. It's kinda just like an upgrade to Pandora.ðŸ˜‚,1
"Decent selection of music, but borderline unusable due to frequency of ads that are SIGNIFICANTLY louder than the music. No one needs that jarring experience.",0
Way too many ads,0
"This is a fab app that I pay premium for, so worth it. One small thing this week the Sky VIP Official Top 40 hasn't refreshed since last Sunday (Sunday 15th May 2022). Otherwise I am enjoying my Spotify experience.",1
favorite apps,1
It's a nice app but there's a few songs that's not added. Hope the songs will be added,0
I love the fact that there's only a handful of ads! More music & more talk!,0
Way too many ads. Jst to for for premium.. Are u guys serious I mean i cud download music files form somewhere else.. And if I want latest music I cn check on u tube seriously u guys are getting worse and worse jst belive me after some month or mayb a year this app is going down,0
Fails to play more than four songs successively without crashing. Looking forward to a fix that will return the app to its usual state of mediocrity.,0
Ads suck bit other than that it's pretty cool,1
If I can't change the theme of my lyrics at least give me nice themes because your current themes are very boring,0
"Seamless streaming, intuitive recommendations and every artist you could hope to find.",1
I love this app I use it nonstop but every time I leave the app it randomly stops the music...,0
The best music app out there.,1
"The new enhance feature is awesome, the algorithm has added so many songs I love that I never would've heard of to my playlists",1
After all these years I still can't delete the current song from the playlist that's playing without having to scroll through all songs (1000+) in the playlist to find that one song that's currently playing.,0
Why addsðŸ˜©ðŸ˜© and also it keeps telling me to update no matter how many times i update it and also whenever i tap the wraps story it says something went wrong! The internet connection is just fine !!!!,1
Love this app love the song happy face,1
I love this app never have any problems they always artist new music I wouldn't trade it with anything else ðŸ’œ,1
"I honestly hate the ads, spotify would be the absolute best music player without the ads and if it had a song finder, where if you have a song playing, you click listen and search song, and it finds the song your listening to and brings it up, and you can add it to your playlist(s).",1
I will never use premium. Show me adds as much you can.,0
"China style censorship, need more free speech platforms like Rumble. Alex Jones was correct so you banned him and others. Banned.video for real information. Stand with freedom or lose.",0
Spotify is great,1
My Spotify keeps crashing even after reinstalling this has never done to me before. Is there a way to fix this. It's already at its latest version.,0
"Spotify is a non-free Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded on 23 ... In May 2013, Spotify acquired music discovery app Tunigo. Founder(s): Daniel Ek; Martin Lorentzon Founded: 23 April 2006; 16 years ago Headquarters: Stockholm, Sweden; New York, United States Employees: 7,690 (2021)",0
Music is great. But the ads every 10 minutes are starting to annoy me tf off. It's supposed to be 30min free listening right? I get adds from every 5 minutes to every 10 bloody minutes.,0
Nice app,1
"Too many ads! Literally 3/4 ads after 1, maybe 2 songs. Sometimes 5, 6 ads! Didn't used to be that way. Is since Rogan controversy. Not sure why people who love music have to suffer because of this irresponsible Podcasters, but it seems we are. Lame.",0
My favorite music app works great all the time I never have issues with it,1
Idk whats going on but lately the songs are skipping like an old CD or something. Its annoying af,0
"Has been great up until a few weeks ago, the player controls disappear mid listening, can't see what is playing even though can hear it, can't stop it playing when i want to, end up having to close the whole app down and sometimes have to reset the phone just to get the player controls back! Same thing happens to my partner's spotify as well. Spotify please sort it out as it's getting irritating!",0
It's a good application and I like it. My only complaint is that the ads are over and it's been angrier,1
Soo ooooooooooo good,1
Probably the worst music streaming app on Playstore.,0
Best music app ever ,1
Constantly glitching. Almost unusable.,0
"Premium member who has high quality on and it is terrible audio on good speakers. Incomplete albums due to deleted content, missing songs not licensed or something. Amateur discography collections missing major works. App plays music not in a playlist despite having that option turned off as a premium member. Library page on phone is a mess due to previous listens. Finding playlists among many becomes a drag. App always bugging with popups during car. Works better on laptop, theres that.",0
TERRIBLE! compared to the other platforms this one is DISSAPOINTING! Seriously? I have to pay for the songs I want to play without it choosing something else? 1/10,0
I just one to say that without this i can't listen very cool quality and I love it,1
OP,1
"When I 1st got the app I barely used it. It was different than what I was used to. Now I use this app daily and would not want to go without it. You just need to take a little time to get your favorite music , specific songs and more. Nice!",1
"Since we cannot go to half stars, im rounding up. My daily mix consistently gave me good songs throughout my day at Carowinds. My only problem is that i cant look up specific songs like on computer. So, for mobile, 9/10. For PC, 10/10.",1
Spotify was really good until the new update. No longer connecting with Android Auto. Same issues as others are having all because of the new update,1
"Really good app, I love it!",1
"Keeps me and work(WFH)going, always and also when on the road(driving or running).",1
Honestly love this app gets me through my day and works well the adds aren't so consistent so it doesn't really bother but I would love to atleast have the control over changing my songs even if I'm not signed up for the premium version but still a pretty good app,1
It's great the night time features help to set a timer so I can listen to podcast as I fall asleep would definitely recommend 5 out 5 stars,1
I don't like this I avoid it but spotify lite likes me I can avoid it,0
when is that video plus lyric thingy coming to india??? i also want to experience that. edit: it's 05/ 2022 still not up,0
The new update is horrible. The mini player fails to load. I've lost all music controls both in the app and out of it. Moving outside my vehicle it continues to play at full volume even though I'm not connected to anything. It's full of bugs. It won't even play through a Playlist without crashing now.,0
"Used to be a great app. But now if you're a Samsung Galaxy user there is no more visible player. Which means you can't pause, start, stop, skip or go back a track. It also now crashes regularly. I've been a premium user without these issues for years, but now it is hardly worth the subscription. It would be useful if Spotify could rectify these issues enabling the user to have some sort of listener control. Update: it had been fixed but now the same issue is happening again in July 2022.",0
app keeps shutting itself off in the middle of songs,0
"Update the app. This is ridiculous. Paying for premium and it stops playing, can't see what's playing next, widget functions don't work, also plays randomly. Play lists vanish, can't control my music. Refund premium customers whilst it's this broken!",0
Ever since the last update 4-5-22. The app with pause randomly even on downloaded songs. Also the pause and play button is always stuck on play with music already playing,0
In 2022 Spotify still does not offer the option to select multiple albums/songs/... I had to select everything for manual download again after reinstalling Spotify due to the massive amount of errors I had,0
Anything you want to listen to with killer playlists.,0
"Amazing, ive been a premium member since 2019 but i recently switched my music to my SD card, sadly it keeps pausing so I resorted to uninstalling then reinstalling the app . Please fix this problem. UPDATE: So unfortunately after having this problem I had to redownload EVERY SONG ALBUM AND PLAYLIST all over again to even stop the pausing",0
my bell icon(new song/nortification icon ) is not workingðŸ˜‘,0
"it was fine since a few weeks back but now the apps glitvhing too much. when playing a song, the songs name, the cover nd artist is not being displayed. In the free, when shuffling, it's getting shuffled twice despite clicking it once, and the songs skipping to the next one in the middle",0
All Trending music and albums are available. Impressive UI.,1
i have premium but podcasts I don't even listen to pop up every time i open the app it's REALLY annoying,0
"I love listening to music daily, and spotify make it easy to stort out my music and make playlists. Even whithout spotify premium I still enjoy the app. The daily mixes are a feature that I especially love <33! I am not able to see the lyrics update, but that is probably because my phone is an older model. The lyrics work just fine on my computer :)",1
"The app is great but I'm having small difficulties now. After a while like maybe some weeks down, some of my downloaded songs become undownloaded and doesn't play offline so I have to go online everytime and download it again please what's wrong it's really taking alot of data and I paid for premium",0
Wanna break from the ads tap now to watch a short video,0
"When I was younger, I used to dream about being able to access music as I can now, so you could say Spotify has made my dreams come true, thank you, Rob.",1
"I downloaded Spotify after they made the sensible decision to stand up to the cancer that is cancel/woke culture & the tantrums of the has been named Neil Young. Well done, Spotify. I shall be going premium with you as a thank you for standing up against the odious cancel/woke culture.",1
"super good quality app, easily navigation and everything",1
Good app but I hate that you can't use your account on more than one device without premium,1
"Why is it that when I want to listen to a specific album by a certain artist, it plays something completely different? I'm trying to listen to ""Counterfeit Arcade"" by ""Shayfer James"", but the first song that played was ""The Fox"" by ""North Bloom""",0
"Needs more flexibilty on neing able to organize , and keep, music files in the order which user wants to.",0
Will not connect to the internet despite every other app on my phone having internet connection. Absolutely useless.,0
Great great music and a great app to work with,1
"Love Spotify.... but recently noticed that the component to pause or see current song disappears while the song/podcast is playing, I have to restart the app and play again... Hope you get to reproduce this bug, it's getting annoying ðŸ˜”. Android 12 - Pixel 5a",0
They took away the ability to listen to that short samples of a song before adding it to the playlist... :/ (REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­),0
Why can't you guys set it up so i can move it to my sd card. It hogs up too much space on my phone.,0
This is best app for listening songs online but it's a curse for free account users the no of adds are now just multiplying like now after 3 songs there will 3 ads also ðŸ˜  (but I'm giving it 5 star because it's enhance mode is ðŸ”¥),1
I thought this was the best app possible...but it has given me headache now...every two three days it ll stop working altogether! I need to clear cache thn may be clear storage or may be needs to be updated ðŸ˜žoverallso unreliable....because these issues crop of all of sudden and when not expected,0
From deleting my playlists to randomly deleting songs I add to a playlist and making me do it all over again to deleting ALL my downloads! This is the height of it. It's outrageous and frustrating especially since my network is currently horrible. I can't download songs I lost so easily meaning my subscription is useless. Ã—Ã—Ã— 2022 Second time in 48hrs that I've been logged out. I redownload the lost downloads and you log me out again. I am past angry. This is absolute MADNESS!!!,0
"You should make it easier to delete it. Absolutely ridiculous. I want it completely off my phone, not the option to update blah blah blah. Even Google play will only let me uninstall updates, I don't want it on my phone. I've tried in my settings/apps still no uninstall button. Not Cool!",0
"What the hell happened!?! I am leaving you! Premium since 2009, hundreds of playlists and 5 months ago decided to try another app. 2 weeks ago wanted to get back with Spotify. Paid and it won't load anymore. Tried clearing cache, deleting data but nothing works and can't delete the app to reinstall. Now it is ALWAYS deleting in background whilst not; instead forcing phone to crash and reset every 5-10 minutes. Not good as I courrier(Google maps). I now have a Â£10 icon that jeopardises my job.",0
"Hi,I love this app but when I play my playlist it as songs I didn't put on it also can you add a loop button I hate that I can't hear my favorite song over and over again I'm sorry if I'm sounding mean but I just want a loop button and not listen to songs that I did add to my playlist please that's all.",1
Less interruption of the music...,0
They can't let you swipe to queue a song that'd be too easy to use right? This is the gold standard for music apps but it's noticably worse than the iOS app.,0
You think it they got it.wish spotify provide hello tunes like wynk.,0
"So basically everything is ok? But umm I really have to say that whenever I just want to play a song even I click the name but the other song pop out uhhh I'm hoping they can fix this. Because it's really to listen to a song sometimes. And even u got playlist u can't play that song it have to be followed by number. The system it self keep adding other song that I definitely didn't add, that's really disturbing",0
Best music app ever and getting better. Love the synchronised lyrics!,1
"Besides the ads this would have been an home runner. Also, sometimes the app will turn off by itself and will have to turn it back on and that gets frustrating every time. If it wasn't for those two issues I would have",0
Love the music and how it works ..absolutely favorite,1
I like it the Spotify is cool,1
Works as advertised,1
BRING BACK CAR VIEW FFS. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS NOW TO DRIVE AMD USR SPOTIFY. I WON'T BE RETURNING UNTILL THIS IS SORTED. ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO GET RID OF IT. CLUELESS APP DEVELOPERS SEEMS TO BE DESTROYING THIS ONCE GREAT APP.,0
"I can't stop my playlists from shuffling & for some reason songs are starting in the middle of the music & it will not let me go back to restart them at the intended begining. I'm not sure if this is due to a bad update or patch gone wrong, but I've tried going through my settings to fix it & nothing seems to help. I've even tried uninstalling & reinstalling it. This app has become unusable and it's a damn shame, considering that it used to work really well before.",0
Remove behind the lyrics its pointless since you dont show anything besides the chorus and spends the rest of the time telling you things you really didnt gife af about and accessing the lyrics requires you to swipe up which interferes with swiping to the side to change a song which is far more important no one cares that kurt cobain had a ceasar sald before he released heart shaped box its irrelevant to what your users want to listen to the damn music,0
I'm cutting two stars from it because there's constantly ads in my playlist. Before it was quite good like I got uninterrupted listening without ads but now it's very annoying that after every song there is an ad. if the user does not want to buy the premium subscription then how can you force a user!! it's your loss only bcz after one point the user will get irritated and then download some other apps of music like I did. so better concentrate on this issue.,0
takes so long for loading even my internet is fine,0
"I've had this recurring bug, and it's become more common recently where the music controls completely disappear. The controls in notifications is gone, the bar on the bottom of the screen in the app is gone, and I can't even find any way to access the main music control screen. The only way I've really fixed this is by going to the app settings in Settings and force stopping it, but it's just really annoying. I'm paying for premium and this isn't acceptable.",0
"The only reason I don't like it is because every time I'm on it, I choose a song and it plays something else on every playlist and solo song!",0
"I joined Spotify for the music but I increasingly use it for podcasts and news shows. I have learned about many new artists and podcasts through Spotify's algorithms and I am very grateful for that. It is hard for me to imagine life without Spotify, I am on it every single day. Having said that, there are still some gaps in the music and I wish Spotify would be more proactive in closing these, instead of telling customers to contact record labels to tell them to upload an album.",0
Only platform I use to listen to my music!,1
Great music app for many genres of music,1
Spotify is totally fine but there is one problem that is many adds are annoying,0
Not sure what you guys have done but everytime I try to play it thru my headphones it is constantly going in and out (starts and stops) please fix it,0
always have what I want to hear!,1
"Recently I can't listen my offline Playlist, the songs doesn't download, and only fixes with a Internet connection.",0
"Horrible UI oversights. Have to close and re-open the app to show currently playing, if it ain't broke don't fix it!!",0
good selection for everyone in my family and at work. thanks!,1
Nice but too many ads...,0
"Too much ads, moreover ads took more around like 1 minutes, really discouraging.Always asking to go for premium.Please reduce ads time.Sometime I just open Spotify to listen music for a short time but ads always come up ðŸ™‚",0
Alot of ads,0
"It's everything you want to hear, it's memory after memory. Music is as important to your heart as it is to your ear.",1
I use Spotify for dancing it has a wide enough range to cover any kind of music I want. I also like Joe Rogan,1
I love the music on it and you can play your favorite songs I wish you play your own music of you choose,1
"I love this app but please return the option to check out the song before adding the song to a playlist, because I have to guess if it's good or not, and making playlists isn't just as fun as it used to be",1
"Annoying if you want local files on the same playlist. It turns your m4a files into mp3 which is irreparable. When returning to the app on wifi, until it loads you cannot play the current song or view your song list, You have to skip and then requeue it, which is strange because the next songs behave like downloaded files and with no wifi the list loads, so why doesn't the current song and library? The notification for currently playing songs don't appear half the time for some reason as well.",0
"Amazing recommended artists, beautiful interface, easy to use...this app has blown me away. Puts Apple Music and YT Music to shame to be honest.",1
Crashing every time after recent update kindly remove the bug.this app is nice good song collection and playback quality.thanks,1
"To quote an ad from Spotify itself, ""easy to use, highly colaborative, works on any device.."" Love ittt!!!!!",1
So far i love it...only a couple weeks and just updated so we'll see after the update,1
Best but ads are too much.,0
"They blatantly lie about the free version, making me distrust them so much I won't uograde to premium. They claim that fewer than 15 tracks on a playlist in free mode means they'll add songs to the playlist. I have >20 & they keep adding tracks, including tracks I already hid. Plus, they are STILL one of the worst in paying artists, so I'll continue to pay Apple Music despite its glitches (pays almost double). App's also not intuitive, and I won't pay extra for something misleading and greedy.",0
App is broken right now. Pauses every few minutes and the play bar goes away so you have no way to pause or skip the audio. This last update needs patched or rolled back asap. Paying premium but can't use the app for most of the month is unacceptable,0
"As someone who idiotically plays songs for months on repeat, it's thought that I can't find my repeat button anymore... Help??",0
No longer can sync with my car android auto. I fumble while driving. So dangerous!,0
Best music app and it need a small amount of internet and there is available all songs on SpotifyðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
"Used to love it. Now its a great place to visit if you're wanting to hear a few or several commercials back to back without those pesky songs interrupting you. I get having to listen to 1 or 2, like it used to be... Guess there's good reason why the stock price is 50% of it's all time high a few months ago lol goodbye spotify",1
They took away support for my car radio for absolutely no reason.,0
1. Cannot connect to Kenwood Spotify app. 2. Music quality frequently drop although I set the parameter to OFF. Fix it or I will change to other app.,0
superb experience and entertainment,1
UI is just a hide and seek game for me I am using it on Redmi Note 10pro and there are no icons in app even not next track or previous track nothing i just have to guess the position and do things everything is invisible please fix this,0
Phenomenal Any music you can think-youll find on Spotify,1
App is bugged. Player disappears from the bottom at times,0
Flexibility. Variety. Reliable.,1
"I really love this app,after I experienced the 14 free day trial it tempts me to get premium,well done Spotify.",1
I can't even open the app anymore I can't listen to music,0
"Hey, I love this app, but for some reason you can't listen to reccomended songs anymore on the ""add songs"" list. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it just doesn't seem to work anymore. Anyone else having this problem? This is the main way I discover new songs.",0
Lots and lots of bugs. Plays music even if I kill the app. Missing player bar. Can't interact with notification as previous. Very annoying. A bad user experience. Samsung s21+ android 12,0
I cant rewind songs I cant ffw songs,1
Really bad tech support and customer service. Edit: I pay for no ads and it still had ads.,0
Definitely recommended for many different people. Need to be a little more about the mood of the day and provide a better selection of sounds for different times of the day for different people. Cherry Laced DMs might help in some cases,1
"Trash, there are so many other better streaming services.",0
"Beena happy, monthly premium paying customer for a couple years. About to cancel and head to Pandora if the sudden app shutdowns and glitches aren't addressed, the widget doesn't show what's playing, poor connectivity and control through Bluetooth devices. All since the last update. Early April 2022",0
It has nice music ðŸŽ¶ and all my favorite songs,1
Broken shuffle algorithm!!!! Shuffle algorithm is so bad. Plays same set of songs in a playlist. The shuffle algorithm is not well randomized.,0
Deleted today. Spotify doesn't care about music or subscribers/users.,0
I use it on the daily and love the layout/design and usability,1
Great app for music.I thought that this was only for music but then I relised that it had stories too. The great thing about spotify is that it uses only a pinch of net.I will try my best to take premium membershipðŸ˜‚ Thanks SpotifyðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,0
"Great streaming service, especially when you get premium",1
"Shuffle Is Horrible I'm not sure when they changed the algorithms, but it's so painful to use Spotify for liked songs now. I have a 500 song playlist. I want to listen on shuffle. I don't understand why it doesn't randomize the 500 songs. Instead, it just randomizes one. You are very likely to hear the same songs on shuffle, before hearing unheard ones. PLEASE SPOTIFY BRING BACK TRUE SHUFFLE MODE.",0
The player keeps shutting down. So the music keeps on playing but I now lose my controls. Even the controls on my Bluetooth headset won't work. Have to keep hard-restarting the app which is annoying. On some occasions the player stops altogether and stops playing the music. Please fix! It was fine before the latest major UI update.,0
"It is good for the first three months then you have no control over the songs you want to play, this might be a personal problem or a public one but it is very annoying and this is a warning if this is a public issue or it is something I don't understand",0
"Playlist's Add to home screen feature don't work at all. I can't download a single song individually, I've to download an entire playlist. Consumes a lot of internet. It's removing my favourite songs day by day.",0
"CI/CD is cool until you break the app. Please put more checks in place before deploying. Will revert this review when bugs are fixed. Great data science, great music selection, great sound quality. Easily my number 1 music streaming service.",1
"Doesn't work. Songs stop whenever, app crashes constantly, song starts whenever. I pay for premium too, and this is the trash we have to put up with.",0
Great selection of music!!!,1
"Used to be a decent app, but lately it is bugging non-stop. Can't play/pause, screen freeze, skips songs randomly. Please fix this.",0
It used to work great. Now its buggy and needs internel to play the songs i've dowbloaded. Why am I paying thise?? Its not the app i used before.,0
This app is very delay for login and resso is much better then spotify ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
It is good,1
Great algorithm to figure out what I like,1
I bloody love this app. A bit buggy at times (especially offline) which cost it the full 5.,1
I really enjoy Spotify it includes all my favourite podcasts.,1
I have used spotify for 5+ years and started to have issues with it stopping randomly and not being able to start again until I restarted the app. This started a week ago and happened multiple times a day. I reached out to support. They gave me troubleshooting steps and I did them. Nothing solved the problem so I emailed back 4 times and each time I got a response from a different person giving me the trouble shooting steps. Limit on characters but it continued and never resolved the problem.,0
An amazing music experience,1
"Music keep stopping out of no way, the app is buggy as always.",0
This is one of the worst apps I ever downloaded. I tried to listen to an album but Spotify forces you to pay premium to listen in order. I don't mid the add but atleast let us choose the songs we want to play. And pls just let us listen to an album in order and not play a different song thats not on the album but from the same artist,0
Upgraded to premium for the purpose of listening to podcasts in a group with my wife while at work and you have to send the invite for her to join the group like 10 times before it finally works. Pauses and skips a lot. Sometimes it will go back a few seconds or more and repeat things. Not impressed at all.,0
Song algorithm suuuucks. Daily mixes are repteated songs. I'm done paying for a less intuitive platform.,0
They don't advertise for Spotify premium rather they beg for it.. hell of a ads seriously... They are like a beggar... After every 2 songs there's an ad.. gonna uninstall this app,0
It won't let me play the music I want it to play and it is really annoying. I try to go play the music on my favorites but it doesn't work anymore either it's a stupid update or something is wrong with my Spotify,0
Good kind,1
Use to be great for the first 2 years but lately it just turns off in the middle of songs,0
Some songs lyrics are in other language resolve and update that bugs,0
"Everything has been really good until my Bluetooth headset started glitching during playback. Went online and many people experience the same issue despite the various methods to help this like reinstalling, clearing cache etc. This is only an issue with Spotify. Please do something! It's a recent issue.",0
It lags when you open the app and takes all day to get to the search function. Then when you do search it works fine but go to the main page likes or Playlists it just lags again.,0
"spotify keeps changing songs in my playlist, im uninstalling thips app, its better to listen to on free.",0
Great selection and just what I want,1
"Used to be great, then someone made a decision to change the look and feel almost weekly. I'm dropping Spotify for this reason and going with TIDAL as my new streaming service, their Hi-Res lossless format is amazing, and the cost is just about the same. Get with the program Spotify or users will continue to drop off daily",0
Amazing sound and music selection,1
"I only switched to this app for a particular podcast and have noticed the app skipping to the end of a podcast (and onto another one) while I'm still in the middle. I tried to Google the error and it's been going on since 2019. Not a great look. And of all the settings you have, where is the disable auto play setting.",0
audio keeps going quieter,0
It would have been five but I can't download any new songs but I have the space but they won't download,0
Love the freedom of primer but I still get adverts.,1
"For standing up for freedom of speach, very well done",1
Extremely buggy and at times unusable.,0
"Used to be great, now it's all messed up. Smh why can't a good thing be left alone. Might check out prime.",0
amazing app for all music,1
this version of the app has so many bugs... so many.,0
Love this! My kind of companion and the9 SC band's as well!,1
Experience has been awful lately. The fwd/back 10 secs and pause options are missing half the time. Podcasts stop playing for no reason. Have updated 3 times with no improvement.,0
"Scam. I got premium and the app does not even work at all. How do you even manage to mess up this bad, so many things in this app don't work, even the play/pause button... DO NOT BUY I have seen small children make better apps than this.",0
The new update makes it literally unusable fix this and it can go back to five stars,0
"Randomly stops playing what I'm listening to every 30 seconds or less, it's like the adds are trying to play but it just glitches and stops what playing AND there is no ""currently playing"" bar so there is no fast forward or rewind. You can only start playing something and then pause or restart from the beginning, absolutely broken app I guess all the bug fixing funds went to Joe's contract. GLAD I never went premium, will be sticking with other, better services for now.",0
Issues with latest version. Interface extremely latent. Refuses to 'like' tracks at times.,0
I get listen to music while I'm using anther app,1
Dog poop. Doesnt play my songs. Not my liked songs. Not my made playlist. Once i downgraded they spoofed me.,0
"Loved spotify till I did an update. Literally within 5 minutes of updating its crashing, not loading, and freezing. Wish I could undo an update.",0
To much ads,0
The golden standard. Get premium y'all. It's worth it.,0
"I enjoy Spotify, not only do they offer a wide variety of podcasts, but they also have a great selection of Irish Rock music.",1
I love this app. Music is such a big part of who I am and this app is perfect to just make different playlist. They have amazing radio stations and just different vibes,1
"I honestly have a very hard time, believing that this app could actually be as terrible as it is. I am completely blown away that an app as huge as this can be THE MOST GLITCHY P.O.S. on the entire app store catalog hands down. Every developer at spotify should be fired asap! If not before.",0
Well Spotify lite ....what bulls#@ ....the only thing I like bout it ...you can record music on same volume level and that you a vast Library of music .... Not user friendly at all .... Now net Flix is simple .... Couldn't find how to download.... Then got some help ... And now can't find the music I downloaded...plus the fact that I wanna download a song not the whole freaking album..... So I uninstalled.... After I bought a premium voucher ... Now for the last hour trying to download Spotify,0
"Ever since their last upda5e I don't have the little menu you can toggle with the sing that's currently playing to fast forward/pause/ etc which is pretty annoying, music also glitches out all the time, stops playing randomly. Seems every update I'm missing another feature that use to be there...",0
"I like the new feature where it transitions from one song to the next song, I'll give u for that. Though I hope u fix your glitches",1
"Worked really well in the past. However, in roughky the last 4 months, it consistently crashes and glitches when attempting to play anything and the playback menu conveniently disappears making it even more frustrating to control the music or podcast attempting to play. Closing the app out does not always correct this issue. Used to be a great app, what happened?",0
I'm having the same problem on S20 Android. No player and no controls.,0
"its fine for music, but I can't see the lyrics at all its frustrating",0
I enjoy hereing picking songs i like,1
I love this app! Gives me all my favorite artists from grandson to Stapleton!,1
I love Spotify u can listen to music while u play games or while ur phone is off I just love it,1
"I love it!,ðŸ¤ŸðŸ½ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹ It is so easy to use, and the upgrade to Premium is AWESOME price! ðŸ’¯ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ§",1
This is becoming the worst app day by day. After 2 to 3 songs we just hear the advertisement of buying premium spotify . You even don't know how to attract the customers you are just disturbing their enjoyment. we don't want to buy the premium Spotify but still you are just adding advertisement which is disturbing the customers and I am sure that all the customers will delete this app because of this and you have already got 4.3 ratings and it will take no time to convert into 3.,0
"Bruh I have to use shuffle play or get premium to play songs in order or I can download a different app like Spotify like Pandora and have my songs play in order without premium my mom has so much on her bill with Netflix, Disney+ and HBOMAX why should my mom also pay for premium when I can use Pandora and have my songs play in order stupid mistake Spotify",0
"I absolutely love Spotify!!!!! Getting this app wasn't a waste at all! I like how I have customized playlists just for me. I was skeptical when I saw the reviews before getting the app, but now? I have no regrets! Well-done Spotify â™¥ï¸",1
"I have bad experience whenever I like to play the song, the aap is getting closed and the is stopped every time, can u pleas find a solution to it",0
what i hate in this app is I can't play a song what i want it says tap shuffle to play but its not the what i want and you only skip 6 songs (ëˆˆâ€¸ëˆˆ),0
Good app there are a few bugs it wont let me add local song to queue even tho it use to,1
"Great music, great service.",1
It's great now I can use this app at my country cause previously you couldn't connect to it,1
"I am using a SAMSUNG GALAXY A21 & I have had no issues whatsoever. I am currently using the Free Version & with so many other music apps out there & although the free version has changed over some time, you can still listen to a wide array of music with the ad break not being overly cumbersome.",1
The free version definitely isn't free? There's software engineer's that work there and those folks get paid? Excellent music platform. Thanks.,1
It's a great app at least I get to listen to music I like whenever I like ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
"Creates playlists based on what you personally listen. Creates playlists based on music you don't because hey, you might like it. Fave music app.",1
just good and fun and good to listen to songs in the background.,1
Different types of music in a single app. Good app.,1
Best music platform. Very classic.,1
It is not working properly in my vivo phone,0
"I like the app, but hate how on ONLY my phone it adds music it thinks I like while I have the playlist of my favorite songs Edit-It hasn't gotten better I think it got worse so I'm sorry spotify but until you fix this I have to lower my rating 2nd Edit-I am starting to get ads around every 1-2 songs instead 3-5 songs.....again it is normally fine on my pc and even CHROMEBOOKS(which is stupid because it is considered a phone)",0
"Awful, I keep having to uninstall the whole app jus so it will stop playing. The pause button works once or twice then stays on play. There's some great stuff on the app but the app itself is soooo bad and glitchy",0
"The app keeps having an error where it doesn't show what's playing, which means you can rewind, fast forward or pause. SO ANNOYING!!",0
Garbage dont instal this waste of time and storage,0
"All good, issues with Ultimate Ears not Spotify.",0
I enjoy using Spotify as I can choose my own Playlist.,1
I feel using spotify is much more comfortable than any other application. It's super good .ðŸ˜ŒðŸŒ¼,1
I love it. All I can say is. It has all I needed to hear. â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,1
"I Enjoy listening to Spotify and the fact that I can put. My music into into my own playlist. Also, I can pick any kind of Podcast I like. And make my own Podcast as well.",1
Very good Music App. And the sound quality is great too.,1
The best music streaming service app I have been using for ages,1
"The app's okay, and I like that I can close the app and the music can continue to play in the background. However, I can't get it to STOP playing in the background, unless I pause it. My most major issue with this app, is that, every time I try to play a song that I've already listened to before in the past, it doesn't play the song, it plays recommended songs from the recommended playlist, and I have no idea how to fix that. Also, my playlist won't play the correct songs.",0
"Almost always has the music I want, I enjoy the playlists created for me. The free version is okay as long as you have a stable connection. Had to unsubscribe for a bit due to financial reasons and the cancellation process was effortless and quick. All in all it's a great application and I will continue using it. It works well on my phone and PC.",1
"It's a wonderful app, no add, well regulated and full of entertainment and education.",1
"Right now, it is very glitchy. It stops multiple times a day. I listen 8 hours every day on the paid version. It plays without the play bar, so no way to pause or skip.",0
"Best app ever. Had never failed me, even when I don't have service!! ðŸŒš",1
Music app and it is very good very beneficial for us please don't know this and I am so happy to use this app it is beautiful and it is always relaxing,1
Closes randomly during podcasts. No clue why S22 galaxy,0
"Great app, great music but for the last month or so I haven't been able to listen without it not working when on other apps or having my phone closed and Ive never had this problem before. The reason I originally chose Spotify was bc it works in the background but now it doesnt",0
I've used apple music before... It doesn't have anything on Spotify. I love this app. I use it on all platforms.,1
"Used to love this app , then they started censoring an editing podcasts and shows that dont fit the agenda",0
Great App except can be clunky to use on Samsung,0
Amazing app for those who love music ðŸŽ¶.... But sometimes there will be some glitches... But not all the time ðŸ˜‰... If u r reading reviews to download this app then just go and download this application â˜ºï¸ðŸ‘.,1
"As a Spotify Free user, this update is very bad. In fact, whenever i create my own playlist and add songs that i love i kept pressing the 2 green arrows, it's shuffle play button won't go off. There is 30 minute clip and they wont play the entire song. Please be good to the users who are encounerting the same issue.",0
Very nice aap but adds ughhh irritating,0
Good bye take care ,1
"Shuffle play is bad, also an unreliable app!!",0
I downloaded many podcasts but when I'm offline they aren't there half the time. Also they pay the band that wrote the song next to nothing. Garbage app for garbage music companies. Get music any other way,0
Excellent love Spotify,1
"Worst app i have, takes 30 seconds to load an artists page then another 20 to start playing the audio. And you better hope a cloud doesn't make your signal hiccup or else it stops and pretends like you were never listening to it.",0
At first it was greatnow cant skipcant forward songscant do anything,1
It's a good music app but it freezes up and I have to pay to listen to songs offline witch sucks but overall it's a good app,1
"The Spotify app isn't what it used to be. Won't play songs I want, but other random songs. I dealt with commercials because it's free, but to not play the songs I want when I press play, well...",0
Excellent,1
I'm changing my review rating because I reached the max amount of pinned Playlist for my account. I think it's silly that they have a limit on how many Playlist you can pin. I have multiple Playlists that I play throughout the week but I have to search them in the search bar everytime I want to listen to them. Sometimes I can't remember the names of the Playlists so I have to scroll really far and search for the Playlist that I want to listen too. Please get rid of the Playlist pin limit! ðŸ“Œ,0
"The songs I add to my liked playlist don't add anymore, I can't scroll or pick between genres anymore, and podcasts dont play. FIX IT SPOTIFY",0
Nice,1
Its great but you already took the payment and still said the payment fails,0
It's a pretty good app but it's only three stars because instead of being ad free for 30 minutes I get an ad every two or three songs or about every ten minutes.,0
After resetting my phone i reinstalled the app and now all my liked songs are gone except a few. And yes i logged in with the same email ac.,0
"I hate this app because y'all add songs to my playlists,and I can't pick what song I want to listen to because y'all randomize it.",0
"I find this app quite good. I use it almost on a daily basis, and is very enjoyable. And for a very cheap price you can upgrade to premium and get no adds. Even with ads, it is still very enjoyable, and I highly recommend it.",1
"I love the app, but since the updated library it's been a mess in my opinion. It has not brought any comfort in use nor did it make it easier to use. I ask of you to change it back. And since a few weeks every time I use an other app with audio (for instance YouTube) and come back I have to close and restart the Spotify app because it says ""nothing is playing"" and either I can play something and not control it or not even play anything at all. This is a major frustrating factor.",0
Never used Spotify app before but with everything going. I decided to give it a shot. So far I love the app. Will try premium to show support.,1
Everything is good rather then downloading songs for which you have to purchase primium membership and you also can't stream songs on the highest quality unless you buy the membership. Edit : I've purchased the membership and the experience is flawless.,1
"Has problems playing over Bluetooth, no one seems to have an answer as to why its happening, apparently all user from all devices have the problem, and its not being addressed. Reinstalled, unpaired, updated OS, NOTHING seems to work. Tired of wasting my time!",0
"The app is super glitchy, crashes all the time, restarts podcasts all the time and the fact that it blacks out video is extremely irritating. EDIT. This app is still absolute garbage.",0
Having a problem with the gapless option. It just keeps turning off so I have to open the app every 2 songs. Please fix it!!,0
"after using Spotify on tablet for many years, coming to the mobile version is such a downgrade. so much so i deleted the app and dl my podcasts and installed all my cds on my phone. Removing Neil Young and keeping disinformation joe rogan, nothing but greed",0
Best app. It has become part of my daily routine listening to music on this app. Amazing app!,1
The only problem is when you dont have premium it gives you like 6 ads at a time,0
This app is the best music app I have ever used.,1
It is good But why I cant get Lyrics for bts songs Please check it,1
The auto play function has stopped working,0
Agree with other recent comments. The last update definitely broke some features. Current playing is not visible and cannot be managed. Frequent uncontrolled pausing.,0
Totally unusable since last update. Tried troubleshooting for days now....still getting nothing. Very frustrating Spotify and Samsung Galaxy A20!!,0
very good with all types of music to suit everyone.,1
My favorite app for music 100%,1
Worst app. Some days the app is nice and later it turns gross ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¢. If I play a song it doesn't play it takes me to an entire playlist. The app was ok before the update. The update ruined the app. Take the update back as soon as possible...,0
No. No. Adds are so freaking irrating me!!!! And you can't play your song you have to play a playlist and wait for it to come. Dang I hate it,0
"Been a customer since Spotify became available here in Norway. The app has slowly become worse, and at this point is barely useable on my fairly recent phone (s20 FE). Random pauses, play controls does not even show up. I don't really care if Android 12 inteoduced these problems, I would expect Spotify to spend less time on useless functions and more time making sure customers can listen to music. Will be evaluating other options.",0
"Glitches CONSTANTLY, pauses ALL THE TIME. Def don't pay for a paid membership. What a joke. Worst money I've spent this year. Fix your app Spotify. If I could give you 0 stars I would.",0
"I've used Spotify for years, but tried downloading it on mobile and it's just awful. I'm sorry to say it but it's just plain awful. It only lets me play songs of my choice for about 5 seconds before shuffling to recommended songs, not only that, but I can't find the repeat and shuffle buttons. I'm sorry but this doesn't even work, just use the web version instead, cause Spotify is still an excellent music provider, just not here on Google play",0
There is so many ads,0
A very nice app worth having by any loving music fan,1
I love Spotify! I use it everyday,1
The latest album art updated design with curved edges is horrifying. Pointed edges looked amazing and flat. Pls roll back.,1
"I love this app for the sake of I use it heavily since I can connect it to my console and use it on my phone as well. It has a WIDE range of music and a bunch on songs that are countless, but my problem lies within not being able to see all the songs in a album. You can see the album but the songs aren't listed to where you can see them all. Other than that it's a phenomenal music app.",1
"wish we could get premium thru google play card, also why does it play different random songs that arent on my liked playlists, its wasting my skips",0
A lot better than what I call the first and second generation Spotify 3rd generation busen,1
Locking like a hit,1
Its fun to listen to my favorite music i can also find new songs that interest me.,1
Nothing to complain its simple and I love it,1
"If you had asked me a month ago, 5 stars all the way. But the new updates are infuriating with the constant crashing. So annoying when your podcast is halfway through a sentence while youre driving and it just stops.",0
The best app for listening music,1
Very good music app,1
Why do you need so many damn ads it's ridiculous!!,0
Umm i am sorry but spotify used to be an amazing app until the recent update. I think its a bug or something because it happened to no one else. Heres the thing when i try to pause the song it would not react and when i click a playlist i get it but when i try to change the playlist it wont work. Pls fix this or i am deleting the app.,0
"The service is good but it has been experiencing serious problems while casting music on Google device like Google nest speakers, Chromecast and nest hub displays for the past six months. Either it is that ""something went wrong"" or nothing happens. I have premium family subscription and it's very annoying. Please fix.",0
Continuously stops the podcast to play its own ads and then marks that podcast played and plays a random episode.,0
Can't open after clearing catch data,0
Bes sagat mcm blh buat,1
more add,1
"It keeps getting a cache, I had to reinstall 3 times this week because it kept shuffling when I didn't want it to do that",0
I request to Spotify give us adds but dont do these kind of updates that you cant play that song againno shuffle modeno play backplay next  MUSIC IS EMOTION AND YOU ARE PLAYING WITH EMOTIONS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE  So I request to please remove all these barriers give us that old Spotify,1
Spotify is the best application to listen musics and play podcasts.Ä°t is functional and pretty easy to use.I have never experineced any tecnical problems so far and I can almost find the every song that I wish to play!Sound quality is amazing and playlist accses is more refined compared to other apps.You can convinietnly connect it to various devices and play in different platforms.I would be so glad if Spotify crew made those facilities that I mentioned more reachable for free users too:-),1
"Frustrating past few weeks... App will force close, now playing bar disappears... Saw this was a known problem, last update fixed this, but now it's back again. Makes it really tempting to switch to a different service...",0
"It wouldn't let me sign in, kept telling me I have no internet connection. Then when I did get in, after I select the episode I want to listen to, it keeps skipping through all episodes until it gets to the end of the playlist. Then it just starts playing random songs! I do not want Dermot Kennedy thank you very much..",0
New update and a new problem comes up!! Now i can't search for my playlists! Can't queue properly. Uninstalled and reinstalled and it's crashed three times on chromecast in 20 minutes! You guys really are total idiots. And now artists tracks are missing. Utterly useless.,0
this is fantastic app for old and newsing for singing,1
My player stopped working with the app I'll play a podcast and it stopped please fix asap,0
Excellent I definitely recommend Spotify,1
"WAAAAY to many issues for the last couple weeks. Spotify won't show up in the drop down, so i have to go into the app to change the music, rewind, pause etc ... Even worse, I have to force close the app frequently bc it won't display the play button at the bottom.. just a mess.",0
Can't see albums in the artists page any more,0
Awesome app that's why I am giving 5 stars without ads and clear music and number of playlists than you Spotify ...,1
I like it but you have to watch how to watch ads,1
Its really nice to listen to music without not being able to leave the app,1
Good but can be a bit confusing and difficult. Sometimes u search and play ur particular song and pops up a total different one . Spotify should really work on that,1
"New update boys! This time I can't choose how I want to join the session, so when I join someones session my phone has to blast the music too! Fun, costs battery charge, data, and I gotta turn my volume off every time, not being able to play something else. Great! #FixUrBugs",0
"I don't what happened But all of the sudden it Stop working So, i tried to restart the app but it now just show a blank screen i tried about 15 installing and uninstalling it but still won't work",0
Very best for students who enjoy studying while listening ðŸŽ¶ music at same time . Me myself is using this while studying ðŸ“– . Only add contains problem for me otherwise it's ok ðŸ‘ŒðŸ™‚â˜ºðŸ™ƒ.,1
It's a great place to listen to music and great for podcast.,1
It's a good app. But I couldn't download my playlists despite that I paid for the premium version. Still don't know why.,0
So few ads I can't rate it high enough. YouTube has started drowning me in ads and Spotify has thrown me a life ring.,0
after last update I've lost all functionality when my phone goes into screen lock. now I can't cycle through my music anymore when streaming at home or in my car... thanks for turning this app into a sack of potatoes. I'll be looking into cancelling my subscription.,0
"would be a 5* if there would be NO FRENCH ADS....sorry but as a FRENCH Canadian, the translation is very very very bad. if you compare the voices...french ones as no emotions at all. will go premium soon just to avoid listening to them, it hurts my earing! Update: may 25 2022 Also, why pay premium then press shuffle and get the same 50 songs ish on a 900+ song in library ? Waste of money for me. Bye bye premium",0
"This app has continuously been glitching to the point I can't even listen to it anymore. There is only so many times in a day that one can Uninstall and or clear cache then reinstall, log in etc. Only to have more pausing and down right no play. It often turns on by itself randomly playing things listened to in the past. It often plays without a pause or stop button. Often I can't see the video aspect. If it wasn't for The Joe Rogan podcast being exclusive to spotify, then I would of canceled",0
Has a bunch of ads SoundCloud is better,0
"What a buggy disappointment! First, it said premium has no ads and that is wrong. I subbed for the 30 day premium promo and there are most definitely ads during Rogan's podcast that I have FF to get through. Secondly, this app is so buggy! 2 times now the video stops playing and clearing cache don't work. First time I had to uninstall and reinstall and video just went out for a second time just now. So looks like round two of uninstalling and reinstalling now! Thankfully it's a free trial.",0
This is very best app for song because if you have to do some work you can play the music by this app and do that work and the song will keep going unless the mobile will lock or not,1
I hope you'll have the 'songs' where you can see all of the songs you've downloaded section so I don't have to make multiple playlist just to be able to play all of it.,1
Sometimes its stopped playing after the ad,0
Been reaching out to you since yesterday and there is no response from your side yet. Someone hacked my favourite song and replacing it with another sound. Bring Money by Lisa back. This is not the first time someone's profile has been hacked on Spotify. I would've given 0 ratings if it was possible. Fix your issues so that something like this won't happen again. Your support services is very bad. Disappointed tbh,0
"I don't know why but my spotify is really bad, somtimes I can't see what is playing, can't pause, it's just written spotify is trying to play, the app takes forever to open, I even factory reset my phone, it helped, but it's still not good",0
"Ive been using the paid version for a couple years and I love it. But recently the currently playing bar at the bottom has dissappeared and it really takes away from the whole experience. Most of the time when I am really enjoying a song I just click the heart to add to my liked songs. But now I have to try to find out what song it is on google? Just so I can then come back to spotify, search it, click on it (which restarts the song) and then Im able to add it to a playlist. That's some bs :(",0
The amount of value I get out of the service is remarkable. The app has a lot of really neat features.,1
"Seems as if they updated the shuffle for specific artist. Will actually stick with the artist you selected for more than 6 songs, so that's an improvement. But these 5adds in a row? Uninstalled, long time user off and on premium. But that is just rediculous for free user IMO. Atleast have some decent targeted adds. RIP spotify.",0
"Why it keeps crashing now when I play a song, I already tried restarting phone and reinstalling the app, it didn't fix",0
There is a issue with the app the player doesn't show up I need to restart the app to be able to change the music or stop the player.,0
"How hard can it be to fix the constant stopping of the song/podcast? Did someone in some meeting just said ""fÃ¼Ä‡k Ã®Å¥, we will sell it like that""",0
"Lately my Spotify has been glitching. It will suddenly play but have no controls so I can't skip the song, pause, anything. I have to go in and force close it to get controls back.",1
Best for music,1
excellent music app,1
My playlists don't play the songs in my list,0
Amezing app...â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ Better than any other music app,1
One suggestion: Add shuffle and repeat buttons to the mini player in lock screen,0
You know I had this app for a few years now and I'm not sure why they got rid of the canvas for the background for some songs I wish I had that back,0
It's very easy to use and the good thing is that you can do other things on your phone without stopping the music!,1
Superb music selection~Fully enjoy all my stations,1
"So long as you keep Joe Rogan's podcast active and uncensored, I will be sticking around and supporting Spotify. Joe's podcast is really the only reason why I came to Spotify to begin with, given that before, I woud listen to his discussions on YouTube but then they decided to start chopping his conversations, taking things out of context, and of course, removing certain discussions based on no other merit than they simply didn't like the content. That's why I am here. Stay strong Spotify Team!",0
It is better to view song script in their own language like telugu song in telugu script,0
Fun fun fun!,1
I hate this app because every time you go to listen to a song it goes to an advertisement and then it's trying to get you to sign up for a damn premium offer so I uninstalled this app,0
"I've been using Spotify for 10 years, I could not imagine a day where I don't enjoy this service. â¤ï¸",0
Lots of really good options and variety,1
"Right song won't play, I'll tap the song I want to play and another song starts playing. I absolutely despise it. As well as the fact that all of a sudden I can't loop my songs anymore. The button's just not there.",0
"Amazing, it's the one I was looking for a long time, fulfilling expectations.",1
"So far so good, just miss local South African music.",1
"Idk why but whenever i play something the app just crashes. I've tried restarting my phone, even uninstalling and reinstalling the app nothing seems to work",0
So at last..... I have made my decision of uninstalling your fed up and just irritating app.. Going for some other app.... Dont understand how for can anyone go to purchase a premium membership....... You will loose many users like this....,0
If I don't have premium and I try to listen to the songs on my playlist it playing songs that are not on the playlist. I would suggest that you fix that so that we can just listen to the songs on our playlist than listening to something that is not on the playlist,0
"I love listening to the podcasts without them being overly censored. I'm a grown adult and can recognize the difference between misinformation and agenda, but I still want to hear the entire story",1
Love â¤ ðŸ˜ ðŸ’– this app follow almost anything you can think of brilliant,1
I have already logged in but everything has got logged out and it is not sending a new link,0
Works well as advertised. Brilliantly synchronizes across all platforms and devices.,1
"I deleted my previous review because I assumed that the problem was user error on my part. I cannot rewind my podcasts on the phone because the screen that allows me to move the progression slider never pops up and I don't know how to make it come up manually, regardless of how many times I open or close the app, or access the podcast or even the specific episode I'm watching. How is anyone supposed to even understand Joe Rogan's BS, if you can't go back and relisten to comprehend?",0
"Love the App. Offline setting must be on homepage and downloaded music be easier organized, all in an effort to be able to play your music when offline!",0
All the songs ever made. Or most of them..,1
"One night I just turned on Spotify, when it said my free trial was up... The one I diden't even ask for. I was ok with it untill I saw my playlist. The only option was ""shuffle"" I couldn't even listen to the songs in order! I tried to, and whenever I clicked on the names of the songs listed out, and would only let me hear a clip. I need music to go to sleep. The ads where loud even though I had my volume down. Still anoyed, the layout is WAY to complicated if you don't have primium.",0
Never works after some time being inactive. I always have to kill te app and restart it to work.,0
Excellent sound and great variety of songs ðŸŽµ ðŸ‘Œ,1
"Love Spotify!! I have discovered so many artists, bands and songs by checking out the artist of a song I like. So easy to go real deep in checking out different levels of an artist.",1
The best music app.,1
Devs: what did you do to Spotify connect? The new update has a huge lag or is unresponsive when controlling other devices.,0
"Doesn't play the song I want to play. 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening after irrelevant commercials? Nope, it plays some random song that I cancel and try playing my song,, but the same random song comes up so I back out which makes the same commercial play and still doesn't play the song I want to listen to. Then immediately plays commercials AGAIN if I back out to try to listen to the song I wanted. And still doesn't play my song. If you fix this, I would consider a paid subscription.",0
this app ossam and really grateful for me to learn english so many poadcasts and aii best booksare here availaiblei love it app ðŸ˜â˜ºðŸ˜‡,1
"Cant search even when online cos it days ""Go online to search again"" even when it is playing songs. Very frustrating experience. So frustrating i even use youtube misic now",0
It won't support mobile payment. even there is enough balance + taxes needed,0
90% of my usage the app doesn't allow me to select songs all I can do is shuffle and then I can't skip or have any control over play and pause. The control bar doesn't appear,0
"If you dont have premium, you cant play any of the songs you want, i really want to play some songs but i really cant. Please fix this.",0
I appreciate the weekly updates but can you ACTUALLY FIX ISSUES,1
Best,1
I love paying $10 a month for a barely functional app. Right when it starts working they update again and break the whole thing. Thanks spotify,0
Besides the free music. It has terrible navigation. I cant play a specific song from a playlist. Either that or the features are well hidden,0
"My app isn't opening for some reason, fix the bugs asap or I'll die for depression.",0
Love it Has all the different types of music I listen to,1
"Spotify is as close to digital garbage as the internet can produce. You can't even pick your own song without premium. Just feels scummy to be told, ""no you don't get the song you clicked on cuz this is actually an album also here's country music not even related to your original search""",0
Wow man this app is more better than gaana. We can not only hear songs we can also hear podacasts I love this app literlly well done developers keep it up ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ,1
Love the playlists,1
I like Spotify but I wish it was easier to stop adding songs to my Playlists. Why can't we thumb down? Or am I missing it.,0
Pls fix this because when I use and I want listen to the song it make hard if want listen if not premium so please fix this,0
"I lost all of my Playlists and I can't figure out how to retrieve them. My everyday phone has my music but my phone that just have Spotify, no music. But both phone are on the same account.",0
Why can't I view the podcast when I'm connected with my Bluetooth speaker??... its like trying to avoid me driving and watching it but the problem is that I am not driving! Why does it decide automatically for me and I dont have the option to opt out of this stupidity of a feature.,0
K VISION PUBLISHING ASCAP,1
Lyrics are not available in any song.,0
"Totally love it, specially in the summer time.",1
"Easy navigation, almost complete selection. Spotify is the best.",1
"It's a good app, don't get me wrong, but I just hate the recommended songs feature that randomly plays. I only listen to songs in Spanish but for some reason this app decides that I would love to listen to Justin Bieber and country music. I don't understand why it plays songs that I don't want to listen to.",0
"If Spotify had an option that allowed songs to crossfade when a user manually changes the song, I think that would be the icing on the cake.",0
"Great app for all music, old and new, with features that make it fun.",1
"Excellent app, perfect app for any beginner or advanced music listen or hoarder",1
"I enjoyed this app, listening to music while I worked on my research, data analysis and publications as an Emergency Manager and Environmental Scientist, but then the company decided to give a platform to anti-science podcasters, that give dangerous health and safety advice. I have found a better streaming app without the fluff and propaganda.",0
The app used to be perfect but for the past months the queue feature has been completely messed up. It keeps deleting what I add to the queue. With every update I hope this will get solved but it doesn't.,0
Very Nice User Experience compared to other music apps!,1
absolutely love listening to Spotify but u need to get rid of the adverts they are annoying and nobody needs them,0
This is the best music player ever but sometimes I can't download music using cellular data but still it's a five star for me cause I love it ðŸ˜,1
"The app steals focus and immediately starts playing as soon as you open the app. Did I want to just put a song I heard elsewhere into a playlist, while continuing to listen aduio from something else? Too bad! Also, they broke the They Might Be Giants album Apollo 18. That's more of a service issue, but given aggressively unresponsive they are to fixing the issue, I don't feel bad docking them points",0
One of the best music app I ever seen. I hope everyone enjoys like me.,1
"What happened to pause/play on android? Tried to find answer on settings, nothing there. Spotify officially sucks now!",0
I would like to have the option to repeat a song as many times I want.,0
App does not give me the song I want is extremely difficult to use rather opt for deezer,0
Are you guys planning on losing all your subscribers before you address this annoying Bluetooth problem?,0
"Too many bugs. Listening to podcasts and it doesn't save my place. Have to search thru to find where I left off, every time. Some times it doesn't bring up the player when I hit play then I can't pause. Have to force stop the app to stop audio. Terrible.",0
I already upgraded my Spotify but i still don't have the lyrics,0
Nice application for song lover.,1
It's good to listen the music continuously,1
Spotify is good platform music,1
Awesome App for listening to songs...Has a vast collection of songs and is available for all platforms..which makes it very easy to use.. Android app has bugs though..!! Doesn't work on my Wi-Fi sometimes.. Hopefully the pesky bugs are removed ASAP...,0
"Awsome app,great sound quality,huge catalogue",1
I've found a lot of songs that I haven't heard in a long time some that I had even forgotten about.,1
There are ads that are of 30 secs and take to long and tells the same thing only that part I don't like about this aap,0
Nice and free music app,1
First of all the app is nice and sound quality is good but there are so MANY ads + you can't load lyrics of some songs :/,0
Overall good experience nice interface I am totally satisfy with spotify every experience but if you reduce 1 month charges 89 rupees genuinely i am glad and It's become a more good option for music lover and I will recommend,1
No matter what I did it would NOT let me un-shuffle my songs. Is it to hard to let me listen to the song I want to listen to?? And it's stupid how I can only skip 6 songs.,0
Why is there no option to disable shuffle in 'discover weekly.' there used to be but there isn't anymore. Are you people mentally constipated? Why remove a feature? Damn programmers are pure dumb sometimes.,0
This is because Spotify keeps forcefully adding songs to my playlist that I don't want and limits my skips to 6 even though I don't want those songs . Please remove your recommendations as they aren't needed. Thank you,0
Very good! Love the music!!!,1
Listening music on this app is so spectacular.,1
The suggestion according to my mood is amazing.,1
Aanoying keeps stopping and keeps asking for Bluetooth??,0
"Perfect app, just the shuffle setting isnt really random, it cycles between the same ' randomised ' songs. Out of like the 3k liked songs I have, I get the same 10 songs on shuffle, it's kinda annoying when you don't know what to listen to or you're just trying to listen to some music you forgot about.",0
It gets irritating when you look up a song where want to play your playlist and and music you don't have on the playlist where the songia woke up doesn't play but other songs do because it's song spotify thinks You would like I am trying the 3 month Samsung trial I trial which I don't even know what it's for because it won't let me skip songs and let's we have ads And it doesn't even allow me to listen to my playlist without the songs that are added by spotify.,0
"This app used to be great but now I can't use it no matter what I do. One day it was fine the next it would crash every time I tried to open, then I updated the app when I could and now every Playlist, mine and the Spotify made ones, all say empty. No matter what I do I cannot listen to anything or see any music at all. Very disappointing.",0
Best app for listening to your favorite music artists love it But it asks for premium after skipping 6 songs ðŸ˜ž.but all good,1
"Previously 4 stars, now 3 due to the controls no longer showing on the lock screen of my phone so I constantly have to unlock to change songs. Using headphone controls seems to scramble the songs now (tried multiple pairs, it's not the headphones). Playlist doesn't always pick up where you left off so after it's scrambled, then paused, you have to restart the playlist even if you know the song you were on. Just feels messy now",0
Can't choose which song you want to listen to without it being in a playlist and can't skip songs you don't want to listen to without getting premium. Very cringy app.,1
Love this app man. Van Halen fan since 1980 when I was 12 and fir life bud! Best collections of 80s hard rock I've seen. I'm an 80s rock guru and this app is top notch. ðŸ‘Œ,1
"Excellent application for listening to the music of our choice ! I haven't seen such a large collection elsewhere . Dr.T N . Kumar ., Bengaluru ,South India .",1
Supports medical misinformation and the use of racial slurs. There are better music and podcasts apps so be a good human being and skip over this one.,0
The app is sooo amazing you can listen to music while your phone is off or play a game and listen to music download this app,1
It is good but too many ads they stop me many times and if I get a better app than this I will delete Spotify,0
The app is absolutely atrocious. It regularly bugs out if put into offline mode or just randomly will stop making any sound when playing music.,0
"I hear music.... just not on this platform anymore. They need to turn up the Security and Responsibility, also needs to stop selecting songs I didn't want to listen to. Unless I've already asked for random choice. Otherwise it's useful for the masses. Could be better. Should be.",0
My experience was great until I knew that I cannt forward and backward the songs  And the ads was irritating  I love this app,1
Always buggy. Now it can't detect devices to cast to. I wish I could go lower than 1 star.,0
Trying to open but it's not using my password,0
"The new update sucks and has lots of bugs. App won't stop playing music even after it's been closed, play bar doesn't show up half the time, stops playing music randomly. Please fix",0
Spotify is a great app fro music you can search any song and find it along with it artist its really amazing and I love this app.its really amazing,1
The contoller at the bootom is not visible. I dont have the pause or next buttons. May 30 problem is the same,0
Super app add new songs please ðŸ™ðŸ™,1
"Why wont the app connect with my car deck anymore. Its disappointing to say the least, especially when i use it so regularly. Please fix or give me tips thanks",0
Was great for a while then then it started stopping after about 30 seconds to a minute of play. It's ridiculous . Going back to Pandora,0
Its a shame how many bugs Android users are facing - there's nothing more annoying than having to reset the app everytime the playing bar disappear or when it just pause randomly. The worst thing is that I even pay for this...,0
Love it! Can find most any song title or artist. Can customize playlists. Discover artists I'm unfamiliar with via recommendations based on my preferred music styles. Great app.,1
Some songs get deleted for no reason But overall Spotify is good,1
Spotify has gotten me through 9 formidable years of my life It is my go to music streaming service and it has helped expand my music taste palette Never any advertisements with premium Spotify Wrapped something I look forward to most every year I love making a new playlist for every month,1
"I love the music they have on there and love how you can integrate audios saved on your phone to your Playlist. Premium is a absolute necessity and would overall 10/10 recommend using Spotify and would recommend premium even more, it's cheap and worth your dollar for all kinds of great music, podcasts, ect.",1
"Paying for premium but seem to be getting the free version, no ability to shuffle music, skip songs, fast-forward podcasts and it stops completely every 10-15 minutes so annoying during workouts. constantly having to restart the app or restart my phone to get the app to reset.",0
The Best music steaming service,1
Very annoying and disturbing,0
Its was good till it started adding songs to my personal playlists and I couldn't even get to the songs I like because you can only skip 6 songs per hour,0
Really great. Love that I can make individual play lists,1
"My fav music source- in the car and at home, meets all the needs and adding to playlists is super easy",1
The best app ever I can listen all songs here no matter which language plus I can see most of the lyrics here soooo mine one and only favorite app is Spotify I love it,1
I've been using this app for months now and I've never had problems in it. I'm so glad I found this app. It's the most perfect app ever!!!,1
APRIL 5TH VERSION IS BROKEN IN ANDROID AUTO. HAVE TO RESTART APP EVERY SINGLE TIME I CONNECT TO CAR.,0
easy and fast access has all the songs I love and,1
Amazing app with premium,1
Good over all. Nice selection to choose from,1
More problems than any other streaming service. Even Deezer is more reliable.,0
"works when it wants to. controls dissappear, music cuts out every few seconds. it's been months on 2 phones. waste of time and money at this point. note 10+ and s22 ultra.... needs an update to fix this.",0
"Spotify is a great app,I Think We All Sgoyld Have It.",1
"A must have for anyone who enjoys music an podcasts but are not able to find everything in just one streaming service... another algorithm, different suggestions... I've found I was running out of space on my phone and Spotify was filling almost 5 GB of files ?! I didn't downloaded any song, only listened to via streaming. So I uninstalled de app and tried the lite version, it works OK but has no lyrics option there and for some songs is a desirable feature... So giving another try...",0
when im playing through radio or the song that being played after I selected a song through just searching it- it just routes me the songs that I usually play and not something new :( some are even from my downloads. can u pls fix this?,0
Latest update is a lemon. I can't see what song is playing or skip back and forward and during playback it cuts out and plays nothing for 5 or so seconds. I pay for Premium and this is very frustrating.,0
Automatically playing stop,0
Music is th life n Spotify is th best app to listen th music,1
Great experience I like music collection and sound quality,1
They have all my favorites songs,1
I love this app,1
Garbage app. Couldn't find podcasts and searching for podcasts is mindnumbingly difficult. Instead it will show songs with the same name as the podcast ðŸ™„. Uninstall this $hit and install SoundCloud to save yourself a headache.,0
LOVE,1
"Pretty good, not great. Hate how when you select the song you want to play, it'll play random songs in a play list your song may be in, forcing you to skip, then forcing you to watch ads",0
"One of the best music app ever I really recommend it. But there is something the ads are really annoying but in some ads there is like ""You will get 30 min ads break"" like that and I'm really happy and you can even the lyric. I highly recommend itðŸ’“ðŸ¤—",1
"Wish I could rate this junk lower. Garbage app, pauses, fails to load sometimes, full of ads, freezes, limited revenue for artists, trashy interface etc.",0
Please tell me how to stop the app from turning itself on as I'm driving!! nothing like music randomly blaring to cause an accident! Really opening yourself up to a lawsuit spotify.,0
I love the fact that Spotify doesn't censor content on their platform. Allowing for conversion and open dialog between adults.,1
Best music app everrrrrrrrrrrðŸ˜,1
Too many ads .,0
One bug: I click my music and random song is there :(,0
The free trial is great and when thats over there are only a few adds that x o me between you are your music.ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ŒðŸ¤ŒðŸ¤ŸðŸ‘,1
Its a very fun thing to listen to while u r playin a game,1
This app is very good in searching for music but tooo may ads sometimes,0
"I was excited to download this app; music is a LARGE contributor in setting my mood for any situation. Unfortunately, I quickly became disappointed with the Spotify app as I was reading the reviews. In all fairness, I did only read the first 10-15, but it was enough to decide at this time Spotify is not for me. The majority of the reviews had 1 star, and a couple had 2. I appreciate everyone's honesty! I'm not giving up just yet; I'll keep watching for better reviews. Thank you!",1
Fabulous ,1
The great music you really want to hear!,1
Why would I want people on my wifi network controlling what comes out of my headphones? When I go to turn this new feature off it just says it didn't work,0
My premium doesnt work and i tried everything already but it wont work.,1
Enjoy having the ability to hear what I want and the weekly mix is awesome for finding music I haven't heard before or have forgotten about,1
Very easy to use and to make play list. Lots of great podcast.,1
Recently the app has started crashing and having numerous play back issues also if you want to make sure artists make more emoney than Spotify and Sony try Napster or tidal.,0
"It's a pretty good app, except I'm now going to delete it, and Uninstaller it!!! As soon as you join the cancel crazy, censoring mob, I won't keep it to help the CEO make money. I will make sure all my friends amd family, Uninstaller and delete it as well!!",0
It's done me well and I just like the way it's set up.,1
is this music and podcast app or ads app every two or one songs there is three ads and I am not available to buy any subscription of spotify and any app. Please reduce ads on Spotify.,0
"It's a good app, but all the sudden when I'm listening to podcasts here lately, it's been jumping to the next episode on its own, and I'm having to go back to the previous episode and find my place. It's getting old because it just does it randomly.",0
Absolutely the best thing ever to listen to music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ ðŸ™Œ ðŸ‘ â¤ï¸,1
You could add option for people who wants to listen music or songs at the same time in different places to have a great vibe please note it and make an update,1
I've had Spotify for a few years. I love it,1
Spotify's shuffle will have you listening to the same 7 songs in a playlist of over 100 songs.,0
Keeps crashing and is very slow when offline mode is selected,0
This app is really good for music it has a ton of songs on it but I'm the adds are kinda annoying but over all it's a good app,1
The UI is very hard to use like a simple drop down menu should have directly download option as we have to forcefully download the complete album instead of priority songs as well such kind of more simple UI is required,0
"Was great, but now after I listen for an hour or so I lose the player controls. They just aren't there at the bottom of the screen to open them up at all. This started when spotify started asking to directly connect to Bluetooth devices. I accepted that at first and this started. But even if I deny that permission (which it asks for every time I open the damn app) it keeps doing. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times. Happens every time after about 3 days. FIX THIS!",0
Teh best The ginchiest Spotify is the Tops ,1
Perfect app to listen music.i appreicait that you put a lot of work into theme. it has beautiful design and having great sound quality makes spotify the best music app ever.,1
"Good app, doesn't let me unhide songs for some reason",1
"Currently the app randomly stops the music, and doesn't load the bar!",0
"Please stop adding songs to my playlist ðŸ™ , you are ruining my day with those songs",0
App keeps crashing when in use.,0
Very great app I listened to the batman theme a lot,1
Amazing music platform,1
"I like it easy to handle,",1
"Spotify is probably the best music streaming app out there, but there's just one problem. When you say 30 minutes of free listening, does it mean 30 minutes with or without an ad? I get you guys are about monetization and are probably greedy for people's money but do that honestly. Other than that I have no complaints. It's just that a silly ad pops up during my ""30 minutes of free listening."" Fixing means they're 5 stars in my book.",0
The best app for listening to music. But since the last month they are literally annoying the hell of out of everyone by showing ads after every song ðŸ˜‚. Neithertheless I got Spotify premium and it's so good. I love it. The enhance feature on playlists is just *chefs kisses*.,1
"Love Spotify. I switched from Pandora and I'm infinitely happier with what I have now. Highly recommend. I never had the free with adds version, but for me it's worth every penny to get the music I want.",1
Best choice if you can't live without music,1
The superior music and podcast streaming app.,1
"Been okay so far nothing to rav about just the UI needs a update it's clunky and sluggish, lack of long press for options is soo 2012 UI/UX designs I'm not even going to go into the home page it's just a mess please clean that up somehow How does a music player not have a play next button?? ðŸ¤” Or Custom playlist cover if the app is set up to use playlists as the main method",0
I regret downloading this app. YouTube music is a lot better. I don't understand why I am listening to a song I'm not able to prepare fora song that I would like to play next. I have to scroll throuh My list of songs and then wait for the song to finish and then press the next song. YouTube music doesn't do this. Also I hate the exit button on this app. I have to go and manually press one of the symbols on the app for me to get out of a certain song instead of just pressing the back button,0
"Some of the songs stops in the middle of the track. Their ads are all about only premium membership and even you change the track, they play ad for changing track also. Some playlist are not as the playlist description.",0
Y I can't play any songs just now I played a song but automatically app closed no songs are playing what mistake here...pls correct it,0
No matter how many times I make it to where there Spotify can play in the background it always shuts off and now I can't even listen to Spotify unless my phone is on the app and left turned on,0
It is very good for music and podcasts,1
"I think this is the app for which I was looking for a long ""the best app"" my fav music even tunes and different options I don't care of ad I just love this app thanks for such wonderful app love you Spotify every song lover must download this if you feel problem with ad just take the subscription dude the smoothest song playing app thanks. Saranghea ðŸ’œ",1
Love it just wish the free account had a few less commercials other then that love it,1
I would give it 5 stars but dor some reason it never plays the specific songs I want please fix this,0
I'm still a member of Spotify & have been for over 17yrs so that speaks for itself. I so love the Northern Soul tunes but there is a vast choice of music to choose from. Maybe they will give me a free subscription for being such A good and loyal customer... LOL,1
I hate it it's full of ads I can't listen to the songâ˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
Iam giving a big star,1
It has Rogan and almost as much music as YouTube. Irritating amount of notifications and emails sent almost everyday or a few times a day to get the paid version. Wish I didn't need it for my favorite podcast but I'm happy he got his bag so it works out.,1
Too much add can't stop add need to buy premium package for ad free music such a pathetic experience,0
Offline mode doesn't actually work. Don't bother downloading through Spotify. There's sites that let you rip your playlist and actually download it,0
Everything is good but your premium adds There is no skip option we have to listen adds till end and dont have option to proceed backward or forward I hope your team as soon as recover this problem that I face,1
Keep JRE. I'm signing up for a subscription just bc media is trying to cancel JRE. If Spotify removes him. I'm cancelling Spotify. Thank you Spotify.,0
"Ideal for listening to music, at home, office, or when travellling. Fantastic",1
"I enjoyed the app for the first two weeks. It didn't suggest anywhere that I was on some kind of free trial. It then prompted me for a review, and I gave a good rating. Afterwards, it started to play ads and contained way less functionality. That's fine, and it's a reasonable app. But it was quite a disappointment after how it started.",0
Love the podcasts Ive been listening to,1
Nice music and I'll die for spotify,1
The music on this is great. It even plays if your phone is off or on something else! I would recommend using this app if you want to listen to premium music.,1
This app is really good if u have premium but if your not looking to pay its probally not the best because if u search a song u will have to wait for the 4th 1 to be yours but u only hqve 6 skips an hour,0
"Way better than I thought it was. Shouldve got it sooner,and it's cool how some things have videos too.",1
I really like this app but the ads are more,0
I am giving it 4 stars because it has problem that when I play music from my playlists it doesn't played plz look into this issue. And this app is very good for music . And I am deleting this app until issue resolved,0
"Get over the adds and it's a brilliant app. EDIT, FEB 4th 2022 Well some time later and I pay the monthly fee ðŸ˜Š , I must eat my words and admit that I enjoy music too much to have it interrupted. â‚¬9.99 per month is great value, in my opinion for the price of 3 to four cups of coffee for a month's musical enjoyment ðŸ‘",1
"App has recently started pausing on its own, currently playing is frozen so can't pause or skip forward/back etc.",0
"This app totally sucks, i only have it 2days in my phone and now i hate it.whenever i play a song i lt automatically shuffles the song.",0
"Frequent crashes, also I pay for the premium and still get advertising for the JRE!? Still better then pandora but maybe not worth buying.",0
#NAME?,1
Spotify Android version Sucks! Not user friendly at all...Too many damn ads ðŸ˜  Don't install this trash on your device... PC version of spotify is 100 times better than this ðŸ˜’,0
"I love Spotify ,,,it's my favourite app of all time ðŸ‘",1
"The app continues to be unable to pause. Have to open app, go into the player and tap it 2 times for it to react. Its been happening for about 2 weeks. Before you updated the app in November it worked perfext. Like to add its racist and supports conspiracy theories!!",0
Best music app I have ever used no bugs and no problem nice music quality and every artist keep it up guys but one problem please free the download section,1
"My Spotify app would open but, when I try to play a song of podcast it would get shut. tried reinstalling the app but still facing the same issue. Hope you can help me solve the issue.",0
"I only got up here because I listen to the Joe Rogan podcasts, so that's all I have to go on, however I have searched around a bit, and I like what I've seen. I'm gonna do some more diggin. So to the people of Spotify, top marks, top marks",1
Simple and user-friendly,1
just cant explain its amazing 1010 do recommend,1
If we can't download the songs for free then delete ur nonsense appðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
"Please add annual subscription, the monthly subscription is really annoying, if you don't add annual subscription, I'll shift to Spotify mod version",0
Had my account for years.....and now sonce the last update ....The app is glitchy as hell.now.....Please fix this,0
Very good app,1
"Crashes every few minutes, you cant even go through a full song without it crashing, incredible amount of ads and little skips force you to buy premium, you can just use some free app and download your own songs. Hard gui to navigate, especially on phone. Would not recommend anyone ever.",0
"It keeps saying that im offline even though my wifi works fine, i even switched to my mobile data and nothing happens. Sometimes itll just tell me to try again or that my playlists dont exist. Its kinda annoying since i use spotify a lot",0
Great music platform,1
I've been having this issue for two weeks now. I can't log in on the Spotify app but I can using the Lite version and in browser. When I try to log in to the app it says my account is offline even though I have internet connect and when I try to log in using email link it says the link is expired even though I was just seconds ago when I received it.,0
Ads literally EVERY 2 SONGS why so many ? Not everyone can pay just to listen to songs without ads especially students like me. Atleast make a skip ad button or the ads more short an rare. Everything else is amazing,1
What is up with this new version!!????? Why am I now unable to stop my music without force stopping the app????the pause button no longer works ...I loved this app and am a premium member...but am seriously thinking of ending my subscription.,0
Good,1
I love it the app but the only thing bad is like 12 ads just to hear a song,0
I enjoy music alot so i uuse sptifyevery day.,1
Love â¤ the way the music is selected.,1
"Bar none the worst app I have ever used. This app randomly stops, won't shut off or just won't respond in general. I thought the ""premium"" experience would be better so I bought in. It's just not any better. This is the same for both my phones. It does not matter if I reinstall or clear my cache (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place). Don't invest your time in this app. Certainly don't give them money. I can't even listen to my podcasts.",0
"Each time theres an update, it's a gamble to whether it breaks the app or not. Currently it's broken! Songs will stop playing, can't see what's playing half the time, selecting a song won't even play the song. No excuse for the quality of the app.",0
"Weâ€™re always making changes and improvements to Spotify. To make sure you donâ€™t miss a thing, just keep your Updates turned on.",1
Its stuck in shuffle play and cant get rid of it fix this,0
Every time I try to listen to my favorite songs the app plays maybe one or two of my songs then starts playing a bunch of songs that I don't like and it won't let me go back to my songs. This is very frustrating.,1
Excellent includes lyrics I am hook goodbye iTunes there's a new sheriff in town..,1
App won't open. Just crashes,0
Very good and easy to use.,1
"Intuitive interface easy to use and understand. Some clever features, set up for more social interaction than other sites.",1
"The ads are so annoying, especially the fact that they play at a higher volume than the music does",0
"Very happy with Spotify I can listen and search with all the music I liked, good sound quality and easy to use.",1
You got me hooked on Spotify after being faithful to Pandora for about ten years. I never knew what I was missing. The ease of use and depth of music is far superior here.,1
Add Rupay for payments too ....... Not every countries have these American platforms of payments.,0
"When I go to make a playlist I used to be able to just click on the song and I can preview it before I add it, which made making playlists way easier. Now they took that away and I might just switch over to something else because this is bs.",0
At times while playing the app it shows Internet connection not available while all other apps are working.,0
"It's easy to use,also can write different language.",1
Too much ads. Wrost app,0
Just love the vibes and ui of this app. Plus the audio quality and music recommendations and the overall user experience it's top tier. Just love this app,1
"I have been listening to SPOTIFY for more than 3 years now... I can always count on them for whatever mood I am in... Therefore, SPOTIFY never failed to deliver nor disappoint me... Truthâ™¥ï¸... (so I ask that this app will not fail us now...)",1
i hate the suggested songs this would be 5 stars if you remove the suggested songs PLEASE REMOVE SUGGESTED SONGS,0
"The layout/design and features are amazing, though the ads get annoying. Good music quality",1
First time using it. Love it's variety and rich sound!,1
"Navigating Podcasts is such a hassle. You scroll down a podcast, find a podcast and add it to your playlist. Then it goes right to the top. So you have to scroll down again.",0
Queue doesn't work sometimes. Oftentimes the control panel doesn't show up on the notification bar. Podcasts don't update regularly. Appears to be programmed by literal infants. Why tf am I even paying 10 bucks for this unreliable buggy mess ?! Edit: New Update came out. Didn't fix a thing. Still terrible. 2nd Edit: New update. Zero fixes. It's getting ridiculous y'all...,0
It gives me peace of mind.i play whatever music which comes on my mind,1
"The best music app. Only complaint,, They need to pay garth brooks whatever he is wanting for his music to be avaliable",1
Solid. Very enjoyable.,1
My problem has been solved. Thank You spotify India. I love it.,1
This is a awesome app  Percent,1
A brilliant app especially for self development podcasts,1
It's a worst app of music ever tried I think Spotify should be improved. Spotify is a stupid music app it should be rated 0.05.,0
"Spotify is the only app on my phone I open most days, I'm not sure how many hours listened to riot grrl / punk music but it hits the spot. covers all bases. and I wouldn't be without it.. I double date Al these mobile phone manufacturers to stop messing around with cameras its just old and lame and put better audio and louder speakers hell yeah.",1
Loved this app before But after this premium thing came in between everything changed literally EVERYTHING ,1
"i would'av given a 5*, but since i'm relatively new to the spotify scene , i thought it disingenuous , there's always room for improvement in anything we do.., keep up the good work, and i might, this review, to edit, come back. ðŸ˜‰",0
"How are international artists with the same name getting grouped as the same artist. For example, this is a current one....hi tek, from Cincinnati one half of reflection eternal thees another group or person from China also named hi tek on spotify and you've smashed their music together. They are not the same artist! This is not the first time I've seen this and I have no where to report this as a consumer. You'll get your stars back when you address this. edit: spotify doesn't care.",0
"Thank you for helping me ,I have BPD a personality disorder where regulating my mood is incredibly difficult and distressing ,the music on repeat and at any time at the touch of my fingers and just my favorite songs it has helped me stay safe so often thank you",1
Excellent,1
This Is An Amazing App I Love It Helps Me To Listen To All My Favorite BTS Songs And Sing Along With The LyricsðŸ¥ºðŸ’œ,1
My Spotify app has stopped working completely. Can't play a song. Every playlist is shown as blank screen. Please solve it. I need Spotify.,0
"Fix the app! Keeps crushing, plays what ever it wants, doesn't react, if I want to switch it off I need to close it from the background.",0
I am an android app developer and I'd like to say that Spotify is the most fantastic app I've ever used. Thanks for making it. ( I have the premium version btw if anyone's concerned ),1
Literally none of my songs in my playlist are playing its only random songs that I didn't ask to hear i don't wanna hear it just let me listen to what's in my playlist.,0
"If you want to discover new music than this app is for you. Because it will add to your Playlists, it does not give a choice in the matter. I understand what they were meaning when they did this but it can get annoying. If they fixed this I would like it more.",0
Excellent service and great song choices,1
"Amazing, best music platform app available.",1
I tried listening to one specific song but instead get random stuff it was so annoying and this happens for a lot of stuff,0
I love music it's always been a passion for me before trying Spotify I had tried probably every music app that was available and none of them are anywhere close to being a great as Spotify it's easy to use great song selections great prices you just can't get any better than Spotify Thanks for such a great music app Spotify,1
"It will not let me listen to any music I have downloaded without wifi, very problematic sometimes it'll take my whole drive to work just to load and open a Playlist which is very frustrating,",0
Very good music easy to use,1
"After the last update, the application cannot be used. Approximately every 15 seconds, playback stops for 1-2 seconds, sometimes more. This way it is not possible to use the service at all.",0
Songs will simply not play when clicked on and the icon that shows what song you're listening to no longer appears.,0
Great content but adds are becoming annoying and app is very unstable and crashes constantly.....,0
Great sound great songs with Bluetooth hookup,1
Really nice app to listen music I hope soon this app will available to use in Gabon so that we will be able to pay from there,1
"I love spotify so much but I have 1 issue, when I'm playing songs on my Playlist it will sometimes play 3 songs and then skip to some old country music that I never added to my Playlist, other than that 5 stars!",0
You gave us more opptions to be able to have ciunless skips with ads as well GOOD JOB ðŸ‘ðŸ» Now i as well as others get to enjoy spotify the way we like to,1
"App no longer shows album tracks and I can't play the album in album order, it's always on shuffle, an app playing music so be so easy why make it so frustrating ðŸ˜ , looking for alternatives now",0
Everytime it plays an ad it skips to the end of the podcast,0
too many advertisements,0
"You've stuffed the user experience. The ""now playing"" page is difficult to find, as is the ""Play to external device"" feature, and when in landscape mode, it says nothing is playing when it is actually playing music.",0
"Enjoying every info that is enriching and to change lives, the music too.",1
"It works really good when I listen to it through my head band and through my tablet. Even when I am in an area with no wifi, it still works great. (This is me a little bit after this review) I don't know what happened, but a band called night shift productivity is no where on Spotify anymore. Even the songs I had are gone. I don't know if this is your fault Spotify, but I'm giving you a 1 star review.",1
"I've used spotify for the last few years and loved it, but the last few weeks have been clunky-songs randomly stopping and the music and plays when it says nothing is playing. It's quite annoying you cant adjust anything because nothing is ""playing"".",0
"Best app for listening song, lyrics ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚",1
Can no longer listen/preview to the song to decide if you want to add to Playlist. And approximately after two songs they drop ads. ðŸ˜•,0
"My app is currently set to offline, I can't login to my account..",0
It keeps crashing what should I do. I am using vivo v20 pro,0
"Good but whats up with internet connection? Looks like Spotify finds very hard to recognize when my cellphone its connected or not to a network, I say that cause happened several times, Spotify says im offline then i trie other apps to verify and its all normal. HELLP, more than a year already, it wasn't frequent, now it is again.",0
"Since I updated I've been waiting long minutes to finally get to search, and my internet is not the issue.",0
Overall great experience but to many ads if you don't want to pay for premium.,1
"I would give it 5 stars but I have to gave it 3 coz In spotify , advertisement are mostly of to get premium and not to hear ads . WAIT WHAT it is saying to not hear ads by giving ads (sarcastic tone) wow what a job Spotify ðŸ‘ , BTW good app but Don't give ads to not to hear ads pls ðŸ˜” Please !",0
Ii enjoy your choice of music that I can enjoy,1
Add,1
its just wonderful i love it,1
Love the app. Minus one star because what's with the new button layout?? The pause button is on the left of the screen -.- I like how it was before,0
It's gotten to the point where it's not even enjoyable using the free version of Spotify. Try to get free 30 minutes? Watch atleast a good minutes worth of ads just to not get 30 minutes of free music. Then the first song playing isn't even in the Playlist.,0
Since my podcast is on here I am learning a great deal how to us the platform even for my favorite music.,1
"I use it daily and my daughter has has figured out she can listen to Disney music on it with the tv, Moana for hours.. Also, my dad was blown away when I told him you can listen to documentaries and podcasts. I love Spotify!",0
Worst app and worst developers. Waste of time. Lagging like anything,0
"It's easy to navigate, they have a lot of different choices n genre. Ur able to create it own playlist. And it saves all the songs tht u 'â™¥ï¸', and u can choose to play it like a playlist tht u DNT even have to save. I would recommend it to a friend..!",1
Thank,1
Please add a marking option for both songs and albums ,1
"The minimized play control keeps disappearing in the new update, when closing Spotify, leaving to a different app and coming back. Pretty dumb having to restart Spotify whenever this happens.",0
Love spotify but as of the last 3 weeks it's been very glitchy and has been crashing alot no updates have been made yet can't wait to have it fixed,0
Amazing,1
And mostly works as it should now From time to time it gets artists mixed up and songs I had previously saved in my playlist automatically change It still has the same name but the actual song itself is different For example one song I had saved changed to a remix version even though it was listed as the original and had been the original for three years up until that point,1
"I enjoy Spotify ,I can make a Playlist and listen to it whenever and not have to worry about songs be added to it . It's a great and easy app ! Thanks Spotify",1
Cannot fault the app,1
"It was initially good (and still is), but now on free they're playing ads for every 3 or so songs, and they've removed the three dots that show up next to songs when searching. Since how I listen to music involves adding songs from search to queues or playlists I am forced to switch to a different service. Is otherwise very good. Decent quality, good UI. Large repository of songs. Extremely good recommendations based on listening history. Has a local files section and some very useful settings.",1
"App lately hasn't been working. Randomly stops playing and the now playing section shows nothing. I was hoping the last update would fix it but it didn't last. I use this app all day, every day. Please fix it!",0
ti's to many ads huh..... ðŸ˜¥,0
It's not much good If wanna sing Korean songs the lyrics is in both Korean and English,0
It sometimes add songs In queue that you don't want to listen (or hate) but although I have very good experience since I'm using this totally recommended....And its premium features are also awsm...ðŸ¤˜ðŸ»â˜ºï¸,1
Its alright ,1
I really enjoy the company of spotify . Thank you so much,1
Mind blowing heart touching app I am very fond of this,1
I love the many varieties of music and no commercials! I recommend this app to everyone!,1
Best streaming music platform always has been always will be,1
Never had a better music app. Mp3 skull was cool about ten years ago but Spotify takes the cake in terms of being in charge of your music.,1
"Since the latest update, it becomes so buggy and constantly crashing, it's useless to use.",0
After a while I am discovering new good music upon my musical taste. I don't really like the way you've shuffled the play buttons.,0
"this app is getting more and more annoying, I can't even open the thing, it's just getting stuck on the damn loading screen, I waited for hours last night seeing if it would load, but nope. Fix your damn app",0
I love the new music I get to listen to based on my choices. The seamless transition between my phone and laptop is a bonus.,1
"BEAUTIFUL IN ALL CAPS!!!! Honestly the best music straight platform it's really cool and the premium is even better , super satisfied with my experience in Spotify",1
"Ever since the latest update it's been slow. Not only that, but it's always shutting down while I have other apps on, like a game for instance. It never used to do that before.",0
Always good thanks,1
The app continues to freeze and then stop working even after an update. Please limit the amount of ads they get annoying and time consuming.,0
"Great app with amazing recommendations, but I wish there was an option to play the song you clicked on without it being a premium feature specific to only mobile users",0
Great selection of music!,1
"Umm It's so awesome It will gonna the topest music app I Heartly want it. It's very useful comparely with other music app But it's have a little problem, we cannot download any song from it. I hope the app management communities refix it. Thanks you all",1
"Premium user, have been having issues recently with being able to see what song is playing on the app. Can not play or pause from the app. Watch is connected to my phone and can only play/pause via the watch. So frustrating!",0
Keeps crashing mid song. The player also doesn't show the current song or if it's playing anything a lot of the time. Practically unusable.,0
Jamba juice,1
Why pay for premium if there's still going to be ads every 7 minutes? Is there something more I have to do to turn the ads off??,0
Its pretty good I have the student plan and it's not bad it's like premium it has outstanding performance but it lags about but I think it's my phone not 100 percent sure but yea,0
Totally good no hangs or g glitches alot of options too,0
Everything ia good with spotify,1
Why are my playlists full of songs that are completely different than the ones I added? This app never works properly and it drives me nuts.,0
"I've been a premium member for a number of years. Its always worked flawlessly, however after the latest update on android I cannot even finish a single podcast without it pausing, freezing, or crashing. Ive tried un and reinstalling, clearing the cache, deleting my downloads, logging in amd out and restarting my phone, seriously thinking about canceling my subscription.",0
Very good app probably best app to listen music podcast It supports underrated people which have talent and other app don't do that The only irritating thing is that advertisement but it's ok,1
Vast range of options and chandre. Love it,1
It's been great! Literally every song is in here. Highly recommend it for everyone who enjoys listening to music as sloften as I do.,1
I love the content....but this app continually crashes. The podcast keeps playing but there is no way to stop it without closing the app completely. Been this way for months.,0
"i have to pay in order to skip, loop songs and not have ads? thatâ€™s the whole point of me using a music app. if i need to pay in order to use these features, iâ€™d rather just not use this app. the unskippable ads are just annoying.",0
"Updated 04/14/2022: The app is overall good but recent updates over the past year have made it less stable on my galaxy S7, and man their podcast UI is pretty mediocre compared to castbox Original post: [5 stars] It's good",0
Very easy and all the great songs available.,1
Excellent app but please get rid of the ads.,0
"This pop-up ""Get the best Spotify experience on Android 12"" is too annoying. Please let's get rid of this.",0
Adverts are a real nuisance:-(,0
"Keeps moving songs from the SD card to device storage. Moving doesn't work, so I have to delete, reboot, force close app, and jump through all kinds of hoops just to get it storing on the card again.",0
Love this app! Being able to make my playlists and listen uninterrupted by commercials is awesome.,1
I haven't discovered my devuce's ability to play offline yet,0
Used spotify for music and podcast streaming exclusively since 2013. Wouldn't pay for any other service.,0
"Generally good, but navigation could be much easier, and the landing screen is often cluttered with things I'm not familiar with it interested in. Also, had many issues connecting with Wi-Fi... Certain things play while others do not. Would be great if the family plan was easier to use as well, so we can assign players (eg. Alexa) to individual speakers.",0
"The control you have over your music is crazy, and for the low low price of free 99",0
After the update It's even slower...,0
Organized well thought out music service,1
Best,1
New update broke the app. Randomly pauses and plays whatever I'm listening to. Every troubleshooting method failed. Fix or be canceled.,0
I had a genre on my playlist that I really liked and wanted to go and listen to that genre in my liked playlist and found that the genre has disappeared. Even though I know I have that genre of music in my liked songs playlist. It's disappointing and discouraging that I can't find all my songs in that genre anymore. I might delete the app because of it.,0
Ever time I played a song it would ether play a song that won't stop playing unless I restart my phone or it would pause at random times!,1
"Awesome experience with Spotify, try it it's really amazing ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜„",1
Best app. Great sound,1
GIVE US BACK THE OLD SPOTIFY THE NEW UPDATE IS FKN DISGUSTING THERES ALWAYS AN AD AND ITS ANNOYING.,0
"New UI with the play button in the left most just feels weird, please fix it to the standard button layout.",0
"Dear Spotify! I understand that from time to time, you need to refresh the looks of this app. But since I am alive - 30 years - I used some sort of machine or program to play music. Every! Single! One of them! Has a the following order for the playback control buttons: previous track - play/pause - next track. Why on earth you think that giving me a huge playbutton, on the LEFT and putting the prev./next button next to each other and in the MIDDLE would improve my UX?!?!?!",0
"I can't save music in my library most of the times, I lost so many albums, artists and tracks because I clicked on save but they never appeared in my library. Very sad.",0
Simply the best music app out there,1
Good ðŸ‘ morning everything looks great on music ðŸŽ¶ I think it would be great ðŸ‘,1
It's Spotify... it's great... that is all,1
Can you update,1
Music won't play through the mobile app. Nothing loads. It doesn't matter if I'm on wifi or mobile data. Please fix!,0
Suggestion: Add feature that at start volume must start from 0 to set. Create AI effect and safe for ear when volume is set at highest.,0
I wish I didn't need to retype an artist everytime I add a song to a playlist. It gets annoying when youre not quite sure which version of the song you want or you want multiple songs from the same artist,0
I use it all the time so amazing you should happier but its by edsheern and happierdivided,1
The best app with music & radio !!! Congrats !!!,1
Wonderful to listen to music on the only flaw is the annoying ads and having to pay to get them off but I love spotify so much and recommend <3,1
I pay far too much money for this app to randomly turn my music off in the middle of everything I do. every song. every shuffle. every damn day,0
the app is great but only problem is that it take to much space as you use the app in continue use it last i have seen it took my 1GB space such 100mb app extend to much.,0
"This app is so broken, idk how they manage to make it worse every update",0
"Recently had a few problems with Spotify in my old Samsung A3. Have since removed and re-loaded Spotify keep away from enhance and shuffle, pay for Spotify so only use down loaded play lists while on the move, and anything else only when I have a really good data connection. Applying enhance ment it wouldn't play at all once data connection wasn't great.",0
Inspite of the fact I lost a playlist with over 1000 songs Spotify is a great app,1
This is very helpful when it comes to finding and listening to a good musicðŸ¥°,1
"Wow! I TRULY ENJOY SPOTIFY, for SURE. I like it alot. When you pay for a premium subscriptions, you get to skip around and play what ever artist you are in the mood for. Play what you like, when you like. The mistro of my Spotify, music can mix it up and stream what ever the the misto in control feels like. He or she, can mix it up for everyone's liking! GO ahead, Down load SPOTIFY YOU WONT REGRET IT. THE BEST STREAMING MUSIC APP TO DATE! (in my opinion) and get to streaming your favorite MUSIC!",1
It is my favorite way to listen to music. Although it can be annoying if you don't have premium. But it's still amazing regardless,1
"Good app but please pay musicians more. Edit: As of the April 2022 update, it has become a mess. The ""floating"" bottom bar that has been added barely ever works or even appears, meaning that music can't be paused or skipped or anything once music starts playing. Also the home screen widget is completely broken. Please fix this Spotify. Also still pay musicians more.",0
"I love Spotify...Every Artist I have ever looked for has been on this app, gives recommendations for similar music. I have been introduced to Artists I have not heard of and in turn expanded my musical taste.",1
"Barely works, constantly says I'm offline when im next to the router. Wont play podcasts or songs and just sits there i silenced. I wouldn't mind as much apart from the fact im paying for this!",0
This is my go to when I'm looking to find new music similar to artists I â¤ï¸,1
"The computer app is awesome, but the phone app feels oversimplified. It's missing information such as track length, number of songs in a playlist, number of streams on a song, and when a song was added to a playlist.",0
just has everything I could ever want in music including the words to songs if I want them I love my Paul Simon so much and can hear everything he ever wrote inone long stream,1
"Can't pick songs, too many adds all the time, search finds the song fine but don't let you play it first before all the other stuff Spotify plays or suggests, adds adds adds Uggh.",0
"Amazing quality, with all my favourite music.",1
Good but i cant hear the songs of gravero and i dont know why Pls fix this issue!!ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,0
"I love it. I like that I'm able to pause, rewind and fast-forward my favorite podcasts",1
"would never recommend free spotify to anyone, but if you can afford premium this is the best app for music ever.",1
"Disclaimer, I have a paid subscription. great app.",1
Nice but you need better changes in spotify,0
"The music is good and reliable, I can at least rely on spotify. Thank you DJ Ken",1
This is the go to for the best servise and selection of. The latest and classic music..if you love music. Your Home..its as easy as sunday morning ..just tap and tunes thats it pick and play..videos as clear as a lovers eyes and we all know how we enjoy videos..price is priceless for what you love..,1
"Even though my account is PREMIUM, I have to turn on my data/wifi every now and then because my downloads are disappearing or unable to play when my phone is not online. What is the use of PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and having the OFFLINE MODE ""ON"" if I still need to go online every time I'll be using the app?? This has been going for months now. Same scenario with my cousin who is also on PREMIUM. If this continues, I will deactivate my subscription and uninstall the app. This is frustrating!",0
I love the oldies I can get all of them on Spotify,1
Amazing app I love this app so much.. I love how it has no ads and I love it Keep up the good work spotify!!!,1
App never shows my most recently played music properly. It doesn't link with my Facebook right either and support says there's nothing they can do. And the app is just glitchy. Spotify doesn't pay artists enough money.,0
Can't view friends activity since update. Have the settings correct for me and my friends still to no avail,0
So so like the diversity of genres available to me. I like the ease of creating my Playlist.,1
"Cannot dismiss notification before/after the alarm plays. Also would like to resume previous songs/playlist i had queued however after alarm plays, it will clear queue or play the playlist I've chosen for the alarm. (Note20 Ultra sm-n986u1)",0
"Ads with premium account, intrusive banners over lapping podcasts with video. Currently a waste of money, please improve interface and give premium users the main benefit they pay for.",0
If you want to enjoying the music so this app is best for you you can see all music of world in this app i like this app Thank you Spotify,1
Absolutely love Spotify great quality and extensive play lists,1
Better interface than any other music app. User friendly and customization is really easy too. The sound quality is impressive. Membership definitely worth the price.,1
Go,1
"Used to be good, getting worse. Buttons disappeared. Not happy",0
Currently the play bar is disappearing from the bottom of the app constantly. Extremely frustrating and yet marked as resolved according to their website. Will be leaving 1 star review until this is fixed properly because it's a core feature that should never be broken (for an extended period of time at that) in a music app.,0
"My app always has a couple of bugs that don't get solved by any update up to now (in the last ~18 months). For instance, the music that is playing, is not displayed in the app, sometimes, another music is displayed.",0
app has gone to s***. been a premium member for 5 years. I've had to download all my songs time and time again only after it's told me that it's a premium feature. what am I paying money for? songs stop playing midway but when I unlock my phone/app it continues playing.. annoying the s*** out of me. I'm hoping this gets fixed.,0
Majidsinger,1
"Thank you for keeping Joe Rogan! His podcast is the ONLY reason I have Spotify as I use Amazon music for my tunes. If you were to censor or remove Joe Rogan I would have to change this to a 1 star and delete the app. So far you guys seem to be upholding free speech so you get 5 stars from me. Also, on the app itself, so far so good, no problems, nice interface, all in all works very well. Thanks ðŸ˜€",1
"Honestly I didn't start truly enjoying Spotify until I started using the Student plan for Premium, but it's worth it. Easy listening, easy playlist organization, good quality music.",1
"Sick of spotify blaming their awful service on customers with ""high expectations."" OH, you are sorry the service didn't work as I EXPECTED IT TO????? I guess it was too much to assume that your garbage app would do anything it said it would, just like you corporate clowns. My bad. Keeps getting worse and worse. Right on the cusp of canceling. I'd rather have no music than deal with this headache.",0
Currently playing bar at the bottom disappears of you leave the app for a few minutes,0
Very interesting natural music,1
Bro ðŸ’€ i tried downloading the app today and try it out but it can't even open Lmao ðŸ’€ plus i used to use Spotify and it would keep playing random songs and when i search up something there's always different results,0
Ok,1
"App keeps cutting off, won't show playback information. Was fine until a few weeks ago.",0
Whenever I open the app and numerous times while using it I get a message that I should turn on Bluetooth. I know Bluetooth is off. I turned it off. There are no Bluetooth devices where I am. It has become so annoying that I am looking for an alternative,0
"It's a very good app , in recent time I've used Gaana and hungama but after using Spotify ,I left them and used it as Spotify have all songs and no lags but only point is that there should be some free downloads.",0
Nice app,1
"One star review because I can't play my favorite music without having some difficulties like let's say I would love to play ""build our machine"" by dagames but when I do, it just brings me to a useless album that doesn't even play the music I want to listen to and when I add music to my favorites playlist, it doesnt even play the whole song only a short 5 second clip of that song but when I play other music, it works like what and the shuffling oh my god who the hell cares about it? Just fix it.",0
I love this app and that I can get my favorite Christian music.,1
"I used to love this app, but I've began to realise when playing a playlist of mine - which is around 8 hours long - it only seems to shuffle between 15-20 of the tracks, which is very disappointing for Spotify, which I thought was meant to be one of the best apps for music.",0
Good,1
There is no different between paid and unpaid...!,0
Everything's fine except ads.,1
"If this app installs itself again it's done it 3 times, I'm through with premium Spotify, it's no damn excuse for it to completely uninstall itself, and it happens more than y'all admit. DAMN",0
App crashes when I try to watch my year wrapped.,0
"Keeps crashing after the last update, please do something about it.",1
Well the app is amazing tbh great playlists i use it all the time but sometimes it has this weird bug where i cant see the song im playing or skip thru it (even tho i have premium) which gets suuuper frustrating especially caus im paying for it,0
"It is not showing lyrics in my phone ,,,. Now its good ðŸ‘",0
I love it,1
My choice of app for music and commentary,0
"Awesome selection of songs and podcasts, I like the UI but it's by far the buggiest app I own. Been worse lately as well",0
I could not love this app more! I use it everyday.,0
"It's great to have an app for music, but the ads have become ridiculous! I'm getting four ads after one or two songs now and I can't afford the subscription currently... I really wanna know what happened to the 30 min ad free ""sessions"" that used to happen cause those were great for road trips.",0
Fix your app. You have heaps of programmers who should be able to fix the issues a lot of people are having. Just because everyone uses it doesn't mean you should be slack,0
"i love use spotify. It let me use music, prodcast and etc",0
Like how fast I can fine my music type and it's up ðŸ‘ðŸ¤™,1
"Using it and everything is SO annoying when I've finished a play list i made it played suggested songs instead of stopping or restarting, also I can't chose a song to play in my liked songs, it just makes me shuffle them, Extremely annoying",0
"Spotify not as good as used to be. Must cancel the Subscription because of untolerate bug, such as search bug, lost old playlist, and music ads too random.",0
"Not flawless, every update brings annoying bugs. For some goddamn reason they want to change the ui.",0
I like IT and the bass is so powerful,1
It's definitely the best music app..I love it but I wish there was a way one could arrange their songs in a playlist,0
Customer service is appalling. I am getting charged for two accounts and have tried to enquire multiple times without success,0
Last update killed it. So buggy and crashes almost every time. Please fix the issues,0
the adds are annoying but other then that good,1
It adds musics that i dont want to listen,1
"I want to love this, I do, and on my phone it works great, on my laptop it keeps logging me out",1
"I'm paying for premium but I'm getting 30 second ads on podcasts. They're unskippable. Also multiple instances of spotify run on my now playing list in the notification bar. App often pauses while playing through downloads and wifi, the now playing bar no longer shows up.",0
"My music keep glitches while listening to music. Sometimes it stops for full 15 mins or more. Why is it happening? I like Spotify when I stared couple years ago, now it gets annoying keeps stopping.",0
Great variety and an overall great platform! Don't give in to the dictatorial types.,1
Provide a option for detecting songs,1
Easy to use able to find the music I enjoy,1
"Keeps asking for connection to the internet, even though I have all music locally and have paid account to listen to music when far from city, where internet is not available. This last update got things worse, background playback now fails when screen is off and locked. Regret on this update is here to stay :/",0
Its annoying to use without premium like atleast let us play songs on what we pick because when we do that a whole other playlist of completly uneeded songs come and half of the time they dont even have the song i want but still its better on laptop so,0
"Really good music no breakage, but no bob marley",0
Awesome leading into Epic. Music dreams satisfied and expanded. I â¤ï¸ Spotify without a doubt. X,1
"I love Spotify cauz it has all the songs and custom tracks but the reason why I am giving it 2 stars is since there are way to many ads and I usually don't use Spotify but when I do the ads are like in different voices and the way they tell to buy premium subscription, makes me feel humiliate, because the ads are like telling me that you don't have money and all of your friends are enjoying but you are not buying the subscription..... Spotify you should really fix your ads in appropriate manner",0
So now I can't put songs on loop or they make it incredibly hard to do so AND I can't even listen to the songs on my playlist. I DONT WANT TO LISTEN TO YOU RECOMMENDED SONGS. I CANT EVEN PLAY THE SONGS I WANT TO LISTEN TO SINCE YOU KEEP ON PLAYING OTHER SONGS.,0
Great music selection,1
"This music service itself is great, but the app is so poorly implemented. Every other update, something breaks and I have to downgrade it. (potential security risk).",0
It continues to play a song that's not on one of my playlists when I try to play it,0
"App crashes randomly while I'm listening, sometimes it's 30 seconds sometimes it's 30 minutes in but still crashes. Even after updating",0
"Hate this app so much now. Spotify became so money hungry and so many ads, CANT listen to one song without hearing 4 ads in a row like I'm not even kidding. I got 5 ads in a row",0
"This is a great music app. I've found it easy enough to use and their music selection is ,different gendres artists and selection o songs is great. Need a good laugh? Try listening to Sinbad. They have a great selection of his stand up comedy .Thanks Spotify for a great listening experience.",1
Good app every song is not available though,0
Adds,1
"This app has been #1 ever since I started using it, idk why pandora is even a thing",0
DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP It have almost every songs you want to listen but even though I KEEP MY INTERNET CONNECTION ON THIS APP SHOWS THAT YOU ARE OFFLINE I JUST CANT SEARCH ANYTHING I COULD ONLY LISTEN SONGS FROM MY PLAYLIST ITS VERY FRUSTRATING  AND ALSO I HAVE REALLY GOOD HIGH SPEED INTERNET STILL ITS HAPPENING,1
"Once you find a song you like, you can click the three dots (related actions button) and start a ""Radio"" that will play similar songs. Best feature in my opinion. I give it 5 mics.",0
Well was a very very nice app but after different updates its not Well first of all I cant listen to specific parts of songs also if I wana repeat that song still I cant Also the premium version of it is going high priced It was used to be my favourite app but now its now PLEASE ITS MY HUMBLE REQUEST TO CHANGE ONLY THIS FEATURE otherwise its a great app I hope it will be changed soon,1
"I am a long time Spotify user and I have a similar issues to the other users. When I listen to music and lock my phone the bar at the bottom that allows me to pause and skip songs disappears when I unlock it again. Also, I am no longer able to scroll through categories in my liked songs. For example, I see categories listed such as rap and rock. Usually I have many options to scroll through but I'm unable to do so now and can't sort through my songs the way I want.",0
Get better at bugs but your alright for the meantime,1
Excellent this app for music is so good I love spotify,1
So many freaking ads ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ,0
This app has become really really bad. Keeps saying I have no internet connections which I do. Sound does not sound good on certain albums. Takes ages and ages to open an album or track and when playing an app it just stops playing altogether This needs to be fixed ASAP!!!!!!!! Definitely not happy at all ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”. Not good enough seeing how I am paying for this app.,0
Always my go to and always reliable,1
I can't believe I pay Â£10 a month for this and you still block the whole screen on startup with ads asking to refer a friend.,0
I really like songs and spotify also,1
"Deep&plural, im committed to my audio pleasures spotify delivers. Chockles....keep it locked..n..",1
Very good but only one problem the ads ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¥´,0
Nice one for music listeners,1
"My menu and search section cannot be used because of some errors, for example ""something went wrong"". And i can't do anything. Spotify, please fix this!",0
Amazing,1
"Very good choice of songs and podcasts, but crashing a lot, cutting , disconnecting from earbuds, disconnecting all the time from the car, the user experience is painful",0
Always crashes. Worst app ever. Only have it because of Rogan,0
"Don't play ads so frequently, unlike other apps it plays ads after 2 songs while others don't even play ads even after hearing 10 songs",0
Fix your Spotify site!,0
I love this app i Liste. To my fav songs anytime,1
Limitations on how many times you can skip is not cool Now how you space out your commercials is perfect . Please don't become like YouTube,1
Long time premium user. Just wondering if developers could implement a scrubbing bar to be present when selecting music from a playlist where the playing songs information displays down the bottom with the play/pause button. Rather than having to click into the song to scrub and then back to the playlist view to select another.,0
"Its nice listening to your favourite music playlist, spotify does all the work by searching through thousands upon thousand of songs that are similar or related to music you listened to! There's no rush, create, edit, organize and remove songs according to your preferances.",1
"The Spotify player/overlay keeps disappearing while playing songs, can't skip or see what's on while listening through headphones ðŸ˜¥",0
Very very useful Playlist Recommendations are awesome,1
"Gosh! Completely recommend.. best app to listen music ever! But only irritating thing is ads. It says 30 min uninterrupted listening after small ad, but for every 2 songs in a playlist, it displays an ad. Frustrating. But 30 min feature is very good, only if you follow it correctly.",1
It is getting on my last nerve that the music keeps stopping if my phone is not turned on and the app open. ðŸ˜’,0
Atleast have an option to remove shuffle play because it's so annoying like when I play the songs I want they a random song just pops out and I can't removei it,0
I give this app a 5 star. Even though I don't have premium I'm still enjoying it. Barely takes away percent. So many songs too pick from. I only had this app for 1 month and I love it.,1
Great variety and video option is awesome. I love that I can watch my favorite podcast in video format now. Well worth it.,1
"I hear my friends talking about spotify , how good it is this app to listen any kind of music , I'm a Salsa music fan and you didn't hear this music in the radio station anymore .so I download this app and I'm so happy to play anytime the Salsa music that I love to hear !!!",1
Nice but please reduce some adds,1
Spotify is really a boon for music lovers Have enjoyed listening to my liked list on repeat mode. But it is really disturbing to have 2 to 3 ads after 1 or 2 songs everytime. It will be good if the frequency of ads is reduced and there is more of music,0
8/10 I don't mind ads but certain ads are annoying,0
It won't play anything off my play list ot plays what Spotify wants.,0
Y'all suck now I have premium and yet y'all glitch lag and everything my favorites playlist doesn't load,0
Absolutely garbage. The updates made it crash all the time. Unusable,0
VERRY CALMING,1
Please please please please please just fix it once then stop updating it !!!,0
I don't know how I every used this app. Haven't used it in years tried to use it for one song this morning and remembered why I stopped using it. ill be back to never using it again.,0
Good list of music all round.,1
"It is the only app that consistently cannot handle Bluetooth earbuds on my current and previous phones. It skips, pauses, loses one earbud, lags, even with downloaded albums. Unenjoyable. Rarely it does it when connected to the car via Bluetooth.",0
Its very hard to listen to the songs you like since spotifY KEEP ADDING MUSIC YOU DONT LIKE INTO YOUR PLAYLISTS AND EVEN PLAYING 1 SONG CAN AUTOMATICALLY ADD ANOTHER SONG FOR NO REASON,0
Awesome and easy to use. You have all here.,1
I want the old Spotify back none of this recommended radio bs when the playlist gets to the end I just want it to start from the beginning again it's just annoying I want songs that I have put on there not ones the app thinks ill like cus I don't like them I LIKE WHAT I PUT ON THERE THATS THE WHOLE POINT OF MAKING A PLAYLIST OTHERWISE I WOULD JUST PUT ON A MIX OF MY TASTE SORT IT OUT IM PAYING FOR THIS SHI MF,0
"Playlists don't load even if playlist is downloaded, also takes noticably longer to load app since update.",0
"Does not play liked music, and after you get the 30 min of ad free music it hits you with 30 min of ads. Legit a broken app",0
Yeah good quality music. Would be good if my discover weekly actually pertained to similar genre's/artists that I listen to or follow,1
"So buggy after update, randomly pausing songs, search will only search offline songs despite being connected to internet, play bar at the bottom disappears, player doesn't appear in notification panel or on lock screen.",0
why is it always forced closed after I played songs?? it's force closed and reset my playlist.,0
Deleting this app because apparently the distribution of anti-science propaganda for money is more important to Spotify than music... Bye!,0
I enjoyed this app the first week I listened the songs on it,1
App sucks. It pauses when my phone screen goes off. Phone screen needs to stay on in order to keep music playing. Even the downloaded music and in offline mode. And even though I've allowed Spotify to run in the background. What is up with this ???????????????? So annoying and frustrating !!!!! ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ™„,0
Why are u thinking to download it or not ... just download it ...It is an app for music lovers ...,1
thsi app is good but to make it more populer u can do an updated for no paying monthly or yearly for free and can get premium,0
Too many adds and you are very restricted in what you can listen to consecutively on freeplay.,0
"It is a very beautiful and useful application. I want to download songs, how can it be done.",1
Spotify is an excellent source for great music! Check it out! You'll enjoy the latest songs and music!,1
I love this app it stays drawn over other apps in settings so I can take care of other thing on my phone without interrupting my zone...an to be honest I can't remember any addsðŸ¤”ðŸ’ªðŸ½,1
"The app wasn't playing the song I clicked on in the playlist. Tried multiple times, it was just playing completely other songs that weren't even on the playlist.",0
"I've been a long time user of Spotify but, I've been trying to put new songs to a new playlist but I can't even hear how they sound I wish they could fix this pretty soon.",0
I'm trying to make a playlist that's just a few songs and Spotify instantly adds like 15 other songs I don't know and don't want.,0
"It keeps crashing a lot this past few months. Probably the update, but needs to be fix.",0
"Mobile version needs a way to select multiple songs by now. Why can't I press and hold to have some kind of multiple files feature? I pay premium. Also, there's no way of requesting an album/artist that I've seen and when you search for the song you want you only find other people's local Playlist that you can't play. Why does it show songs you can't play? Just very frustrating, not like an app that's been out for years taking my money without any improvements.",0
"Suddenly have a new banner at the top of the app that says ""Your preview is currently active"" & the only Google result I can find has been removed by Spotify! Doesn't seem half dodgy... ðŸ¤” Care to explain what it's all about? Don't trust things I don't know about that suddenly appear, especially when the only thing I can find about it has been deleted by you. I've ceased using your app immediately and am now using YouTube until you can explain what's up.",0
A great App! I only want you to allow us download music and I will give you five stars.,1
Love this app! I have the free version and it works great. I would upgrade but feel that it's a tad too expensive.,0
"I do like this app and I listen my favorite songs of every bands I listen. The problem that I encounter is the shuffle whenever listening to a song it's always change to other music or songs. Pls do something about this but I will still give 5 stars for this app. But, pls fix those issues and problems of Spotify.",0
"I love this app. It gives great music and I love that you can see some playlist others design. And the fact that you can find more music like the music you like. Also, I can exit the app while listening and that's what makes me appeciate this app. Also the ads are a good amount reasonable and also there are plans without ads.ðŸ˜…âœŒï¸ðŸ¾",1
Love all the music. Plays very good. No stopping to buffering. nice. ðŸ˜ðŸ¥³ðŸ’ž,1
"New releases do not show up under each category of music every week. Been this way for months, no updates have fixed it. Music from 6 months ago is still listed as new releases",0
"My drop down menu is completely frozen at the top, app crashes on a daily, can't fix, literally had to uninstall and install back, download all my songs back(he!! of a lot) and problem still wasn't fixed. I am using the latest version of Spotify as well as the latest version of Android. Spotify used to be great but as of recent it seems they can't keep up with android updates as there are bugs all over the app. Seriously considering leaving premium.",0
If you want to listen a song you must listen 1 minut add first.. After than you can listen a 3 mint song. You can't skip add...... Worst application too much advertisements,0
No problems whatsoever!!! Love it... Thank you,1
"Used to love this app but recently I haven't been able to use it properly. It constantly stops when I open it, I can't skip songs, I can't download songs and there are too many bugs since the latest update.",0
I just want to play my music or skip my music or even see what song is playing. The app has been completely broken for me and everyone I know for the last week.,0
I download podcasts before I go to work. While listening to the aforementioned podcasts when I roam out of range of WiFi the app will decide to stop playing the episode. The app also does similarly when I'm trying to start an episode that I've already downloaded while being offline. Why does your app have to ask central command to show me things I've already downloaded?,0
The app logged me out for no reason then deleted all of my downloads after sending me a forgot password link that never worked and when I did get in it logged me out immediately when I went out of the app. I had Wi-Fi the whole time as well,0
"Spotify is currently useless, I can't pay for premium anymore. Its like they don't want my money anymore",0
Listen carefully songs ðŸ˜Š happyness life hey there nice app spotify music ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶,1
Truly marvelous. Loads better than YouTube Music. Here you can avail all the features of YouTube Premium for free. Even the ads are no bother. I would've rated it a 10/5 star app if I could.,1
"Lately it's been a poorly functioning mess. Play controls don't show up. Stops playing randomly. Restarting doesn't fix it, and it seems like flipping a coin if Spotify if going to work properly or not. Very frustrating.",0
Lately the bar to skip/pause hasn't been coming up and the music shuts off when I leave the app,0
good quick source of music,1
Spotify is very very very because there is so many songs all about like Oriya hip hop songs Hindi songs Marathi songs Gujarati songs all be conducted in that app and you also hot in train in bus and any other place so I think so sporify is best for me also and and Spotify is best for you also,1
No ads. Choose your own music. Better than Pandora and Apple Music. Download it now. That's an order!,0
I'm sorry but who thought it was a good idea to remove the option to hear a part of the song when you are adding songs to your playlist???? I love Spotify don't get me wrong but that little detail had make the process of making a playlist less enjoyable... Please bring that back.,0
Lots of ad show inside the app,0
I have never left a review because this app was perfect. Now it stops randomly several times while playing a song. And it doesn't show what song is playing. Fix this or I'm ending my subscription,0
"After the last update it stops playing randomly, currently playing notification disappears on its own while the app keeps playing, and it has to be restarted. It wasn't that great from the start, but at least there were no bugs, and with the last update you've made it much, much worse.",0
"The app features are not stable, the music player sometimes appears in the app and times it doesn't, the car music player no longer works... I'm beyond frustrated with the app!",0
"even tho the app is great be careful at the moment of the payment if you don't have an automatic payment since it will try to give you a more expensive plan every time w/o you realizing, and also there's is some kind of bug that don't let the phone and the PC to sinc properly and also in the phone it sometimes stops showing you or allowing you to see the song you are playing",0
It's so annoying I wanna play my playlist in order not shuffle I also made a playlists with only two songs and I clicked the play button and played a song that's not even in the playlist and it's so frustrating,0
In the beginning Spotify was good but now it is the worst I can't skip music when I search for a song it gives me a playlist wih the same name and it doesn't even contain the song I want and songs are not full when I play a song it gives a very very short part of it uh And honestly sound cloud â˜ï¸ is better ðŸ˜Œ,0
Music doesnt stop when I receive a phone call,1
"Spotify allows the spread of misinformation. They pay podcasters that are notorious for disseminating inaccurate and outright false news. In addition, premium subscribers are subject to watching ads while streaming podcasts.",0
Fantastic and.most enjoyable and easy to get your favourites,1
Best music app that contains almost all songs,1
"My podcast episodes have been scrambling up. One finishes, and not the next one starts playing, but a completely different one. Can you explain this to me?",1
It would be nice if it wasn't literally north korea on there,0
"Good and all BUT today, i put it on 'liked songs' and it played FOUR LONG ADS just to play a 'suggested song' WTH? Also now, Im only getting one skip an hour. Please fix these",0
You had an option to listen to the part of the song before adding to playlist which has been removed. Bring it back.,0
"Latest update makes the ""current song"" and navigation disappear. No way to pause or skip track. It messes up Android auto as well. Need to force close the app for this to reappear and function correctly in Android auto. v8.7.20.1261",0
"I search song, i get song, i play song, i never get to listen the selected song, shuffle forced, system forced, hate more than i need to :-(",0
"I can believe I thought apple music was it ,this is 10000000000 times better",0
I can't even hear the music I want now I can't even skip the songs I don't want to hear this is good only fo the first day,1
"It was great before the update now its just trash not even worth 1 star, it's disappointing..",0
The bugs are mostly gone but its slow to start up. Perfect other than that,0
"Finally, I can listen every Queen song ever made.",1
My spotify is not working!ðŸ¥²,0
Constantly pauses the JRE podcast! Drives me nuts. I lock my screen and within 5 minutes every single time is pauses and I have to reopen app to play. I change this to 5 simply for the fact they're the one tech company trying not to play the role as censor.,0
I Just keep logging out when I want to play the music. It's just happened recently! Please repair this! My phone is vivo V21,0
What I despise about this godforsaken app is that it AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT WARNING put my music i was listening to on EVERY tv of the house. I also had to take 2 HOURS to fix one of the tv's that stopped working due to the sudden cause of it happening. Im editing this review a few mintues later to add 2 things 1 YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO A DIFFERENT SONG TO STOP THE SONG THAT WAS PLAYING (atleast i didnt know how to stop the song) and you can just use youtube and or another device to listen to music,0
I wish the premium free trial lasted a bit longer,0
Good app my best,1
keeps adding songs I never added. devs are retarded.,0
This app was very nice for long term,1
"What the hell, spotify, I didnt ask you to add more songs to my playlist. You also took away tge ability to play individual songs and rearrange songs in playlists",0
Easy to use and enjoyable. The music available is fantastic,1
"The podcast feature has many bugs. If I sort by date and filter by unplayed, it works, but whe I get back to the same screen later it shows all podcasts, altough the unplayed option is still ticked. Sometimes the sorting also doesn't show newer unplayed podcasts. Moreover, sometimes it only plays one podcast, sometimes it plays a older podcast next, not the next one by date.",0
"The app is good but, I think it's too restricting. For example, I played my fav song in my playlist but somehow, it played the other different song in my other playlist. Second thing is that, my cousin purchased the premium and it doesn't even show the download button or neither a pending bar for the download. It also doesn't show if the music is downloaded or not. It's a shame that the app has great performance but it's too restricting.",0
Please fix the mobile network download bug... Data ain't cheap. Still 5 Star though,0
Best music streaming app! But.. I've got premium and it keeps crashing!!!! Also please make it possible to easily block other users on mobile devices! I'll be chilling listening to my music and it will just stop and close!!!!! It's so annoying and I really like music so please please tell me how to fix it or like update it.,0
Added songs I never had correlation too and I can't even listen too songs without do a entire process,1
"Great app, music all the time with premium. Works great for me.",1
New update is horrible sais on my home tab that I have my old playlists and when I go to my library it's sais I have no playlists or songs this is disappointing as its been working for years and I pay premium,0
"Misinformation is an illusion, most information is opinion. And I enjoy hearing opinions. Kind of like music is supposed to be.",0
CUTE,1
"I truly love this app! I love the many genre of music I find, and how easily the search engine works within my library, or when I'm looking for that special song from way back when. Duo list is another awesome idea I enjoy. Two thumbs up ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘",1
Bruh every time when I select a song for my alarm it always plays ANOTHER SONG like I selected I won't run and it played we'll meet again bro spotify fix you're god damn app and make it better oh wait you can't you guys are horrible with you're job,0
Love my Spotify Premium!,1
"Having challenge with ""playing now bar"" showing up. ðŸ¤”",1
It works for the most part,1
App gets stuck on the logo screen,0
"Playback over bluetooth is crackling. It's not the bluetooth device or the phone, it's the Spotify app. Neither reinstall nor clear cache is working to solve this. For a paid service this must be fixed.",0
Too much ads,0
Spotify is just Great,1
"Flawless, love everything about it, I've converted people from Pandora and other services to Spotify love the duo account great for me and my wife ðŸ‘ðŸ‘",1
Great for both music and podcasts! Easily the subscription service that I use the most!,1
"The app goes into endless loop during right code acceptance,and says something went wrong. Whereas if the code input is incorrect,it immediately says it's wrong.",0
I dropped it a star because spotify cannot find the Internet connection on my Galaxy tab s8 ultra. Will update when I can find a fix,0
Spotify is very good aap for listening music,1
I love this app...it's the greatest...plays a variety of genres which I though wouldn't never been available..,1
"Just had to update review as it seems Joe has gone at the moment on the 21/2/22, that's the English version of dating, with him gone, so will Spotify from my phone. Deleted.",0
"My car's Pioneer player can't link to Spotify with the latest update. It seems that I'm not the only one facing this issue. Connected via Bluetooth, can stream sound with Bluetooth but the Spotify feature is not working. Have to literally downgrade my phone's app to a previous version for it to work. Please fix this asap ya. Other than that, it's an awesome app and service.",0
The update earlier this year has stopped connecting to my car stereo Spotify app. This was the main reason I went with Spotify and the stereo. The unit is a pioneer MVH-X580DAB. I have since updated the firmware and it is not that. After doing some research it appears to be a common problem with different stereos. I don't just want to roll back my Spotify app. I would like it to be fixed. Or do I go back to amazon?,0
Super op its is best for muice app and its really op i listen 2000 songs ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž,1
The best music app,1
"I don't usually writing review but Spotify really out did themselves this time the app has always had problems finding other devices to connect to and now they have removed the refresh search function, please fix this issue it's a massive hassle, honestly only use Spotify because that all PS4 support's",0
You gotta change the play/pause menu back to the center,0
oml it is an absoloutly amazing app im in love!! my playlist give off the aesthetics that i want and as im a student i find it really useful,1
Unique and surprising,1
"Same problem as everyone else using the free version, they've updated Spotify to force people to pay up or go home.",0
"WE'LL HIDE THIS FROM HOME FOR 90 DAYS, How about never put podcasts on my homepage ever. I don't want my music app to be covered in political podcasts. If my family didn't already have a plan I would rather use the free version of Pandora and if I was going to pay I'd use apple music.",0
"I always like Spotify i spend my most listening to it.Everything's good until you get ads. Like please, common after every 2 songs we get ads. It's okay if not everyone take premium atleast to get premium you should not make the free one worse please Spotify look at it and reduce ads. And moreover it's not only one ad, it almost comes like 3 in a row. Live a little time to enjoy music.",1
Great choice and variety,1
If I could leave zero stars I would. You're trampling freedom of speech by removing Rogan episodes. I won't be using Spotify any longer.,0
It's not logging in at all I reinstalled 16 times but it always shows no internet connection even after having connection pls fix this problem,0
Player keeps disappearing. Only way to fix is to restart my phone. Closing out app and reopening doesn't work.,0
5 ads before I can listen to one song,0
"Usually enjoy using the app, but tons of issues since update - can play, but can't pause, skip, etc. No bar showing to adjust. Please fix!",0
Highly recommended platform if you want to listen a music,1
Spotify is awesome!,1
Please allow premium subscription to be paid by Google Play Store balance as it is in other apps.,0
"Update: the mobile app has been very buggy lately; sporadically won't show the current song/podcast episode to pause, etc. And lately has been closing the app instead of minimizing when switching between apps. Original: Best music app out of the several I have used over the years. User-friendly interface, excellent organization capabilities, and on-point suggestions for my varied tastes. Easy to find music in English and Spanish; almost never disappointed with search results.",1
"I personally love Spotify, u have not just the run of the mill songs, they also have so many remixes, and they create your own playlist for you too!! Definitely worth the 5 stats from me!! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ’œðŸ’›ðŸ§¡ðŸ’™ðŸ’–",0
There is this glitch that says I'm playing the song and then it's playing the other song,0
Great app. Even without premium you still get options. I listen to podcasts on this app and it is great...so many options and no ads while in the middle of podcasts. Occasionally the music does not play without wifi even though its downloaded,1
It's simple to use ......kinda confusing but it's awesome...think imma so get the hang of it ....don't think I can give it five â­s cause it's kinda complicated.... maybe ðŸ¤·ðŸ¾â€â™‚ï¸it's jus me . DnSpnG!!!,1
"Hate this app. I have Spotify premium and it's a good service, but the app SUCKS. Especially for podcasts... the UI is bad, and I want to dismiss suggestions. There's podcasts that are always on my home page that I will never listen to, and I can't make them go away. Seriously poor app.",0
The April 22 update is full of bugs. Playlists or albums suddenly stop without warning. The actual player disappears sometimes and worst of all when using Bluetooth Spotify starts on its own. Uninstalling the app doesn't improve things. Poor effort from Spotify as it seems to be widespread but no update to rectify these issues has been produced.,0
"this is a great app but come on,4-6 ads at a time is too much:/",0
Something happened with lyrics service It's not working my Adroid phone.,0
"The latest update keeps freezing after about 2 or 3 songs and when I open spotify on my phone it won't show what's playing and I can't pause or skip forward or back. I shuffled my entire liked songs, over 5,000, and it plays the same 10 song loop every time I hit shuffle.",0
"Litterly such a terrible app unless you have premium, I was like wow this is an AMAZING app with the 30 day free trial, and now, I can't listen to ANY SONG I LIKE, all they do is put random ones, I have not used this app once after the premium ended, they never let me play any song in my Playlist or any song... stick to YouTube because this is horrible, 'I can't give this app a 0 so I give it a one'",0
Not high quality music,0
Thank you for reducing the adsðŸ’•,1
Its a good music app but its like disrespecting non premium users. You need to buy premium to listen every music you search.,0
App is crashing whenever I tried to play a song tried everything,0
Bad aap,1
brilliant but if you can't afford to subscribe too many adverts but that's what you get if you don't pay,1
"The app has every song imaginable but I can't even get a half hour worth of music without 8 different ads,listening to more ads than music",0
"I have to keep Uninstalling to stop the music. Connects great to blue tooth head phones and my car with ease, however once I'm done or need the music off I can't find the pause or stop button... the only option is to turn the volume down or change the song.",0
Amazing! There's whatever song you want!,1
What can I say that is already a masterpiece. Better then other applications.,0
I love Spotify so much...it is the best app I used to listen to music...guys try this app out u will not regret..ðŸ¥°âœ¨,1
Best music service I've ever had!! But gets pressured into silencing opposing opinions...,0
I enjoy finding music of all kind an especially fr the pass I like the search always helps me with what I'm looking for correctly,1
"The app crashes when I'm trying to select a song, so I can't add any songs to a playlist or to the queue",0
It's very useful and mind blowing app. I enjoy it always.,1
"Overall it's good. But why do I have to login so many times ? I don't understand why this is taking place , everytime I have to enter my phone number and enter the code and then it's letting me see my playlists. Please look into this. And what is wrong with this frequent lagging ? it's worsening day by day",0
"After hearing so much about how ""great"" this app is I decided to try it out and honestly it just blows.. I don't see what the big deal is. It's no different than any other music streaming app.",0
"Logged into my account, but couldn't listen to music nor see my playlist of the songs I liked and downloaded and I'm mad because I had 57 days left for my premium. This needs to be fixed immediately!!",0
Love listening to the radio station specially while I'm on my ice cream truck selling ice cream,1
"EXCEPTIONAL !!! If I subscribe to Spotify, will the subscription be subjected to Vat and how is the subscription collected? Can I pay for a 12 month contract or perhaps set-up a direct debit contract? Please let me know.",0
Outstanding...Variety of music for everyone!,1
It would be better if developers optimize this app for andriod Devices as i have seen there's no problem in ui and music quality in apple devices but when comes to andriod it has laggy ui as well as not so good music quality..,0
"With the new update my search box is broken, music doesn't play anymore, all my liked/downloaded music was deleted and the app is pretty much completely useless at this point. After 3 years of premium I'm switching to Tidal at least they have Dolby Atmos",0
Obvious bug fixes need to be made. These issues come and go but as of writing this - the user experience is a massive headache.,0
"Premium is everything....if you don't have then never mind...bare with 2-3 ads after 5 songs at average, but still..it's my favourite.",1
"Spotify is awsome, but it keeps crashing, so much to that i cant even use it anymore. Id just open up the app and it would crash. I hope this will be fixed soon^^",0
Was good at first then the update came up it dosent let you play the song you like,1
I love listening to the massive range if songs but I don't like the new update Because of how you can only listen to songs in shuffel mode and the reason I don't like that is because I prefer stuff to be in order and not just random songs in the playlist and it also skips 2 songs and that really annoys me,0
Okay Spotify if its free thin you guys need to stick to that no b.s with limited skips really in my opinion Spotify needs to be pulled off the app store just because of how messed up Spotify is it plays songs I have no interest in and the add wall is so bad I only use it for my xbox,0
"I used to love this app. but now you've completely ruined the experience with your updates and re-crafting. It's complete and total garbage now. If your trying to shed users, to go to a pay to play format, you've only half the formula right.",0
"The app is okay, but the company supports anti-vax podcasters, so use it and that's what you're supporting.",1
"Signed up for premium, but it didn't take. Might have been my mistake. Great sound, great library to choose songs from!",1
Third time Google has deleted my review. Spotify promotes podcasts that spread mis*information.,0
"Terrible app, glitchy, shows new episode when there are none, doesn't show when there are new episodes. Barely plays anything good when on shuffle, so many adds, everything suggested is bad. Seriously I'm going back to the app I made myself this is so annoying",0
"Loads of music and podcasts, plenty of adjustable settings, solid stability n performance.",1
"It is a great app I am very satisfied with it but if can you make an option on lyrics that you can translate them, but still it's the best app from my sight",1
Good But ads aargh!,0
It would be nice if I didn't have to reinstall it constantly because songs or podcasts just refuse to play!,0
Having trouble with the app. Everytime im playing music and the phone locks. Its stop playing the music. I have deleted the app many times and its keeps doing the same. And know i get message saying that i need to give permission to be hable to play in the background. Check that to and everything looks normal. No idea whats wrong!!!,0
"Great music app, has a good variety of genres",1
Music and podcasts. It works.,1
"I love music. This app not just plays music, podcasts etc it organises and gives a great opportunity to manage and arrange the different styles of music I like, so I can find what I'm in the mood for easily.",1
"A great experience. I've used many music streaming platforms but this is by far the best , and expecially I love the huge amount of good playlists available to keep you engaged everytime. Also the song suggestion is on point love the experience. Look the reason i gave you 4 stars is I feel like the premium membership is a bit expensive. I am a user of premium individual for 2 years now but still , many other apps like gaana are offering their premium in much cheaper rates(400/year).",1
"I enjoy using the app when I'm going to work, I also like the Google maps added feature.",1
"Settings for not work, have the setting turned off where spotify add song that are similar yet they still play getting annoyed of listening to bands o don't want to hear. I made a Playlist to listen. To what I want to hear not your suggestions.",0
If you guys can make it so I can play music from the widget and not having the app run in the background that would be awesome,0
"Great app. Easy to use, clear musics. I love, love it.",1
Simple and easy to use and access any music all the time. Family plan is perfect for each member to manage their own lists .,1
Great music and podcast even in Spanish,1
Changing my rating from 5 to 2 because ever since the update I've had nothing but issues.... forever a loading screen. Wont load on my smart watch.. says I'm listening to different song than I actually am listening to..... I'll change rating back if all this gets fixed bc I typically love spotify,0
"Spotify is goof for me but since last week, is not showing the album cover. I wish they could repair this.",0
"Reducing to 3 stars as downloading songs doesn't seem to make a difference, either slow to load or simply don't load when my connection is low or disconnected. EDIT: Reduced straight to 1 star! Since latest update I cannot play songs on Spotify u less I have the app open which is pretty useless tbh. It wasn't fixed after 2 weeks so I cancelled my subscription and now it seems that i can't listen to any music just ads, ads and more ads! Deleted!! I'll just use YouTube premium instead thanks.",0
the app is amazing to listening awsome feeling.my fav songs listening very comfortable,1
Very good it's easy to find the latest music,1
Mostly good ad spam is a little to harsh,0
Why when I click the sound I want to play it not the song I wanted this is a bad app,0
Why am i not able to search on it after my last update. spotify plz cheak n if it is a bug plz solve it as fast as you can,0
Good music choices.,1
It's an overall good experience but I'm just not going to pay money to have more than six skips an hour,0
Every alternate day there is a update. Why?,0
Wowamazing,1
"Simply the best out no need to say more. Everyone already uses therefore favorite. This one, Sprint forced me to use for free about 10 years ago and I haven't used any other since. So...",1
Not able to block other apps from disrupting music,1
I love this app... the only one I listen to is Spotify.,1
"Thought this would be better than listening to YouTube, but there are just as many commercials....if you pay for no commercials your literally the enemy of every one else who uses this app....what kind of SIMP gives these a-holes money to listen to free music?",0
"This is the stupidest app ever. I can't listen to the song I want, instead it plays a random playlist that I can't open, can't control and have no idea what's coming. I keep trying to play a specific song but nooooooo it just plays a random song. Great for anxiety, so great.",0
This app is very easy to use and the ads also were less,0
My biggest gripe is when I am listening to an album I don't want to hear gaps between each song if they are supposed to flow into each song. I might be on the older side but it does take a bit of the enjoyment away when listening to Pink Floyd and when the song should continue into the next. That pause does more harm. It's worth those extra 2 stars I am keeping from you.,0
Absolutely love spotify A must for all music lovers especially if youre genres vary all the time Do yourself a favor and get premium Make your own playlists and look up any random song you here,1
Worst app ever I be getting ads every 3-5 songs also there's over 3 ads now every time. The ads also have an annoying voice! Dont get this app.,0
It's a nice app with background play and it's easy to make playlists and all..but I'd recommend it that you add the clear history option back and make it so that you know which song is gonna play next. It's a good app overall,1
Loud Spotify premium ads after every 4 songs in the Free account are irritating. Revised rating to 1 as the ads are not only frequent but demeaning to free subscription users.,0
I've loved using Spotify with the recent update it plays through my phone as well as my Bluetooth in my car this needs to be fixed it's driving me crazy I would've given five stars if it worked like it used to,0
It keeps cutting off on me in the middle of an episode!,0
This app has had many bugs but the update made it worst I can't preview songs to add to my playlist.,0
Its the best $10 I spend a month . Amazing . However the new patch made it suck so hard. PLEASE FIX YOUR APP SPOTIFY!!!!!,0
No words it's amazing ðŸ˜„â˜ºï¸,1
Wonderful music...all my favorites that I haven't heard in years,1
It sucks. You can't listen to a certain song because Spotify is so bad at making a non money hungry app.,0
This is a best song app,1
Consume more mobile data even in data saver mode,0
"Asks me to turn on Bluetooth, every time i start/change to the app",0
is good and very easy to use,1
There is no search option for song.,0
I cant listen to my songs like its so dumb the old one was better,0
Joe Rogan!!!!!! I'm leaving YouTube. But would like the focus and encouragement for people to move over. Need better focus on videos maybe??,1
Buggy af. I just updated it and it's still giving me problems.,0
"I kinda like this app. In bad moods it give me calm feeling. One and only problem of this app is advertisements of Spotify premium,if we have luck sometime we've get 30 min of uninterrupted music that's it. But all-rounder it's a good music app I've personally recommend this to my friends",1
"Best music streaming service .I cannot believe it took me so long to use this app!!!!! Loads of songs, I used to buy them all on disc so very annoying when I can't listen to music I have bought on apps like Amazon music Not a problem with this app it's excellent",0
"So great. Subscribed now. Best thing. Listening own playlist while reading, gaming, dancing, dating. The best. Up to date podcasts, music, Sigrid, Devon Cole, etc. Couldnt ask for more. I'm in.",0
The app is great but when i play a song it shuffles and plays a different song,1
"Spotify has always been quite the reliable app, but recently it has been anything but. A recent large update seemed to create a lot of bugs that can't be ignored. Music would stop randomly when I lock my phone, when leaving the app running the player would sometimes not show up forcing me to restart the app to get it back and sometimes a different song would be playing than what it shows in the player. Not exactly the premium experiance I was promised...Hope at least these bugs get fixed soon",0
Its really good Im always using it every day Love it  ,1
Great music platform,1
"Someone hacked my account and changed my DOB and now I can't change it back. Also, there aren't random genre Playlist. Only what someone has created.",0
It's simply one of the best applications ever used and it's a must have on all of my Android devices plus also on my Microsoft Windows phone,1
Love this app you guys have all my favorite music.... price has gone up...hope they do not go up anymore,1
App stopped working after update. I can only play saved music because the main page or search doesn't appear at all.,0
Money hungry.. needs more old selections and morally a questionable company.,0
Something wrong with phone number verification method. It sends otp but after entering it doesn't allow to log in,0
"Really great! All songs are nice and clean. You can even turn of your device and it will still play! 11/10, would recommend for sure.",1
Too many ads,0
"So many bugs. Keeps on disconnecting with my tws buds. Car connection is also buggy, doesn't display song info on unit.",0
I love this app so much,1
"When I downloaded and started the app, it was showing ads continuously for 5 mins and after that I deleted it instead of waiting songs to play. I know, I was using free version, but this doesn't mean I'm suppose to watch ads only.",0
"Greatest streaming app on the entire store, huge collection of songs with HQ sound. And what's make it the best is that it works in all regions unlike Apple & YT Music.",1
"You can go screw your selfs becues there are songs playing that arent even in my playlist when i play it and i swear to god if this is another one of ""improvements"" your dead wrong becues i dont want those songs if they arent in my playlist",0
This app is really good and helpfull for mind freshness,1
Moved over from Apple Music. Loving the premium look of the app + all the features. Hoping we get Spotify Hi-Fi soon now so I don't miss Apple lossless too much,1
Super buggy. Quits unexpectedly and doesn't show a play bar. They gotta figure this out.,0
So much better than struggling to download music to listen to! Got the premium and its worth every penny!,1
The algorithm radio is bad coz it just show you the latest songs you frequently heard.,0
"I used to love this app. I use it for 8+hours a day most days. Over the last 6 months it has become worse and worse. It crashes, I loose the controls, it pauses for no reason, songs cut out. I have really started to think about switching to another service.",0
It's so easy to listen to your music and I give this a 5 star cause it's just so easy to use like this is the best I can turn off my phone and I can still hear it like this is amazing,1
You just have to pay even for music to shuffleðŸ¤¦soo materialistic,0
Great access to incredible music,1
This app was awesome until there's 2 adds you cant even skip they add songs to you play list not to mention they randomly turn on shuffle i used to use this app all the time on my old account now pandora is better or use 10 hour vids on youtube terrible job spotify its hard to think of anything good with this app that other apps dont do better spotify is the bottom of the list for music spotify i dont want to even see your adds anymore how far this app had fallen,0
"Give yours attention towards the language like non Korean can't understand exact Korean language but if it is written in "" Bo ran du shii"" so we can understand the pronounciation. Also sometimes many songs were removed from playlist and that's it I found out that the song was removed by Spotify from the app plzzz at least don't remove the song which u add in app. It's a humble request ðŸ˜Š",0
excellent application more than the others.,1
Too many adverts...,0
Could be a lot more user friendly,0
After I updated it it told me that my payment expired tried to renew it but it's not working now I'm looking for another music player pls fix it,0
I would give 2.5 stars if I could. The app is great... When it works. Some updates are great while others render the app unusable. I want to give 5 stars but the inconsistencies are brutal.,0
"This is the best app, easy to use, works across all platforms and syncs with other apps easily. Finds recommendations that are always on point, new music or playlists that work well, great algorithms!",1
Have been a Spotify premium user for quite sometime. But recently the app keeps crashing.. music suddenly stops and I'm unable to find the currently playing button on my app. Please fix it ASAP!! Else gotta try out YouTube premium,0
"Thank you Spotify love it so much,,,,,,",1
It's good at the part of songs but after a while it will just delete your Playlist and change it with recommended songs. It becomes more annoing because it won't let you change it ever again with any songs so it won't let you pic a song from any Playlist ever again after a month so it becomes useless to ever use again. And it will automatically more liked songs if you don't have enough then it shuffles like 20 different songs even though you say 1 song,0
"My original issue has changed to a new one; now there is no play, rev, ff buttons. It mostly plays without randomling turning off, but I have to close the whole app to turn it off and cannot go back or skip ahead. Sometimes it will show those buttons but tell me nothing is playing (when something is playing) so those buttons are useless.",0
I love Spotify so much # love music,1
"Overall, it is nice. But maybe you can add a new feature or option of displaying the translation of the lyrics into english.",1
"Great service, garbage app. Constantly looses connection, bottom bar disappears, and switching songs sometimes crashes it.",0
It is money every where ðŸ¤‘ not what you can control so useless app,0
No doubt a great collection of music at your feet. But why doesn't the app just keep playing? Stream on and don't stop!,1
"Premium is more than worth the ten dollars for me. I use Spotify 24/7. However, I wish there was a way to move the order of songs around in a playlist on moble. P.S. They've since changed this so as of writing this I don't have a problem. I do recommend they add a mono/sterio setting for each individual connected Bluetooth device and also a feature where you can start a playlist where you've left off after switching to another.",0
I love Spotify! If fact I am a long term premium user. I use Spotify every day from work and out of work on my phone. Well before this new update I used to be able to switch what was playing from my computer at work to my phone and now I am unable to! I am so frustrated that I am give one of my favorite services one Star. I am doing this because I am a premium user and since my account has music left playing at work I am not going to be able to use Spotify from my phone all week end! ðŸ¤¬,0
Love spotify!!! I can find pretty much any music I love!!,1
"Spotify is a pretty good app, but I dont like how it says enjoy the next 30 mins of uniterupted music 10 mins later another add, I also wish you could orginaze your playlist custom, other wise its a preety good app",1
"After a while, my account was unable to be edited and my username appeared as random letters and numbers. Whenever I tried to play a song, it would play a 30 second ad and then do the ""You'll get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" thing. But even though the ad was over, the timer was still counting up. I couldn't do anything on the app and all of my playlists had been removed, as well as my search history. ðŸ™ƒ",0
Great app to enjoy songs,1
Spotify is the best I couldn't live without their music,1
Nice clear sound very satisfied,1
The app does perfectly what it was meant to do. Enjoy music,1
I can't describe what it would be like to not have Spotify to help get through life in this disappointing world. Just the best music app out there.,1
Spectacular music streaming......I love it,1
"Last year I suggested to add a feature to enable premium periode checking by app, and they did it! Thank you for listening what customers needs.",1
"The ads are supposed to be after half an hour. But this app irritates alot with frequent ads. I have faced at least 3 times ads within half an hour duration. If this stays on, i will never recommend this app to anyone and definitely going to uninstall the app. Talking about the good side, the app is overall 4 star",0
"Please fix the bugs that have been introduced in the latest version, can't control the playback of my music, which I consider a basic feature",0
"Autoplays random song when locking screen, randomly starts a radio when i select a playlist When connecting to my car's bluetooth I can't select the currently playing song, app requires full restart. Play bar is not appearing",0
"I loved it until I found out the theifs were taking my money when I chose the free version, those fools better give me my damn money back.",0
"I have been on Spotify Premium for a while now and I have started ti notice that for some reason I get logged out of my Spotify, I put my passoword in and it says that it is offline while I can clearly get emails from Spotify and no problems, I recive the email for login without password BUT IT DOESN'T WORK, PLEASE FIX THIS, THIS HAS BEEN A HUGE PAIN FOR ME, NOT SO ""Premium"" AFTER ALLðŸ˜’",0
Add some more advertisements so we can enjoy your advertisements without playing the songs,0
It's fine. I just don't like it when it puts stuff in my playlists,1
It's really good!! I love using it to listen to music in the background of my games!! And when I just need a good playlist ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ 5 stars 100%,1
"I love this app, all the music I listen to in one place! I have premium, which is AWESOME, though sometimes it glitches and the song will play but it won't come up on the app so I can't pause it or anything but other than that it's great. If you don't have premium it kinda sucks because you can't even really choose the songs you wanna play, which annoyed me before I got premium, but it's still so good ðŸ˜ðŸ’…âœ¨ good job.",1
"Shuffle doesn't do its job very well. Plays all artists in a row. Also doesn't play all my songs, get stuck on a small rotation of the same songs. Not sure why this is but I dropped premium because of it.",0
Works really well the pre made song library's are really good I highly recommend this app for listening to music,1
Used to love this app. Now 2 songs and 3 commercials 2 songs 4 more ads. Also while playing MY Playlist they add songs they think I'd like or remake versions of my songðŸ˜¡ I can Play a radio station with less ads,0
"Using it all the times but the remote function from my Galaxy Watch is not working, which is one of the main reasons i bought it for!!!",0
I enjoy using Spotify.,1
I have premium and its just so fun to listen to music when your somewhere where there is no connection,1
"Very often the UI is not showing a song or podcast is playing, meaning it cannot be paused or skipped. Only way to get it back for a while is to force stop the app.",0
Great music for all kinds of listening and still great,1
It's easy to use. An I have found every artist I pur in,1
Spotify is so annoying i wanna play my playlist/like musics but it goes to a different song like from suggested songs,0
Very good collection and what ever we need in music we get here,1
Found some new music through recommendations from other bands that follow. Always love discovering new music.,1
Spotify is the app to have when you need assistance while driving. Good music or when you need directions on the road while driving. It just makes your driving time must easier and enjoyable. What a pleasure to have. Thank you Spotify. Get this app.,1
"I uninstalled this app because I don't have any use for it anymore and as soon as I did that, the ads for it appeared on YouTube videos Just how freaking desperate do you have to be to promote it this much Please buzz off",0
I fell in love with Spotify all my favourite songs are there. Excellent app best ever. The best App for Music.,1
Bruh...whatever you all updated ruined the app. No control over whats playing? Cmon...change it back or im out,0
"I love the app if I could rate it out of then I'd say nine though, the reason is because the ads are soo annoying but overall I like the app it has various options of music and you can find most songs that you want",1
"I love it, I can literally stream everywhere. Thank you all so much!!",1
Too much ads pop up in no time they say for 30seconds ad and listen for 30min but after every 15-20min a ad pop ups and kills vibe,0
Didn't realise when I downloaded that it's a trial experience and after a couple of weeks they pretty much make it useless to use. No thanks. Back to Amazon Music for me,0
There is no better music app....so much and more everything i want to listen to i can find it here.,1
A good application for feeling the taste of amazing music,1
"The latest update is causing the app to randomly pause on its own and cause the now playing bar with play/pause to disappear. Transitioning from phone audio to Bluetooth, Android Auto, or Chromecast frequently cause audio to stop working. A song will be playing, but you won't be able to hear it. When using Android Auto and streaming music, anytime a phone call comes in it causes the audio to not return once the phone call is done. I have to unplug my phone and plug it back in to get it to work.",0
The app keep crashing when i started to play the song. Seem like the others also meet the same problem. As a new user i was totally disappointed since i thought Spotify was good and function well to use.,0
Works but then doesn't. The play pause button disappears and I have to restart my phone just to get it to stop,0
Please can you fix thiss i cant log into my acount and it is a premium acount since last night please fix thiss,0
"This app is not compatible with Google Home devices with multiple users and accounts. Completely useless to have a family plan that never actually works to listen to different content on different devices, while logged into different accounts. Also: I cancelled my account last month, and still was charged again. I guess I have to get PayPal to intervene to get my refund. It sure would be nice if there were actually a simple way to access customer support.",0
Kindly return back the like button,1
All my favourite music in one place. I particularly like the auto-generated playlists and the new artist suggestions.,1
when karaoke feature available?,1
Glitches. The music stops and starts constantly even in off-line mode. I love Spotify and use it daily but this is ridiculous. Could someone give an update on when the glitches will be remedied please?,0
Great auto-generated list of songs and music styles,1
I use to be a premium user for some reason I need to jump temporarily to the Free and advertise version I can confirm that this App hat the very best features to hate the free version Well done Sporty ,1
you need fix crashing problems on your app to renew itself software it stop playing my favorite song it get very annoying,0
It used to work great now anytime I hook it up to my car or any kind or speaker it completely bugs out.,1
"Hello Spotify. I'm experiencing something really bad in the app.. it was the best app for me until yesterday.. but now all out of sudden my playlists and songs have disappeared and I'm not able to search anything.. it says the app is unable to connect my Samsung Galaxy M30 device.. plzz look into the matter, thank you.",0
Update sucks. It freezes and still plays adds from Spotify on podcasts even when you pay for premium. Edit: almost a year later and the app still sucks.,0
"Great app, but it has a lack of informations about the artists and songs.",0
Its ok,1
I can get any songs I want an enjoy them while opening another app and make playlists but there is one problem. When I try to choose the song I want from my playlist it eon work but over all Spotify is amazing ðŸ‘!,1
"All my favourite music can been played here,thanks!",1
Goodbye Spotify. Not going to miss your service one bit.,1
"The last android playback update is trash , please bring the normal one back",0
"At first i gave this app a five star now i am giving it a three. Reason why because, whenever i want to listen to music it stop out of nowhere. My wifi is alright i tried to unistall and reinstall the app, it gave me the same problem. Please fix it.",0
"Worst app I have ever seen...!!!Even if there is full speed internet connection, app is not seem to play songs.....Had downloaded 4-5 times but songs are not playing....Very much disappointed with this app...(There is not option of 0 star, otherwise I would rate this app a big 0)",0
3rd class app ever... I loved this app earlier... But nowadays adds are everywhere... Nowadays the 30mins add free listening is gone too...It comes once in many days... I have great Idea turn off the app even from background when the add starts and click again on the app you can hear that song it will continue where the song began without any problems of 30secs add... How is it Spotify my brotherðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜ðŸ˜?,0
Used to work fine in my car with spotify auto connecting but since the recent updates which coincides with spotify car thing release it no longer works. Installing an older version fixes it so I think I will be cancelling my subscription if spotify thinks this is acceptable.,0
"Exceptionally good, especially if you are a Christian and you want uninterrupted worship go premium. No regrets. Many podcast devotions and other to choose from.",1
Awesome app for music! Excellent algorithm for song queue. All competitors should take note!,1
"Decent. The algorithms for making daily mixes can be super repetitive, even when you try to like or move liked songs into your own playlist. There really should be a dislike button instead of a ""hide song from the playlist "" function because that song will later show up in another playlist. User interface is nice and easy to use.",0
"Hate the update, more difficult to find songswhen searching saved library. Latest update is even worse! Playing no play bar won't stop playing",0
It's cool with all the features it has the only problem is that its a disadvantage to some of us who do have credit card or debit cards to pay for other options that are there and also please allow as to choose our own songs the shuffle play sometimes do not work for me I like playing my favorite songs not you choosing what I want to play is cool make some changes please,0
"I love this app i found the music i love plus first month free then a little extra charge but i keep playing my music non stop, thank you Spotify...",1
"Even after updating, there are so many songs that simply won't play. Of the ones that do play, many pause after roughly 20 seconds of play and do not play regardless if what I do.",0
"spotify shouldnt add songs to playlists for you, its really annoying and they should make it a setting.",0
Awesome! Great playlists and podcasts. Shortcut on lock screen is a game changer. I'm,1
This was a great app. But what has been going on? It just stops and then it just starts. Randomly. My phone tells me all the time that spotify's trying to play when I don't even have it open on my phone. I have uninstalled the app and reinstalled it several times and that does not help. Somebody please figure this out and fix it!,0
Been Spotify user since several years now I use it every single day It has changed how I listen and discover music Also the new genre tag story thingy works great Pstt I am an Android developer and would love to work for Spotify,1
Excellent site for music l like,1
"Improve the download feature, we should be able to download specific songs instead of the entire album or playlist",0
Worst shuffle in the league. I have tons of songs downloaded but Spotify plays the same songs over and over again. I have tons of songs downloaded that hasn't even been played yet on shuffle. Need to fix asap,0
Good app and many good choices they have a playlist for all your favorite artist and those playlist play the artist,1
love what I can listen to. I love the choice of music I can listen to and I like the preset choices made by Spotify of the music I listen to,1
Great variety of music for all tastes,1
"Can you please stop playing music automatically everytime I connect my device on bluetooth? All the settings from my phone ia set to not do it but this app ia very insistent. Very annoying and frustrating! Why don't you have stop button on your app, only play and pause?",0
How do you allow R-Kelly a literal and convicted pedophile on your platform but remove songs with titles deemed offensive (Let's get Retarded by the Black Eyed Peas for example but is not the only song) to a clean and uncensored versions to suit the snowflakes? Am I not paying to listen to music in its original state?,0
Nice listening to my all-time favorite music,1
not able to. load music not available on the app,0
The latest update messed up my app. The bar at the bottom of the screen that usually displays a playing song disappears. I cant stop a playing song without force quitting. The app is barely functional on my android.,0
Ok I've resorted to begging because it's literally impossible to make playlists without being able to hear a sample of the song in the add section. Please. Just add that back and I will give 5 stars thats all I want. Why would you take that away. The only reason I dont switch music apps is because of how many playlists I already have at this point. BLEH. the bare minimum has been restored.,0
Constantly have to keep closing and reopening the app because the music playback controls don't always appear. Also having connectivity issues casting my music to Google home. This is literally the only music streaming I use. Please provide a speedy fix.,0
Good,1
"#JRE is truly the only reason I use Spotify. Pretty good, you can find and listen to almost anything. Ads stink, especially the ads from Spotify trying to get me to pay for premium so I don't have to listen to ads.",0
This app is great as it makes play lists depending on what you've listened to before and generally puts together a good list for you to listen to.,1
"Used to be wonderful, now always crashes. Won't pop up the album view to scroll through songs, sometimes won't stop, will play random songs for no reason. Hopefully fixed soon or I will unsubscribe.",0
THIS IS THE BESTT AHHHH!!!ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜IT HAS THE BEST SONGS plus you don't need to download a music downloader,1
"It's all good now but sometimes, the podcast/music from the recommendation list doesn't really work well in terms of the list. Keep up the good work to the team!",0
I like it it plays what I want to hear the music I like to hear you know it plays continually even if I cut the phone off so I do like this app a lot Recommend it for everyone,1
Signed up for the 3 month free offer and twas good but there's your ads yet. Don't want music to be inserted with ads,0
I have gone back to the free option but I'm older so ads don't bother me. The new music I've been introduced to through Spotify has been pretty great for the most part and now I can sing the correct ðŸ¤­lyrics to my favourite choons!ðŸ‘,0
Nice app,1
I can't get lyrics.... I have tried everything to get lyrics... Otherwise no problem with this app... I will uninstall it now...ðŸ˜Œ,0
I like the convenience that I get instant access to any track I have shazamed.,1
"I do like spotify, once you have a premium account, you can get most if not all the songs that you are looking for. The Music quality is always at a very good standard. the songs that spotify Selects for you as songs related to What you are playing are very good and provides you with songs and artists which are new to me and they expand my musical knowledge. The only downer with the Spotify app is that I used to be able to use a DJ app to do mixing. Such a miss. This is the reason for 4 stars.",1
Recently going down fast. Basically giving it a few days chance and planning to cancel my paid subscription the app has become so buggy,0
When you listen to the songs that you know the listening of the songs are so good that you can start singing,1
A true plasure to use for music lovers of all kinds!,0
Spotify is trash I on have an account because its the only option on PS4,0
"Using spotify free, very happy with range of music, podcasts etc, ads aren't too intrusive but would prefer a greater range of ads as they often play the same ones back to back.",1
"Best Streaming platform ever!! Perfect if you have the premium, still good otherwise but ads are not my thing! 10/10 for me.",0
"Them making a big deal over Joe Rogan and Neil Young, got my curiosity up about Spotify so I thought I'd give it a try. I've never tried it before until yesterday. I'm so glad they got my curiosity up though because I love Spotify. I found a lot of my favorite singers and some of my favorite podcasts too. Stay as you are & don't give in to their politics. The only changes we need is improvements to the app when it's needed. The app works great too. I love it. Keep up the good work â˜ºï¸ .",1
"Ever since they resolved the issue with ad injection in podcast, things have been much better. There are a couple app crashes now and then but otherwise I enjoy it",1
"Strongly pushing for subscribers. Free version used to be decent, and now barely useable with ads at every step (switching screens, changing playlists, between each step, pausing and restarting, **any step**). So much that I finally signed up with premium trial. Premium is great; tried to find an alternative with as playlists and songs, and it doesn't exist yet. Not sure I'll pay yet, or find a YouTube mix, or listen to radio after the trial.",0
"Normal version ( without the premium ) the ads are very annoying but after taking premium version of Spotify, I am so satisfied with the sound quality plus you can the download the songs to listen offline. I AM GRATEFUL THAT I SELECTED SPOTIFY AS MY MUSIC APP, thank you Spotify.",1
"works fine, best music app",1
I love the playlists tailored to what I listen to...awesome!! Update: Been listening to spotify for awhile now...still loving it. I left for a minute and came roght back. I tried other music apps but spotify is my all time favorite. Thanks Spotify ~you rock!!!!!,1
"Loved the app till this last update. The app barely works now: my music plays randomly, stops when the screen goes off, can't see what song your playing, no listening bar on my lock screen. Clearly didn't do enough dev testing before the last update.",0
"I use to love this app. To me, it use to be one of the best music apps. But after last update, it has gone down hill. Now when I listen to a playlist it will just start playing random music and then start the playlist over again. I use to never have any problems. Now it is full of bugs. Until it gets fixed, I won't be using it anymore. Until it is fixed, I wouldn't recommend it to others either.",0
"ON NO DAY EVER SHOULD, 2PAC: HIT'EM UP, B ON, THEN RANDOM PLAY, PLAYS, POLKA/COUNTRY. IN NO WORLD R THOSE EVEN A LIL SIMILAR! App was close to 5 stars. IDEA, go back 4-5 updates & leave it. Undo the Updates/Changes, or try again, even.Not worth the $ right now. Basically,updates from Oct-ish/21-Feb/22 SUCK. Now while connected to BT, any notification while listening, it turns my volume down & doesn't fix itself unless,I close app, shut off BT,then reconnect everything. PLZ Fix the bugs.",0
Very badly in offering and didn't UNDERSTAND marketing and expensive,0
Nice,1
Hello i love this app Been using for 3months but why is the Spotify showing up whenever I play Timber (by Pitbull) on my computer it shows up . Thanks :),1
"Please give us the option to disable the album art on the lockscreen, it's so annoying",0
love most of the features in the app but one thing is a bit expensive at each month subcription for $9.90,0
"Awesome! Thank you so much for such a wonderful app, i can listen any music and podcast i want. Thank you developer for free, you have a big heart.",1
I love the app and the wide variety of listening choices.,1
I love Spotify good app to download,1
"App has been crashing a lot since the last update, also the play bar is not there at times.",0
I love this app I always listen to heartstopper soundtrack and live it!!,1
it's okay but why does everything need to be premium? like we can't even pick the song we want it's in shuffle and they add random songs.. worst,0
Awesome app love it to bits...,1
Spotify is the only app that has everything .,0
I really like this app because I'm the type of person who likes to listen to music when studying so this keeps me a little more happy :),1
The mostly lovely music app i have ever seen. My weekly mixtapes always drive me crazy. Am in love ðŸ’•,1
  3  2        3   1 ,1
Great app. Love the music and podcasts.,1
"Constant crashing. Currently its been crashing a lot more. I have been a long time spotify user and I hope they fix it soon, once they do get to fixing it its a 5/5 stars",0
"The app straight up DOES NOT FUNCTION on Xiaomi phones. Volume is low, the app is buggy, and whether it'll actually open or not is down to the flip of a coin. This has been a problem for YEARS now, for the love of god FIX IT.",0
Best pod cast and music,1
"Good for podcasts, use anything else for music, you can't even listen to the song you want with out having to listen to other ones not even remotely close to the same music type. Just why?",0
Good music at all time,1
I have a bug or maybe a setting problem my songs in my playlist keeps mixing when played . The songs play shuffled even though shuffle is turned off. Wt i actually mean is my first song is montero the second is someday so after montero ends it starts playing some other song and not someday......... Plss help me with thisðŸ™ðŸ»,0
A recent update ruined the group session. Please dont touch things when they work great.,0
Best app I pay for. All my music lives here and it's hard to find music. ðŸ¤ŸðŸ¤Ÿ,0
"App has bugs that haven't been addressed for weeks. Come on, why are we paying for this?!",0
"About a 2 years ago, the app began to randomly stop the song or podcast that was playing. When it is really bad, it will stop the song every ten seconds. I have tried everything from disconnecting all Bluetooth devices, to clearing cache, and reinstalling the app. It happens on all devices. Have found no solution and will likely be seeking another music service.",0
This app is awesome you can find a lot of songs here before have using another app to hear music but I can't find lot of songs there but here I could find a lot of music what I have searching for but one or two songs are not here like ''so many things I do and girl'' please add those songs.,1
"I have used almost every music provider except apple's music. So, I can say that the differences in audio quality are barely noticeable but the usability differs. For example, here in Spotify, you can stream music from one place to different devices, can add sleep timers, recommendations are better than the competition and, the number of content is huge, added to that there is a windows app that works seamlessly. App experiences are good, if it gets any bugs; it gets fixed in the next update.",1
No issue and encountered eversince I installed this app super users friendly and was to link to my car and bt speaker.,0
You can't listen to a song you search up without spotify shuffling in more. I wanted to listen to the song I searched not these random others. Kinda defeats the purpose of a music listening spoof you can't play the song you want.,0
"The music player is randomly disappearing on pixel 6, I have to force close the app and reopen to get it to return. Very bizarre",0
Tooo much ads inside this app,0
"Buggy. This app has gotten so bad it's almost unusable. Search takes like 5 seconds, and the app's just buggy in general ðŸ—‘ï¸ðŸš®",0
So I'm getting mad because every time I look up a song I WANT TO HEAR a different SONG PLAYS IDK HOW TO TAKE IT OFF BUT PLEASE TAKE IT OFF OR I'M DELETEING THE APP JK but fr please look into it.,0
"Ive had my account disabled with this message ""Your payment provider recently recalled an unauthorised payment for Spotify Premium. WeÂ´ve now returned the funds and disabled your Spotify account."" even though my bill isn't due anytime soon and I've already payed my last month bill and i never even called my bank about this Edit: my account has been recorded but even though I already have payed & my bank gave me proof of last month's payment I'm being made to pay again to access my premium why?.",0
it's good but y'all over exaggerating with them darn ads,0
Remove ods on Spotify Although I have premium I have to listen to app. Remove it,0
We have so much fun on spotify. Great stuff,1
Good,1
"Absolutely amazing! I got family plan and my whole family loves to listen their favorite music from Spotify. Audio quality is superb and very easy to use. Edit: I can't open notifications anymore, it just says try again and it's very annoying. I have Spotify premium Individual.",0
Good service and excellent music selection,1
I hate how you have to get premium just to listen to music 9 bucks just to listen to the music I like. And if your 14 day trial ends you can't see your music and can't decide if you want to listen to depending on your mood. I wish that it could go back to normal when you had your 14 day trial. ðŸ˜ž,0
Personally i only like to listen to like pumped up kicks i need a docter or maybe been there done that the songs that YouTube cant miniscreen for so when i put them in a playlist i only specification NOT ANY OTHER SONG THAT ISN'T IN THE PLAYLIST I MADE to be put in there i only want to listen to my song and or songs now the main problem i have with Spotify is not its ads i can handle ads but what makes me lose my temper is that they add other songs to your playlist would not recommend.,0
I Trying to play a song on my liked Playlist and I'm only hearing the preview of the song I have to press the shuffle button just to listen to my music.,1
Updated: had to update to one star after I get an ad after every song! Old review: The app works greatbut no way to skip the ads especially when they are all unrelated and untargeted. Why the hell would I care about mental health and all that jazz for snowflakes? They just spam you to death with unrelated stuff. I never got one targeted ad in my years of use...,0
Great app listen to it all day everyday,1
"I hate the fact you cant have ur own playlist without it adding songs! And why cant i listen to just a song, not one like it first?",0
All good except it doesn't contain some of the great music covers that you can find on YouTube and that the only reason for my 4 star rating.,0
"This is waste app always get addds , so please don't install this app",0
Love you guys always and forever. Your the music streaming platform I go to every time. Peace and love.,1
"It's cool, I use it all the time. Only thing is, like 3/5 times I use the app the play bar disappears and I have to force close the app to get it working again. I'm on a fresh s21 with barely anything on it. So I shouldn't have this problem I don't think. EDIT: I think the update fixed it.",0
It mostly plays fine. Small gaps sometimes and for what ever reason I can't get it to show up on my lock screen anymore,0
Easy to use. With lyrics. Without ad. Awesome app.,0
Everything in this app is okay but ads are the major issues .. I m not saying to close it but decrease the timings ......,0
"Spotify working very bad connected via Bluetooth in the car! I have Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus. Bluetooth version - 5.0, A2DP.... the music constantly breaks, stops and begins. Is there a solution to this problem?",0
I can't play my play list because it as songs I never added,0
Ver good for various music types.,1
"The app has been running quite smoothly, expect the last three months, I open the app and there's music ""playing"" meanwhile my player says it's paused (car player). Restarting Spotify seems like the only viable option, clearing my queue and starting from a random song or the last played one, seems random. If this still persists I would rather use YouTube music or other audio streaming platform.",0
"30 mins of add free music is a joke, you will get 3 maybe 4 songs if your lucky.",0
Very good app I can listen to all my favourite songs but the premium is expensive and it is a shame you can't peek at the next song but I love this app :),1
Music is good and podcast I'm ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
"The app was working fine but now I can't seem to download any music and it is on a premium family account. Every time I try to download a song, album or playlist, it downloads until a certain point and then it just loads. I've tried transferring the data to my SD card numerous times and I have deleted and reinstalled Spotify numerous times and the problem still doesn't go away. Please look into what may be causing this type of problem to occur.",0
"Your app is stupid. I can't even replay a song, and I have to listen to the song once. Do better.",0
Almost 50 songs have DISSAPPEARED from my Liked List!!! Could you at least notify when some songs/artist sorting or anything happened so we can get ready????,0
Great App,1
"I love Spotify and have used it forever and even upgraded to Spotify Duo. However despite being up to date on updates, it's super glitchy. Sometimes the music randomly stops. When I pull down my bar from the top sometimes there is just a empty space where my music should be. I plug in headphones? Sometimes it just starts music. The WORST one I've noticed is sometimes it randomly turns the volume ALL THE WAY UP. I'm going to go deaf!",0
I love this app i love how you can play any song you want! But the ads are annoying. I usally get 10 ads in a row. 10! Way to many! but other than that amazing app lol,0
"No idea why trying to search for songs in your 'liked songs' is so difficult, I shouldn't have to scroll up to search. Also why tf can't I rearrange my songs in the ""liked songs"" section. Seems foolish to not include that at an option...",0
Best for music online/offline. Better than Amazon prime music,1
Spotify is awesome!... that is all,1
"Just another way to be spied on by people with ðŸ’© intentions- I miss the 80s You can laugh, but at least our every move isn't on candid camera, all our likes & dislikes are monitored. Technology is a donkey. Wait, that's mean to donkeys... You get the point- Enjoy your shower! May as well do it on the front lawn!!!! ðŸ¤ª",0
Far too many ads. Ruins your listening experience.,0
Me encantan los diferentes generos de Musica,1
Some songs doesn't show lyrics even though they used to show before.. please fix it,0
"Lots of ads, very unhappyðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž",0
New update has caused app to freeze alot. I pay for premium but have to listen to adds on most podcasts i listen to,0
"Do not buy premium. You still get ads for podcasts. It is not the podcasts' ads, they are supplemental ads that go straight to spotify. On top of that, they have overoptimized this just like every other app. Convenient to switch from car play to non car play, only problem is the floating button is placed right over the play button for a song or album. These overlooked problems are everywhere. Buttons on top of buttons, settings not saving, network not updating. I cant justify $9.99/month anymore",0
It has so many ads in it every 3 or 4 songs two ads comes and iterupt the listening ðŸŽ§ it is not a good app for listening songs . Thanku,0
"It's alright, I just don't know what to say but I know something isn't intriguing me. I don't know I think old Spotify is better ðŸ¤”",0
Worst it has a major bug whe song cannot be displayed in the bottom and even get freezeed in one song but the next song keep playing,0
Great when it works - has lots of glitches.,1
"It used to be a 5 star app but, now there are too many adds consecutively. You can listen to 2 songs and then you gotta listen like 4 adds......its disgusting.",0
"Love Spotify, it's on all day everyday!!!",1
It's a good app which recommends you songs based on your interests(most of the time i hate em) And you get ads like every 4-5 songs okay cool. AND WHY THE HELL CAN'T I SHARE MY LIKED SONGS KA PLAYLIST!!? And i think there should be a feature so select multiple songs so that you can add multiple songs to another playlist instead of selecting each one which honestly consumes a lot of time,1
"This app is a great platform for listening your favourite music. As I'm a BTS army this app is so good for me. It gave me perfect blend for me + BTS. I loved this app. No for only k-pop it's a great app for bollywood, Hollywood,punjabi and many other language songs. Thanks Spotify for this amazing facilities. And I hope you'll improve it more ( it's already a great app)...",1
It worked great up until i couldnt access my liked songs catalog. Ive teued everything the helo blog recommended. No luck.,1
i use it only for 2 days and buy a premium account and now i cannot open it. What's happening????!!,0
amazing,1
"Loved it up until lately when it won't shut down. If I can't figure it out, I will be deleting and cancelling my subscription.",0
"They have very good taste in music, but I'm having a hard time finding only one thing. They have a great library.",0
Mad tunes just needs a bit more local music from unrecognised artists,0
new update bugged. mini player disappearing and not working.,0
Allows me to play some songs that I want to listen for free and I can listen while my phone is off,0
I love this app I get so calm whenever I lsitent I music,1
"i cant play music from albums only from my liked songs playlist- even after restarting the app, logging off or turn off my phone. this is absolutely ridiculous please fix what ever this is.",0
"It's a place for music. Usually it doesn't let me down, the ads get annoying sometimes but other than that it's a good app. I'd recommend.",1
"It used to be amazing but now nothing ever loads whenever I click on my likes, artist, Playlist, etc. I thought it was my phone but its still happening.",0
Nice,1
The best music app.. I would definitely recommend using it u can also listen to podcasts soo I really enjoy using Spotify,1
The music used to be good but not anymore. I would have considered renewing at a later date but cancellation of the premium service was needlessly difficult.,0
"App is extremely glitchy. Thought it was my phone and/or my poor internet but NOPE. After reading all these posts I see my experience is the same as others. So much for adding a Premium account, no thank you. 7/22 Pretty much the same as above. Still glitchy. Still no premium upgrade desired. Thanks though.ðŸ‘",0
"Spotify just has too many adds, these guys beg for us to buy Spotify premium. What's wrong with you guys ? 'Gaana' gives us free music and minimal adds. It's my suggestion to the people that DO NOT INSTALL SPOTIFY, you will listen to adds rather than music. It's literally an app for ADDs and not for music. These guys even made variations in their advertisments as some days back, they were vigourously trolled for their annoying adds. Comeon Spotify, stop begging for premium !",0
"I absolubtly hate how im trying to listen to a playlist ive created and spotify just desides to play suggested songs over and over and over and over i cant even listen to the music on my playlist because all of these bullsh*t songs that play one after another i want to enjoy my music without getting these god damned interuptions while listening, I dont have the money to get premium its just so annoying and im better off listening to music on youtube not youtube music just search it up on youtube",0
This app has all my songs I like yay!,1
I would give Spotify 5 starts if only it would just play the music I want and not random bs and yes I made a Playlist but I still would like to play the song I want when I want not my Playlist at random,1
I would give 5 stars but when I Play my favorite songs it doesn't play my favorite ones it puts random bad songs :(,0
Such a wonderful application. I always get what I want to listen. I am truly impressed with this music platform.,1
"Great app, I think the database of available music awesome and unmatched elsewhere. After this you probably won't need another service. Price seems reasonable too!",0
I love Spotify,1
"The best place to listen to music, still amazing without premium. If you do want the best possible experience, premium is very cheap. Spotify is the only place anyone should listen to music or podcasts from.",0
Love the playlists that I can create for myself,1
Best streaming platform I've used soo far,1
A great music app to listen to any song other than the one you want to listen to Type in a song you want to hear Spotify will play a completely different one Make a Playlist of songs Spotify will add songs for you and only play those songs HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT DOWNLOADING THIS APP,1
Very good music app with no ads!,1
"That's like 6 long ads in a row now as i am typing this review, still not hearing the songs yetðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸... no need to say more",0
Great but I get adds every 30 min so if I'm trying to listen to my 3hr playlist I wil have to listen to 6 adds and that is a lot.,1
Excellent experience it's one of its kind among the apps I have come across keep up doing the good work,1
what the hell is with this connect feature??? im connected to a device on the same wifi and now i cant play my own music?? this is ridiculous!,0
Easy to use. Found old and new favorites,1
Its very good app I love,1
Wish I had more detailed control of the songs and the order they play,0
I'd be lost with out Spotify love it!,1
It is an awesome app for songs,1
It's just not good anymore. they keep removing features to try to get people to pay for premium. it's almost gotten unusable with how many ads I get. a few wouldn't be bad considering it's free but the amount of ads I get is absolutely excessive. and I'm absolutely sick of features being removed. I'm genuinely starting to hate this app despite using it for years. I'm getting fed up.,0
"Does not play a song that is requested, instead it plays what spotify thinks is a simular song that i did not want to hear at that moment. Very frustrating.",0
"Garbage. Spotify sucks at playing music. Several years paying for this app and it still has no idea what music I enjoy. If I ask my Google home to play a specific song off of spotify, it won't do it most of the time. Unacceptable for a paid service.",0
"Been really buggy lately! I've been using Spotify for years and the last month or so it has been super buggy. It stops playing at random, won't show what's playing in the app, pauses at random and sometimes the controls built onto my buds don't work to play/pause.",0
Love to listen on dis app..ðŸ˜ƒ And de lyrics r also dere so easy to learn also if any competition is held for singing.... Loved it... But de thing is tat dere are many many ads if we've not in the premium... Else everything good enough for dis app as it is to listen songs... I don't think dis rewiew will be taken in consideration but if it is den i appreciate tat.. Regards.,1
"Spotify is excellent! They did it well. However, some podcast are bs, but that is not their fault I guess.",1
"It has so much music, great variety, and I use it all the time. I love Spotify, its awesome!",1
How can I preview songs to see if I will like them? I'm not gonna wait how many songs just to play one song if I don't even like it yet. Also I'm free plan user. Pls add back the preview.,0
I use all the time try SOAD they are great,1
I love this app but everytime i play my playlist it changes to songs that i dont know or have on my playlist.,0
I absolutely love Spotify I can find all the music I love and need it makes my day happy!! ðŸ˜ðŸ’¯,1
"Trash you cant pick the song you want to hear instead have to hope the random selection will get the song you want. Pay the same price for youtube music and get everything from the artis, don't buy into spotify limitations.",0
I love how easy it is to use and I love having my different Playlist because I love all types of music ðŸŽ¶,1
Very useful app...so I can listen to all the songs that I like...,1
Recent bug with disappearing UI which needs app restart to get fixed makes Spotify really annoying to use.,0
Really loving this app especially with all the podcasts.,1
Buggy as hell. I have to force close it every time I open it,0
Entirely better than YouTube music for sure. Less annoying ads and you can listen while using another app.âœŒï¸ðŸ™‚,1
Any music or podcasts anytime anywhere!,0
"I love the app. Good user experience but i have a concern. I would have loved a shuffle button at the top when i open 'My Library' so i can shuffle songs including playlists, albums and downloaded songs altogether. Sometimes i like to listen to songs from different genre while carrying out a task. Doesnt have to be necessarily songs that have same sound. If that's done it will be a 5star for me. Great job guys.",1
"Honestly it would've been a 4 if the number of times my payments were rejected, kind of irritating",0
"Top quality massive variety of music , even rare stuff",1
Small bugs here and there that disappear after force stopping the app. Please try and fix them. Usually they appear after disconnecting from Android auto.,0
This is good for finding playlists and so much more ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†,1
I love the many podcast selections,1
Excellent app and has a lot of fun.,1
I love Spotify without Neil Young. I could do just fine without Joni Mitchell too.,1
Why am I paying for this app when it is currently a disaster. I am so upset with how badly it lags on android irregardless of how many times I clear cache. My music experience is impacted. I am considering to move to a different platform if this isn't fixed.,0
"It's awful, forcing people to get premium service to hear the songs you want is a new level of low.",0
Bro you have to pay to skip songs and you only get six. I think am going to YouTube now spotify is bullshiz,0
Too many glitchs. Stops working correctly very frequently!,0
Very easy and an enjoyable app to florish you with good hearings,1
Superb app very less ads i am happy ðŸ‘âœŒï¸,0
Used this for years now and I wont use any other music app <3,0
Was good. Started getting glitchy over last couple of months until it stopped working. Despite reinstalling ap. will change to someting else.,0
Spotify is ok but without premium it is not so good,0
Giving always adds,1
Wide range of songs with exceptional quality! Really enjoying AF..,1
The quality is good but the only problem is adds .... It contains a lot of adds plzz remove the adds,0
"All is fine, except the ads are at a much louder volume than the music. Do not appreciate ads blasting in my ear at that volume...",1
The widget has disappeared again and will not load when trying to place it.,0
Since the last Huawei system update the app has been presenting few mistakes regarding the widgets. It appears like you're not listening music even when the track is playing normally. By all the rest Spotify is still the best option but those things should be fixed.,0
"I love Spotify, but since about two weeks ago I have one big problem. I've been modifying my playlists as always, and when I want to listen to a preview of a song to add (inside the 'add songs' option), it is not longer working. And that tool was incredibly useful to explore and add songs that seemed to go with the playlists' style. I'm so upset about this, please, fix it!",0
pretty good but LYRICS WONT LOAD FOR MAJORITY SONGS,1
"This app was literally supposed to only play songs you love, not completely become unpleasant and unplayable. And you had to change because you apparently like money instead of having what you promised.",0
Always using Spotify apps and it's enjoying every day to lestining music,1
"I have been using the app since 5 years now, and frankly, it is a good app. But these days there are many problems with the app. Though I have purchased the premium package, I am not able to listen to the songs I want, or search for any song. It says something went wrong, or no internet connection. I waited for more than a year for the issue to get fixed. If this continues, I dont think I will renew my premium package anymore. There is no point since I cant listen to any songs.",0
Great music app to use but im switching to YouTube premium for more benefits and mainly because there are a couple songs I really like I accidentally hit the cancel button on so I can never play those songs again. Please make a way to check the list of those songs that were canceled and a way to uncancel them then I will get premium again Also premium cost way to much there should be a way to cancel the premium through the app. Unless you have premium i suggest another app,0
This app is amazing. I love how you can listen to music anywhere you go. 10 out of 10.,1
Come on now. Why does it have a couple of minutes to move my downloaded music onto my SD card but then takes close to 6 hours for the app to open? Also theirs tines when my downloads delete and I have to do everything again.,0
Best song streaming platform and also we never forget about podcasts,1
I've been a premium member for a long time. But now i'm trying log in it says not connected to wifi when my wifi service is perfectly well. When i try to share the music it also says my spotify is offline.,0
"Excellent variety of music tracks, nothing you search you can't find ! I love this app",1
I enjoy it especially listening artist from my country,1
I love Spotify! Definitely my favorite! Especially premium. So awesome. Thank you guys for doing such a great job!!!,1
"Song radio not working, just states playlist deleted. Will cancel subscription immediately.",0
"The new update is super buggy. Songs keep stopping randomly. Also there's no player view where I can pause, skip ahead, etc. The app is pretty much unusable.",0
The best all sound music you ever wanted to hear is here. Love it ðŸ’•â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,1
Thisnapp is top notch but the problem is the ads.Sometimes it give 3 ads in a row just stop it 1 ad is enough for the best compony you have than any other.,0
You'd think a company this large could make an app that doesn't have a new bug every month,1
Nice app I like it,1
After this new update I'm not able to play a particular song as such this is making it very hard to play the songs i want to play The whole operation of this app has changed and it's not pleasing at all I'm also not able to play a particular song in loop or repeat :// Pls bring back the older version its way better,0
"This is SO GOOD, the only annoying thing is that you have to pay, but it deserves it",1
"I use my account every day, but today the mobile app just stopped working. I updated it and nothing. I uninstalled and then reinstalled it, twice, and nothing. It just sits there with a black screen and won't load.",0
"Why am I paying? Constant problems for the last 3 years, it likes to delete all your downloads at really annoying times, like when you are out of signal camping or on a long haul flight.",0
App is good but most of the time it just stops responding i use Spotify on daily basis and on every second day i faced this issue that app lags and stops responding and sometimes it doesn't show the music controls when i tap to play music I'm a premium member so what's the point of subscribing to this service if these kind of issues keep happening please fix this,0
"The app is encouraging the spread of scientific misinformation, notably about COVID-19. I don't want to encourage that kind of stuff so.. I'M OUT.",0
Good Music quality and less ads good app,0
"So Inconsistent. Sometimes it works great, but most of the time it is glitching out, stopping my music randomly and not allowing me to use the queue. Such a joke considering this is a paid subscription, I should be getting a refund for the last year of this BS.",0
It was good for 1 Yr but recently spotify keeps saying no internet is available.. though ny internet connection is good in other apps.. I have reinstalled the app. Connected a different internet.. cleared clache.. but still it says no internet available.. kindly fix this problem,0
Great but hate the ad,0
Great for music,1
It is an amazing appðŸ˜Ž .....ðŸ¤”first you download then you can seeðŸ¤« how the app is working......ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,1
"This is the worst app for podcasting, awful at downloading, awful at offline listening. Awful for podcasts. Always sucks at downloading, never stays where I left off. The offline mode sucks. Skipping through ads starts the episode back over. Wish Rogan never made a deal with you guys. Never have an issue with Google podcasts Update 2022, still the worst podcast app I have to use. Wouldn't use it if it wasn't for Rogan",0
I am a premium subscriber. Keeps crashing for me since a recent update a week or so ago. Sometimes takes upwards of 10 mins just to get the app open.,0
"Playback of local file doesn't work well. Many times it doesn't even start. And when it works it doesn't play the next file in the folder. Instead, it plays something else from the local library!!! May be because I don't have premium membership and I don't want to go as far as that (provide credit card details for the service that I am unlikely to use).",0
"Pointless unless you want to pay, you can't actually listen to the songs in your playlist and it randomly plays songs that you never added, guessing because you don't have the premium version.",0
YAYYY IM SO GLAD THEY ADDED BACK THE FEATURE I REALLY LOVE SPOTIFY EVEN IF IT HAS ADS,1
"It's a very nice app for songs, playlists,podcast, stories and much more ,that's my thinking",1
"When my playlist song is done, it started playing random suggested song and wont play back my playlist. It is annoying and I also recieve alot of ads after just listening to a song from my playlist",0
Can select zsong i want and enjoying litsening..,1
EA for music industry,1
Algorithm is lovely (except the endless harvest moon covers (pls stop)),1
Sad some of my favorite artists left and their reason for leaving. I can only give four stars.,0
It adds song to your playlist and still plays them after you remove them. Its annoying and stupid. And it wont let me pay with my google account too.,0
excellent,1
Control bar keeps disappearing so you can't play pause or advance forward or go back. Requires you to exit and restart the app. Sometimes the app just keeps playing even if you exit out requiring you to restart your phone. Huge pain. Seems like a paid subscription app shouldn't be so buggy.,0
Spotify isn't the same as it was. There's constantly to many ads. I like using this app whenever I'm in the mood to hear music that's actually great. Overall after the ads its a great app to use.,0
"Spotify is the best on PC and Tablets, It's skipable and perfect when your listening on your home, for phone and mobile devices... Well just fix your own playlists to only play your fav songs, you can't play single songs so it's also difficult to learn a song you want to sing unless you go to third party music/video sites. The rest, it's already perfect even if you don't have premium, it's just how you use it!!",1
Absolutely love this app. Been a premium user for years and I don't think I'll ever switch. The only reason I've given it 4 stars is because of the Android widget. It really needs an update.,0
"About 90% of the app space is wasted on useless podcast recommendations when I just want to listen to music. It becomes a pain to actually get to my playlists. There should be a separate app for music and podcasts, then I might actually use that. Or just let me pin things or hide content from the front page. Also, the app shows annoying popups to invite other people to buy premium, really ruins the experience",0
It is really an fantastic platform to listen music in anytime or any mood.. Any language songs are available .. I will choose Spotify to relax everytime I really enjoying Spotify ðŸ˜‰,1
Just awesome app for music lovers,1
"Tbh I love Spotify, I use it in every area of my life. Online and Offline, at work, at home, on vacation. It has everything I can think of plus more, from childhood nostalgia to new tunes dropping daily and I love that they make me mixes based on what I listen to. The algorithm is on point.",1
"Honestly, I love it. I don't have to keep loading songs in phone memory. Recently added Kenyan songs are awesome & nostalgic",1
EXCELLENT ,1
Veey nice app,1
Good,1
"I pirated my music for years, now I don't have to because it's all on spotifys search bar easier. This is the way",0
I love this app I use it every day to calm me down But all the sudden my music Playlist wont let me listen to my music Please fix this asap Thank you,1
What's the point to keep on sending me e-mails about lyrics and nothing is available? The user experience seems to keep getting worse... Might be time to transfer my subscription to another music app.,0
I absolutely LOVE this app! Thanks for giving everyone a voice!,1
"Terrible UX with search and while offline. Says I'm offline all the time, so, I can't use the app for new songs... Update: now songs play but no controls are shown. Really an annoying bug.",0
It has the greatest music ever keep it up ðŸ‘,1
I've been paying for premium for awhile. I Over 1000 song and it will only shuffle through 20 of them at best. The app is getting stupid glitchy. I've uninstalled and made sure it's up to the latest update. Dudes what's going on? I've love this app but it's starting to wear my patience.,0
My debit card was lost and I missed a payment. Added new card and I was upgraded to premium duo though ever since downloading this app I have always used premium. Had to log in to the website version to change back to my usual version. Was a hassle and sneaky not Spotify to do that. Enjoy that additional $3!!! Whilst I am at it the navigating of podcast is ridiculous not to mention you still get ads in your podcasts despite Parcast states add free and exclusive to Spotify...pfftt.,0
Best song app i ever seen,1
I love this app and everything it has but its been crashing way too much lately,0
Enjoy listening to not just songs but podcasts from allover the world.,1
Definitely one of the best music apps out there! I would also recommend to get Spotify premium definitely worth it no adds,1
"I have been using this app since around 2018 and I would say it is pretty good I don't have any complains. I don't have premium cause I'm just not going to pay for it, but I don't mind the ads either so yea.",1
This app went to garbage in just a week. Everything is buggy and terrible.,0
It's alright but not having the option to listen to a album in order an less you pay for premium kinda sucks,0
The new update took away the bar showing what song you are currently listening to which doesn't allow me to put it on repeat or change other settings on the song. Trash. Bring this back please and fix all other bugs like disconnecting from Bluetooth frequently.,0
Awesome! Best music streaming service by far!,1
Good,1
"This app is so bad I been reinstall it more than 9 time but my music is still not playing, it only show me to choose my music taste .and only playing adds not the music",0
"Use to work great. Now it doesnt react to inputs and gets stuck on past episodes on my android Update: Now when I open app it starts playing random music, but says its not playing anything so I cant stop it. Also will not let me fast forward or rewind program",0
"Been crashing like hell, I can barely use it. What's wrong??",0
Too much ads,0
"Portrait mode on the Samsung Galaxy S8+ doesn't show right. The play, shuffle, and other buttons are showing ontop of each other please fix!!!!",0
Audio quality setting if given in the music player itself will be good similar to the lite version.,0
Spotify got worse with the new update please change it,0
Best music streaming I've ever used ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
Pleasing to hear the list of songs to calm down our minds when it is stressed,1
It's absolutely amazing to listen songs on Spotify and am satisfied with it but the only thing I would like to mention (perhaps the reason why I gave only 3 stars) is that the amount of ad present in this app is very bad like they say to give uninterrupted music for 30 min after 1-2 ads but then again the ads pop up. I would like to tell you to limit the ads in this app. Overall this app is amazing for music lovers!,0
"I love this app, this app provided all types of song ,of I need pop,kpop ,Bollywood, tollywood etc all types of song are available in this app ..",1
I wish that you could add more widgets that can be resizable to make room on the smartphone or any other smart device.,0
Hosting podcasts that spread misinformation leaves a bad taste in the mouth. There are plenty of other music streaming services - Spotify now deleted.,0
Nice app also have bts as other k pop,1
What happen? Can't play my playlist properly,0
"I don't need to hear religious ads, skip option should be available. Keep ads neutral.",0
"I love it, there are tons of songs. The only thing I don't like is that u keep having to pay for premium, I wish it was a cheap one time thing yk?",0
The app simply didn't play songs I selected to listen to. It played others I didn't select.,0
Aadash kahar 1001,1
Easy to listen music,1
COOOL,1
the best app to use for listening to music,1
"Good choice of songs , better online music app",1
App is inconsistent and always messing up. Not only that but Pandora does a better job of picking music. And on top of that they have so much misinformation on this that's leading to people getting sick.,0
This is a good app for listening song and play game like I play bedwars game in Minecraft with this app,1
Thank you spotify 1,1
"Been a customer to Spotify for years, it's the perfect app for music ðŸŽ¶ imo",1
The latest UI is garbage. Nice having no ability to stop music or general play controls. Form over function. Update so now the controls have magically appeared again,0
From yesterday app is crashing when playing a song. I updated yesterday then it fixed. Again yesterday evening onwards app is crashing. Please fix it. Device is iqoo 7.,0
"I constantly have to re-download all my music. When I find something new to download, and I have a subscription, and phone has room, it always just spins and doesn't DL. I follow all the steps recommended and in the end I have to reinstall it, re download everything. F*$king pain in the a$$. If it didn't have such a large download limit, I'd have gone with YouTube instead. I miss Google music.",0
App works fine for me Everything was good until they requested a screenshot of the promotional advertising for it to be valid,1
why the pop up play-next button often to dissapear? it is so disturbing bc i cant turn off or skip forward the music,0
Horrible. Why can't I play a Playlist in order without premium. What's the use of calling it a Playlist if its always on shuffle?,0
"I really liked but I still wonder whats the algorithm for ""shuffle"" cause it isn't random enough.",0
Podcasts on Spotify sucks so badly. I wish they would stick to what they know or made another app for podcasts. This is the worst podcast experience,0
Clean platform easy to use :) (great job developers!),1
"Was good but now it just doesn't show what's playing, plays randomly in my pocket or car and constantly cuts out for 5 second intervals.",0
"Great listening experience, app works well, couldn't ask for more!",1
Loved this app. However I will appreciate being able to sample songs when setting up playlists again. This function hasn't been active in the recent updates.,0
It's really fantastic app! When I play song my mind was cool and fresh ness,1
Love it apart from constantly being told to go premium,1
Too many glitches lately. The app just stops in mid-play. I am considering on canceling my subscription.,0
Had it for about 10years and each update makes sense. At first your wondering why the hell they made the update but you realize it's only because the last one made you feel at home,0
TY NOW I CAN LISTEN EVERYDAY,1
"I recently got premium. And suddenly today everytime I'm streaming an album, after the first song the rest of the queue is full of random songs not from that album. Why is this happening?",0
They have to many ads. They were hertful and personal,0
Why can't I pause or stop a song from playing? This is ridiculous. I literally have to restart my phone to get the songs to stop playing. FIX THIS!!!!,0
best music streaming app in history,1
The enhanced feature on playlists singlehandedly makes spotify the hands-down only music app choice,0
This is a really good way to listen to music I like how it can connect to my Fitbit and how I could make play lists.,1
Tbh this app is insanely overated because whenever I try to play something it plays something else completely different and I cannot change it and without the premium subscription you can only skip 6 musics per hour ðŸ˜,0
I made a just want to listen to certain songs but it makes me listen to others before that. I made a Playlist and it added songs I've never heard into it. Kind of annoying.,1
This is the worst music app ever i put down two songs in a playlist so that i could put them on loop but no spotify wants to add songs to my playlist IM FINE WITH MY SONGS I DONT NEED COUNTRY MUSIC IN MY FNAF PLAYLISTS terrible one star,0
Awesome,1
I don't have any issues with spotify except something that's been getting on my nerves recently. Every single time I open the app it asks for Bluetooth permissions. No matter what I say. It's annoying,0
Pretty good app. Would be nice to be able to pin more than 4 playlists/albums,1
Trust me is the best music app so pay in order to enjoy to the fullest,1
Why does the app keep playing songs that I do not want to hear? I am clicking on a specific song and it keeps playing something different. Why?,1
Enjoyed my music on spotify.,1
Upgraded my phone to a s22 plus and now the option of seeing the songs that I have liked by a specific artist is gone. Now I have to search through the artists entire library to find what I want,0
What's up with Spotify it keeps cutting out when I'm listening to music and saying I'm not listening anything and I got premium,0
Keep getting random songs that are not even in my liked playlist is so annoying,0
"I wish this app had HD artist images in the background of an album art as a song plays. The way Microsoft groove music app had. Other than that, thanks for being a great all. Edit for 2022: Why have I dropped number of stars? My app continually crashes. The play, skip, pause buttons disappear randomly, and I have to force my phone to shut down. If this keeps happening, I am considering changing platforms because it is frustrating especially when I head to work.",0
Beat app for listening music. It is is to use and I like things like custom Playlist and selecting artist,1
"Newest update makes the app crash all the time. I can't even use it on my phone efficiently anymore and it's just sad when I pay a subscription every month for good music service. Oh, my ""Wrapped 2021"" still isn't fixed either even after talking to their IT for ages",0
"The most recent update as of 4/14/22 made this app almost unusable. Crashes are one thing, and they are here, but the app frequently won't pull up a control bar when playing music so I have no way to pause or adjust the track! The playback screen, the few times I was honored to use one again, would have the time dot go back to the beginning every time I paused the music, yet if I pressed play the music would pick up where it left off and the dot would start from the beginning!",0
it takes son long to update ande theres annoying adds,0
"Spotify isnt great anymore, I literally can't listen to playlists without a ""few"" songs being added I don't care much for the shuffle thing, but it's a blue moon for me to hear one of the songs I want to.",1
Nobody liked the new updateðŸ¥² there are a lot of videoes about new spotify and Im reading the comments nobody liked the new update neither did i. the old one was perfect for me,0
"please provide a feature so that the spotify widget can support transparent settings, so that it is tailored to their individual needs. Thanks.",1
"I'm only writing this review because when I selected my playlist it started a song I was craving to hear. (Without premium) Made my day, so I'd like to make Spotify's day.",0
Best part is the offline functionality. Because sometimes I have no service but I can still listen to my music.,1
Hey bro please make a widget like we can see lyrics on our screen... Like multitasking..!! This is a small advice like so many people want this...! just add this and overall I loved this app Thank you for making this app..ðŸ’–,1
"Whenever i play a song, it always stops at 9sec. I tried everything but still doesnt work.",0
Way too many ads. Plus the app UI has way fewer features than the full website.,0
Good app for any form of music,1
"My last review was very bad because the app stopped working. But you guys fixed the issues and now it works good, love my music on the go",1
Way to many adds I get 6 adds every 30 minutes do not recommend unless you pay for premium or don't mind adds,0
"Easy to use, fun, affordable",1
Pls bring the ringtone option..we need to set some songs as ringtone..,0
"Spotify. What is going on over there. Has this release been tested AT ALL ? The whole playing bar has dissapeared completely, so the only way to stop playing is to quit the app completely! Despite having offline play lists practically unusable when there is no Internet connection. Continually messing with UI which is now among the most unintuative you have released to date (your UX team obviously does not use the app!) I'm on the verge of moving to another streaming service!",0
Great selections and app is user friendly.,1
I just loved the app. It's just amazing and satisfactory. But the only problem is that they provide the lyrics of a particular song in the particular language. So I must say that they should provide the romanised lyrics in English so that everyone could get what the lyrics of song is actually...,0
My spotify is breaking up. Music stops when my screen is off. And then it continues to play when I turn it on. What the hell is wrong?,0
It's so cool to finally find a music that everyone enjoys- thank you so very,1
Best distributing app,1
"I hate you. With your political games you have deprived most of the music, I can't even go in and download my playlist. I had about four thousand track. And what now? Now I can't just go in and see the title of songs. Worst developers ever.",0
You can mostly find any song here..liked it very much,1
"I've been using Spotify for the better part of 6 years, and let me tell you, it's probably easily the best app for all your music needs, podcasts, All sorts of music, anything that satisfies your musical/Podcast tastes, Spotify is bound to have it. I highly recommend anyone and everyone to use Spotify, premium just makes it so much better, but seriously, if you don't have Spotify, why not? I could ramble on for another few hundred characters of Spotify, but it's a serious down to earth app!",1
Amazing music app,1
"Didntcare fir the 'default to shuffle play' feature. Now that I've figured out I can turn 'shuffle' off, much better. I can now play the tracks in the order I selected them.",0
"Has been flawless till now. I get no miniplayer, no music bar in my notifs so if I get out of my car after using Bluetooth my music just carries on playing with no way to stop it, although that doesn't matter because the music just randomly stops and then kicks back in again away. Remember kids if it's not broken don't fix it.",0
Very irritating. I want to stream music over mobile data and says no internet connection seriously....... Furthermore i am a premium user but still suffer. Please check on that as soon as you can.,0
Enjoy the music ðŸŽ¶... Keeps me upbeat..ðŸ˜‹ Never have enough of music,1
"i always had a good time with Spotify until recent updates has removed my profile, saved playlists and now not allowing to listen to songs of my choice unless I buy premium. Uninstalled now!! Such a shame.",0
nice variety of songs/music for all ages!,1
"Love the app so much!! I use it every day for everything I listen to !!! It would be nice if you could organize things more though, like folders or more pins to the top. Great app though !!!",1
Mine is not connecting with the internet and i just subscribe to premium my App is crashing,0
This is the worst app ever for music. Even I have 5g speed network and app showing no internet available.i am not able to listen song.,0
Best music you can find but not everything is available but I find what I need it just sometimes they lock the shuffle.,1
Way too many commercials even being a free trial offer just tells me have you guys run your business I'd really like to enjoy it years ago you barely had commercials and I was with you,0
Bruh tf is this huh like every other song there's a freaking ad trying to convince me to upgrade . Just download the moded version of Spotify . It might not have much updates but atleast it doesn't interrupt,0
Used daily other than adverts everything is good tried to get premium but so far it won't let me very odd,0
its not to be okay its dont show the lyrics and the song we can not listen it again SORRY to say  but SPOTIFY is really its was good but now,1
When lock screen kicks in Spotify stops playing Issue began two days ago with new update. Not impressed.,0
"Very good music, good variety.",1
The app works pretty seemlessly with my home and google devices. Sometimes it will slip music in to playlists that are VERY far off from my preferred repertoire. It's annoying but fortunately doesn't happen often.,0
"Any song, anytime, anywhereðŸ¥°",1
I listen to this app at least 11 hours a day I love it,1
The best 1000 percent u can find any song and music,1
"Won't load songs. Before that issue I couldn't, ""LIKE"" any Christian songs, yet I could LIKE any other songs. Odd. I can't unfollow artists on phone or on computer. It's getting worse by the day. Reinstalled it several times. I'm a premium customer for years now. Might have to leave.",0
On Android device player controls disappear all the time. Have to close and reopen app multiple times a day to he able to stop/play or see the previous/next treck buttons,0
An app that can't play a song we like for free at the time we want is useless,0
"My app will not work at all and hasn't been working for easily a week now. It logged me out and keeps saying I am not connected to the internet (I clearly am, everything else works). I have disconnected and even just used my phone instead of wifi and it still did not work and said the same thing. What's going on? I have updated the app and nothing has changed??",0
"i deducted two stars since there are way more ads in the free plan than they promise and their shuffle feature always messes up repeating the same songs which is really annoying but its still the best music listening app by far due to the library, quality, interface, etc. just some very minor technical problems like the play/pause button glitching in app sometimes and becoming a white circle but nothing earth shattering and these also only occur if your device is a old one like mine.",0
Overall chad app but like could u add an option to buy Spotify premium from google play redeem card,0
It is an amazing app. All the songs are available in this app. Very nice app for listening to music.,1
paid customer since 2015. Latest Android update broke something and now Spotify quits all the time when using other apps like Waze and Lyft Driver. What happened?,0
"The song quality is good but on free, if you press a song, it doesn't play that song. It plays something of the same theme. The only way to listen to what you want is a already made playlist.",0
Dude I hate how you can't just play one song and you can't go back on play lists you have to finish that song once you start it if you don't have any more skips this app has changed alot and I hate it,0
"It doesn't work properly. Constantly shuts off middle of songs, the play bar doesnt show, fed up with it honestly. Gonna switch to a diff music streamer",0
"Loved the app for a while, then I opened it to listen to my Playlist and the app no longer let's me play that Playlist and it added a bunch of songs to it. Mildly disappointed.",0
App does not work on Wifi. Is this a joke?,0
Happy,1
Won't show what's it's playing and how far you are into a song or podcast. Randomly stops when no ones pressed a button even with screen off ðŸ˜’ ðŸ™„,0
Spotify use to be like you can play your play list and no adds but the update change everything now you can't listen to music what you pick please bring back the old update please ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º,0
"This is the best app for music. I used Gaana before this. Since I switched to spotify, my experience has been pretty good. My playlist has all the songs i listen to and most importantly, my younger brother listens to ""Legends Never Die"" by ""Against the Current"" which Gaana didn't have. I was shocked that spotify had 99.99% songs in the world. But why 4 Starts? Reason is ADS. There are too many adds. After every 3-4 songs, that freaking add about that new song ""Chaand Baliyan"" keeps my mood off.",1
Lyrics shown by Spotify in Punjabi songs are not correct.,0
The app is good but at times it stops playing all of a sudden,0
It's an amazing application and most importantly it show the lyrics which helps to understand the different types of songs songs.,1
Too much ads,0
"One of the best music application I have ever used. But the only matter is with the advertisement, reduce its number so that the listeners can really enjoy your application..",0
This app is really spot on Love how you can listen to any song of your choice Really nice,1
"I'll change my rating back to 5 once they fix the bugs. Love this app! Been using it for 10 years and I really don't want to lose my Playlists, but it's been Hella glitchy lately.",0
Tried the app again after a long time off it and what a change. The lyrics functionality is now present and the app is no longer buggy and slow. I still don't understand why we have to deal with podcasts though. New artist recommendation deserves a bigger spotlight (front and centre). Tour dates and merch is harder to find now. How about artist interviews and SM built in. Listening parties is still a mission. At this point it's just okay and barely competes with the other services. Music first.,0
"The app is stalling after OTP request , i just subscribed to premium and this happened!",0
I think it's a 5 because you can listen to any music you wanted to and you can make up your own playlist of your fav songs,1
its keeps on telling me app doesn't has stopped and doesn't want to play any songs.,0
Don't find updated mix daily. Same playlist came regularly,0
I want comment section in this app ..else everything is perfect and english lyrics to of non-english songs... If this feature comes that would be great.,1
I like this app,1
Spotify sucks compared to literally every one of its competitors.,0
LOVE THE SINGER,1
Ads after every one or two songs. Intuit and senheiser ads. Previously it was 30 mins ad free. Time to switch to other apps,0
Once Spotify learns the music genres and artists you love...you get the best playlists and mixes. It's the best music app I've ever used.,1
"I'm going to be discontinuing this service. They play the same songs over and over again on the artist channels. But more than anything, it's their support for that right-wing podcast person and paying him millions of dollars to spew out hatred and the Trump type of ugliness. I definitely prefer calm radio and it's a much better deal",1
Everything about this app is amazing except for not being able to play the exact song you want to play unless you signed up for something or only have 6 skips per hour but other than that it's an amazing app I recommend itðŸ¦‹ðŸ–¤,1
I love spotifyðŸ˜ And the sound quality is superb hopely for the next update there will be option for high res Audio and dolby atmos support,1
It glitches when my phone screen turns off and won't playðŸ˜ ,0
"This app has remixes from Music Artist that I've been listening to for over a couple of decades now that I didn't even know existed when it came to particular songs, overall, this app is really good.",1
Very good for music lovers . You name it and then play it . Great for chilling out too .,1
"This new update was the worst o! I can't toggle between songs, it's more like the buttons are unresponsive...imagine a song already playing at the middle, if i press the back button the song should start all over. But no, the song keeps playing, the buttons for back and next are unresponsive!!!!!!!!!!! I have to literally swipe to the next song and back again...this update is the worst!!!!! The app wasn't like this before.",0
Excellent app,1
"All controls and views of current track have been missing from the app for days now. There's s a looong thread on this in the forum, with loads of users experiencing the same issue, yet no reaction from the Beast.",0
"I love the music it has rap,jass damn even amine music keep up the good work",1
"Im using spotify for years but ever since the recent update, im not able to play my liked songs. I don't want to shuffle songs and listen. I want to listen to only certain songs which I currently like, and spotify is not allowing to do so. Absolutely devastated by this.",0
"This is one of the best music app i have ever used, I can Listen to lastest album, new music and so much more. If am to recommend any app is SPOTIFY",1
"Great sound quality, easy to make playlists, wear os app is also nice but it requires being connected to phones spotify. Though premium is pretty much required, and some smaller artists I can find on soundcloud/youtube/bandcamp aren't available on spotify, but most of what I listen is available. Trying with a trial of premium atm, considering starting to pay for it mainly because the sound quality is way better than other apps I use. Btw you need to set quality in settings for best quality.",0
Great sounds ðŸ‘Œ on this app. Can listen to all sorts of music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ on it.,1
That bug/crash was terrible. But I love this app and will always prefer it over others.,1
Its best i heard to much songs therse any song you want your favirit rappers like mine xxxtentacion rip. You need to install now if you get out of spotify you can lisent to the song. Give it a good rating.,1
"Great app, though I wish songs for company like Sega could be here.",1
"After a recent phone update the app does not work correctly anymore, and loses some functionality every time I get a text or email. The music will stop playing and then the bar with controls for music disappears as well.",0
Wonderful and awesome,1
"Updating my review to say it's still great. Only issue is large playlists seem to have issues shuffling, sometimes just play the same 60 or so songs.",0
"Honestly it is a nice app but why is it always adding songs to my playlists this ""we added"" is so annoying idc what you added I only want to listen to my songs and not your stupid adds also it just autoplays these added songs althought I turned it off. If this won't go away I'll just switch back to youtube music/youtube because even youtube only have double ads and you have 3 ads in a row.",0
Works perfectly just it hard to navigate my way around the app,0
"Out of all the music apps I have tried , Spotify is the best it has all the songs ur looking for, easy to find and save, it's worth the download.",1
I like Spotify as it has all types of songs to listen according to my mmod and taste.but I believe that the manufacturers should also add offline playlist so songs can be listened offline,0
I love Spotify than gana app,1
Good,1
I hate this app when I try to play a song it literally changes the song,0
100% awesome I love this app more than the Dmusic app. I recommend it to anyone who claims himself a music lover. Just type in your favourite artist and play your favourite song or sing along and groove to the tune. Tadaaah there you try it now.,1
The app is spotty. As in the app works perfectly some days and other weeks it will not function properly. Literally not able to pause anything unless you close the app.,0
Updating again Even more unhappy with this app! It's been months now since it stopped working properly. It won't recognise my chromecast anymore! It can hardly connect to my car radio! Constantly closes itself even though when I WANT to exit the app it won't close in the background AT ALL unless I force stop the app. Honestly can't believe I'm paying premium for this many bugs??,0
"Keeps asking me to ""join a group session"" of strangers. It's insufferable, distracting, and incessant. There is apparently no solution to this and no way to decativate the annoying and unnecessary ""feature""",0
Don't give tooo much ads,0
Great options for all platforms of music,1
"At first, the app was fine, but now, 1. I search for a song, get it but I can't play it. I can only play it's preview... This is annoying ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜  2. I created a playlist, I don't know who told you to add for me songs.. ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”",0
"Songs from my Liked list keep getting removed, and i dont know why. It says i have 500+ liked songs, but im begining to wonder how many of those are songs that arent on spotify anymore (yet still show up on the playlist) or are songs ive added the same version of multiple times. Its a problem when im suppose to have that many songs, but Without Me still seems to play on Shuffle almost every day i use it. I just started paying so i could listen to my music offline, yet i have my stuff removed?",0
"Woke censorship is never the way forward. Whatever your political persuasion, censoring drives conversation underground. Without open and sensible discourse nothing will ever be solved. Uninstalling app and withdrawing any support for Spotify.",0
Hey Spotify no means no! Stop playing songs I thumbed down. It won't stop playing stuff that I say I don't like. And it keeps forcing r&b on me even though I don't like r&b. It only seems to play top 100 but I can't get it to play anything I haven't heard too many times. Will not pick a genre no matter what genre I choose it just mixes all popular genres together It is not worth paying for It is worth paying to avoid because it will not play what you pay for. It's going to force top 100 on you.,0
Seriously has hands down THEE best music app known to date! Premiem is the way!,1
"Usually have no issue, love the app. Since latest update there are tonnes of glitches/bugs. Playing bar is not visible on app, doesn't read online when online.",0
"So many ad disturbances kindly without premium, suggestion take the all problem seriously..thanks..",1
The media player outside of the app and the progress bar inside the app disappear way to frequently. I have to hard quit the app multiple times to resolve the issue.,0
My favourite player. Easy to access data from any device. Easily maintained playlists and liked song. And of course premium has greater features. Love this player.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘Œ,1
Shows/podcasts that I dont even listen to keep on bugging me and cant remove them. Just add a remove button on things we don't like/want already. Or better yet let users cutomize what we wanna see and hide/remove what we dont.,0
Premium a bit overpriced & the mobile app doesn't always open correctly.,0
Too many and too long ads for the free version,0
"Over the years I have used so many apps for music but when Spotify came to India in 2018, it changed my music experience to next level exponentially amazing. I love the app and it's unique feature like Spotify connect",1
"This app is just incredible. I miss this appðŸ˜”ðŸ’š (lol i can just use it on my pcðŸ˜‚) but one thing is that.. Even tho i uninstalled it (on my phone) cuz of storage problems, i want to give suggestions cuz. Um, i hope it would never go back to that playlist (the ones i created) where when i touch one of the songs, it'll just play a preview and not the whole song. But overall amazing app! Pretty sure kpop stans have this app but for those who haven't, u can use ur laptopðŸ˜‰ although it'll have adsðŸ¤§",1
"Album art is frequently missing from areas in the UI, especially the minimized control bar. Also starts playing automatically when connected to Bluetooth even if it was not open or is not the selected input on the device. A setting to disable auto play on Bluetooth connect would be helpful.",0
"constantly playing ""suggested"" songs instead of the song you select. years and still no fix, completely unusable",0
I love this app but only problem is so many ads other than it was good app,0
"The music content is really rich.but for free version it lacks some options like choosing the desired track instead of mandatory shuffle play, in addition to the moving back to the previous track. I hope you consider that.",0
"The music will play, but the play controls aren't active. It will just stop playing, even though it shows it should be playing. Completely unusable since the last update",0
"Free version sucks. Make me listen to ads, not LIMIT THE NUMBER OF SONGS I CAN SKIP. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?",0
The lyrics doesn't show up tho I have changed my phone. Please help me I've tried all the methods on internet but they don't help anything,0
"Spotify please fix the app! Your most important features don't work. Can't select songs, wrong songs are playing and songs stop to play!",0
Enjoyable music lots to choose from give 5 star rating fabulous,1
"Recommend new and old songs daily so that people can vibe. Your company is only running because of the API and podcasts. But Spotify as a music app still needs a push ... Speaking facts ""Resso"" Is better as Music app",0
Spotify is great you can listen to all kinds of music and even make your own playlist enjoy everything from the oldies till now don't take my word for it get Spotify today enjoy everything you like to hear in the way of music,1
Uninstalling this irritating app for constantly giving ads every 2 mins..what is your purpose? We dont want to buy Premium then why does your ads constantly push us to buy it? Do you realise you really pressurise ppl into buying premium? gonna rate this 1 star because to be honest wink app is better,0
Bugs since last update: stops randomly. Doesn't show in pull down menu from phone that it's even running nor does it have a key on the lockscreen that it's running Have to completely close tab/app to change songs/pause/resume/skip etc.,0
Its very good vibe   ,1
Best music app ever!!! Great audio quality even without hifi. I wish there was Dolby Atmos support though.,1
The interface feels quite non-intuitive,0
I love this app as it regularly updates me with new music every time ðŸ’ªðŸ½ðŸ˜…ðŸ’¯,1
"The app keeps crashing, songs disappear, had to make new accounts cause it wouldn't let me sign in even if I changed the password and now it just won't open. I'm done, peace out!",0
Wonderful application which helps in relaxing our tiredness,1
"A very wide range of hip hop songs and that's it, not one other genre of music",1
Third class app,1
Love the availability of music and the selection,1
"The app is good and all but why does it keep shutting down when I leave the app. It happens every 2 minutes and the song starts playing from the first. Is there a way to solve this. I have tried logging out of all devices, reinstalling the app, clearing cache. Is there anything else I can do. It is getting annoying at this point. Thanks in advance",0
It was quiet good . And also lyrics is available that help me to understand how to pronounce according to the songs ... I like it.....,1
Lots of music wich I love but spotify needs to pay their music artists more money.,0
ðŸ˜Love this App ðŸ¥° Been using Spotify for years and I will never change ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜ Also PLEASE CHECK out My Son's Remix SONGS He has 2 songs out NOW Unseen Forces and Bing Bong Remix ðŸ’ƒðŸ½ðŸ•ºðŸ¾ðŸŽ› ðŸŽ¶ plus Lots more to come ðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ§ Check them out onðŸ˜€ SPOTIFY ðŸ˜ƒ and Make sure you HIT âž¡ FOLLOW â¬… PLEASE ðŸ˜THK YOU ðŸ˜‡ Enjoy the Music He goes byðŸ˜Ž â†ª DOCTOR Z â†©,1
"to he honest, I really hate the new update now! I cannot skip songs I cannot play the songs at the parts I like to- what's all this? Not everyone can't afford to get premium why do have to do like that?",1
"I've been a happy Spotify user for years, but deciding to ""depreciate"" the service for my $500 Kenwood car stereo that I purchased specifically for Spotify integration was a low blow. Thanks for disregarding long time customers just to force people to buy the new Spotify Car Thing. Ya'll should be ashamed.",0
"Worst experience, automatic advertisements play suddenly even if you you are not playing any song, merely installed went to office and it plays advertisements automatically. Doesnt even show the playing advertisement in apps runing section. Really worst app... Recommend everyone to uninstall.",0
I like this app for song's...i love it...ðŸ¥°,1
"It's excellent ,less data consumer",1
"After the last update, I am wondering where the hack is player going every time ... It disappears with no reason, I cannot control the songs I want to play, no option to repeat..disaster! From a regular user who uses it more than 5 hours a day, I am starting looking for alternatives..",0
Spotify needs to improve a lot of bugs for Android users. Constant listening to songs you didn't even select. Cannot repeat a song when ever you want. Etc.,0
Good app for song,1
"Tooo many commercials, yes I understand see rstand your funds are into it, I am enjoying it all continue !!",1
very cool but i hate the ads-,0
A personal goofball that feeds you the right track at the right time.,1
10/10. Would recommend!! Plays great music!!,1
Excellent App ,1
I can't skip music's? can't choose music of my choice ? damn you go too far just for not subscribing,1
Relentless Bluetooth popup.,0
playback keeps stopping continually. tried restarting the phone and uninstall app. keeps happening.,0
Really enjoyed the free trial. Got my son to uograde his account to a premium family account,1
New record of five ads in a after 1 song!! It's getting ridiculous. At this rate you might as well just get Amazon Prime Music it's cheaper and does the exact same thing without any ads.,0
the new update sucks. 1. at first it didn't let me listen to a song i was already listening to when i went away from the app for a second. 2. then it's stopped giving me the opportunity to listen to songs i want to add to my playlist and now i can't find new music to listen to because i can't listen to the song and decided if i want to ad this to the playlist or not! 3. now it's not letting me getting into the app! it's shows a black screen. as someone who has spotify premium it's disgusting.,0
This app sucks. I just want to listen to my music even with the ads. I dont want to listen to beiber.,0
App has soo many bugs it's sometimes unusable,0
The app is not working,0
"I don't have premium and when I started using spotify years back the ads were fine. Now it just too much. Firstly, at some point if you decided to skip the ""watch ads for 30 mins add free"", you were showed ads regardless. And you didn't get 30 mins add free afterwards? No comment... The past few weeks I am listening to approximately 1 min of ads for 4 mins of music time. That is just too much. Now - out of principle - I will uninstall the app instead of switching to premium.",0
Very nice superb the music app is great.,1
"I love using Spotify but for some reason the mobile Spotify update absolutely sucks, you can't pick your song. You can only shuffle play and then sometimes it will play songs not even in the playlist. Please fix it to how it was before, like how it is on the browser.",0
It is very great with music but if there will be downloading option in the app who are not premium then it would be ðŸ‘ðŸ»,1
App crashed when going horizontal while watching a podcast.,0
"Premium feature So I've been a Spotify user for a while now, maybe 2 or 3 years now, and decided to use premium. Highlighting the pros and cons I've come across using Spotify Premium. Pros: unlimited skips, ad free, and shuffle feature. Cons: Spotify will shuffle the music order instead in the order you choose (not sure if that's a bug), songs will randomly start playing from other playlists and the music will suddenly stop playing for no reason. So hopefully these cons get fixed.",0
"it's very good this app i love it, i love to listen my favorites music + with spotify i found so many new style of music and i like that, but i can't play some songs on my phone and that's sucks :(",1
It's really a good app I love it coz it doesn't contain alots of ads,1
Very good Excellent with no gliches,1
Keeps shutting off in the middle of listening. Sometimes can't shut it off when I press the pause button. No way to turn off the app/ exit listening button.,0
The thing is this is spotify lite not normal spotify and I wasn't having any problems with normal spotify.,0
Crashes whenever I try to add music to my playlist,0
"I am still loving my Spotify. I like being able to listen to the songs, old and new, that I want to hear, when and where I want to hear them. I upgraded to the paid subscription and have no regrets, just lots of music, my kind of music.",1
"My overall experience in this app has been alright. There are some bugs in the new update like missing controls and all, but that's not the big issue. The problem is, I'm unable to see the lyrics of any song in my phone (realme 8 updated to Android 12). But I can see it in my PC. Please give me a solution to fix this issue asap.",0
"Great interface, great sound quality. Just signed up because I heard you guys defended Joe Rogan.",1
So many problems on this app.Please remove the problems..,0
"I love using Spotify but I keep going back to Amazon Music Unlimited, as I'm on the road a lot and the hands-free feature through Alexa helps keep me safe. Have you ever considered commissioning a hands-free assistant for Spotify, or running it through the Google assistant somehow?",1
Good but to much ads,1
Was there recently an update? Why can't I see the song that's playing? Why is it when I click on a song it doesn't show that's the one that's playing? PLEASE FIX THIS !!,0
Easy to use and still free,1
"One word describes spotify, AWESOME!",1
Well its good but so far I had trouble with. Its doesnt want to open the albums I created on my library,0
Love the app but I wish when you run out of skips you can get another by watching an ad.,0
I am a Old Spotify user and According to my experience it is a very awesome amazing and mind blowing app because it has many points to become Helping such like very easy UI and outstanding music audio and podcasts quality Equalizer according to our mood given playlist And it havent any more problem but I recommend to improve their premium membership something low because it demands gone low somewhere for that point  THANX,1
"You get 1 star so I can tell people if your not paying for premium they forcefully make you watch ads after every single song picked , this app is a waste of time, since they've changed it!",0
"Full of ads, a lot of times I get up to 5 30-second ads successively It's really annoying",0
i absolutely love this app...you get all kinds of songs your into and very affordable prices for they're premium packages....keep up the good work spotify,1
It's a good app to listen to music and very easy to use.,1
Sensational,1
"I have tested out multiple different platforms, and the two best ones are ytmusic and this one. Music selection is amazing and the app interface is awesome.",1
Great,1
"Why arnt you uploading Tom McDonald's newest song, very sus spotify",0
Gave up trying to get it to stop playing music every time I use my airpods on Android. I had to remove it.,0
"Content is okay but my music pauses constantly when app is playing in background. This just recently started happening and I have tried all of the ""fixes"" suggested by spotify. Very annoyed to be paying for premium and having an app that glitches all the time.",0
"Spotify has gotten extremely buggy in the last year or so. I will sometimes get redirected to a playlist radio when I try to shuffle play a playlist, and once in a while it pauses what I'm listening to and the now playing bar in the app and the control widget on my notification screen disappear. I've been a premium member for years and hope these problems get fixed soon, but it looks like they've been known issues for a while.",0
Constant problems but when there aren't any problems it works great. I would like to suggest to have a button that sorts the playlists by genre,0
Some music it won't let me play when I added it to my favorites and skips to the next song but for ty most part I've had a good experience using Spotify.,1
I really enjoy the app close to a 5-star rating Thank you I like how the app opens most of my Shazams I held off on the 5th star as the app uses a lot of my SD cards memory Might the free with ads version take up less space I previously stopped using Spotify when I realized the gigabytes it consumed,1
I love Spotify Forever,1
Can you guys make editing playlist by moving the songs in order that we want instead of just changing the name.,0
"Limited skips, 4-8 ads every ad break, stuck on shuffle, always yelling at me to get premium but doesn't let me buy it because I'm in quÃ©bec, and made my music 5 times quieter. But other then that it's great",1
"I've had spotify for a while and upgraded to premium last year, it worked great. But currently songs will randomly stop playing half way through for no reason. I then have to go back into the app or close it completely and re open it and shuffle the song again just to start it at the beginning due to this. It's getting extremely annoying because it is starting to stop every half an hour or so. Please fix it so I can love spotify again.",0
"Very enjoyable & commendable. Always clear, no network issues experienced. Thanks",1
"Interface is not the best! Lots of propaganda and you have a song in mind and doesn't play it... Plays others ""like it"" also promotes the ability to have podcasts that are very hateful and harmful for the common mind... Allowing misinformation to spread like wild fire. No longer going to support this.",0
I dont know why there is no option to select song language in this app on Android 12,0
The whole thing which you have to pay for premium and not get advertising is great but for one problem. Everytime you want to listen to a podcast you get advertising please fix this problem The music you get no advertising with premium,0
"I use this constantly, it's pretty good. my only issue is why in the hell is the ""add to playlist"" and ""hide song from Playlist"" right next to each other? Please fix this.",0
"It's an ok app, although constantly having to redownload music just so you can listen to it offline when you paid for premium is very annoying. EDIT- The latest update has made Spotify fall far, even with premium, you can't use basic controls like play, pause, skip from the lock screen, only when you unlock the phone Still having to redownload music after week or 2 if you want to listen to it offline very annoying.",1
Despite the fact that iam free plan Spotify still gives me quite wat I need and in the near future imma get premium and enjoy it . All in all great app,1
"Great, could do with more audio books",0
"Premium is like heaven, but they literally like torture you if you use free. Unwanted songs, and limited skips to force you to listen to garbage and long ads. I could list many others but I would give 5 to the premium version: decent price but costs something and a 1 star to free",0
Often does not work properly. As a subscriber I demand more,0
"All is well with the exception of a the app connecting to my car without me opening it. Very annoying. Otherwise, no other complaints.",1
I always hear ads more than the actual songs,0
Too much of ads Really fed-up Getting 4 ads in one go,0
Pls don't download it at the start it gives less ads but after few months it gives ads after each 10 min .ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ and they have siezed my account now I don't know why but I cannot login into my account and this real pain.,0
Since the latest update it no longer works properly. Everytime I get in the car and connected via Bluetooth it will either not play at all or play random music but not show in Spotify. Which is annoying considering we can't touch our phones while driving. Also glitches with Google maps. What ever changes were made... please revert them,0
Slight changes made in the interface graphics made it worse. Was way better and classy before.,0
Used to like it but now you have to pay for basic fetures. You are forced to listen to random songs even if your trying to listen to one song. Its annoying.,0
"It would be incredible if you guys could figure out a better layout for the 'now playing' song part for tablets. (You know, the one with the lyrics and play/pause buttons.) Something like putting the lyrics on one side of the screen and the play/pause buttons on the other side. Left and right. Guys, it would be nice if we had the ability to check the 'date of release' of songs.",0
Great service.! Worth every penny!!,1
Superb so useful but I can't change the lanuguage of lyrics by mistake I changed it and I can't change it back and I just pressed the offline mode and it's showing some problem,0
Too many ads.,0
"I like Spotify a lot, but it started adding songs to my Playlist that I dont know, like, or want on my Playlist. I tried hiding all of them but it gave me more of them. U also can't remove them. The reason I found this is b/c I was playing through my Playlist and a song I dont like started playing. I went to look on my phone and it had added a ton of random things. Please don't tell me to undo the enhance, b/c I dont have an enhance button anymore.i had one last night and did not press it.",0
"This app isnt worth it anymore, the most basic things for a music streaming service is stuck behind a damn pay wall, cant even choose your own music without paying and thats the most basic thing you should be able to do regardless, this is just a big money grab and theres tons of apps better then spotify now, even youtube music and thats something",0
Wish they don't get rid of the dislike button but still like the app as a whole.,1
"Absolutely love it. This app provides amazing music (and nostalgic parodies), sure the ads in lite are annoying a bit, but premium membership is AMAZING and reasonably priced for add free listening. Would enjoy if you could .mp3 download your playlists tho. 4 stars!!!",1
"Spotify can't provide me with Playlist composed of the various genres of music I love. It will provide classical, classic rock, and current hits all at once instead of one Playlist per genre. Very frustrating. Further, it plays the same songs over and over no matter how many times I skip them.",0
Love the app BUT the notifications update is less manageable and an eye sore. Less was more. One star until it gets fixed/changed back.,0
"I like the app but, since im not a paying user on mobile i dont get to choose to play my own song, other than that i find the app pretty good, though i did wish that specific premium feature could come on free, id understand if its not possible, just writing this as a warning for mobile users downloading this who dont wanna pay for premium, i do listen on my ipad and it works amazingly there so im happy about that, thank you",1
"I love how easy it is to make playlists,save songs, and share. So much music and not enough time. I can listen to Korean R&B, US Pop, and African top artists all in the same place all on my own playlist. This as been a wonderful music experience. My musical horizans have been broadened by the wide and accessible selection.",1
Sound is really unbelievable,0
Great app lots of music,1
Its good,1
"Keeps constantly shutting off or continuously playing and the buttons freeze for play, pause and loses ff and rewinding options. Got a Samsung S21, that's even the problems began. FIX THE BUG! This used to be 5 stars.",0
Hi ive been trying to connect and stream music but i couldn't connect Fix internet connection error then we can talk about other problems,0
Whole app went to trash. Play button disappears. Music skips. Not sure why I'm paying for this.,0
It's fine but I might as well use a different music app since you get limited skips (which is ridiculous) You can't even pick which song you want to play.. ðŸ˜’ðŸ™,0
One thing I HATE on my phone is notifications. The second. Notifications that don't go away or show up whenever they want. Seeing as I use my phone for my music source 3% of the time there is no reason that Spotify should harass me and clog up my notifications when the app is closed in the background. Uninstalled it to make it stop.,0
The songs on playlist dont bring a list of songs,0
I love the high quality sound,1
Really osam I like it I experianced and enjoy to explore the song,1
I love having Spotify but this last update has kinda ruined the app for me. Completely unable to connect to my Alexa device which is one of these main ways I listen to Spotify.,0
Super,1
When I click play it turns on everything except the songs in my playlist. I absolutely hope any one partaking in the creation of shitify get cancer in every organ of there body I have wased hours of my life in this utter disappointment I hope everyone can agree if not ya got brain damage. Oh and this is not the #1 muisc app at all!,0
It's a good app but there are few things bad with it it has a 6 hour wait to it when u skip like 4. Or 3 songs #2 it skips randomly for no reason #3 u can pick ur own song u just have to hope it's the first one Here is a good thing u can actually change the song without it being random in daily mixes,0
"Beautiful, thoughtful consideration in selection, I'm having an awesome experience good for my soul and spirit. Thanks. I rated you 4 because I believe there's always room for improvement.",1
App can be laggy sometimes. The search feature is not smart enough to predict what you're looking for. Most times you have to type in exactly what you're looking for.,0
Yes I am satisfied with Spotify but at a certain time the ads will become so annoying (not in premium) except that it's a wonderful music app,0
Mind blowing app my all favouite song available in this app,1
Cool; have a problem shuffling but it's mot bad,0
"""Weâ€™re always making changes and improvements to Spotify."" Please don't. You destroy an already functional app by adding additional bugs every single time! I'm considering switching to apple music because your app is always troublesome. I've been using Spotify for about 8 years now.",0
too many of the same ads with free version,0
"After a year and something, I consider this app being simple trash! Extremely expensive, ""song station"" jumps from techno to hip hop like is full ret@rd and overall you have better alternatives for free or through work arounds. I am quitting the subscription soon because of the insane price and useless song suggestion. SoundCloud is 2 times better.",0
"Very annoyed that I keep on being redirected to a certain podcast, which is produced by Spotify too. So it's as if I am still bombarded with ads, when I paid to have the ads removed. If it's a bug, fix it. It's been weeks.",0
"Premium user. Every update the bugs get worse and worse. I know bugs are bound to happen but now the app crashes constantly. The sleep timer on podcasts is broken and will not aways work. As in I have set the sleep timer set and I wake up with a podcast playing. It's an amazing app when it works well but I can't go a day after this update without a frustrating bug. The last updates yielded bugs once a week, what did you guys do with the last update that makes the app terrible?",0
"Can't download single song ,i have to download whole playlist only.",0
Great music App for all of my listening wants an needs Tongall.,1
Usually great but there have been gitches lately. Cant always pause in the pull down menu and dosnt stop playing when i open netflix and youtube anymore,0
Gives great music at touch of a button,1
"I was fine with the app for the past 5 years. Recently the app start to crush all the time. Cant even open it. Tried to update the system and the app to the latest version, clear cashe and storage. None of these worked.",0
Love using this app!! I have never had any trouble with it.,1
"Each update makes Spotify unusable. It's becoming much slower for things to load on the app, even if you've downloaded your songs. Too many functions such as lyrics or videos playing are making things slow, there should be an option to switch it off during offline view.",0
"Get ads WAY to much, I got 7 ads in a row before I could listen to 1 song.",0
spotify is hands down the best streaming service yes i said it better than anything including netflix hulu disney plus stuff like that spotify premium is the best thing i have evr spent my money on thank you spotify,1
"I can't even listen songs I want, It keep playing on different songs I didn't even add on my playlist, also the autoplay in setting doesn't even work",0
UPDATE: deletes music/podcasts that you've downloaded at random times. Crashing non stop. Everytime I try to play a podcast the app crashes.,0
"This app was good, but now it's like not working, we ha e loadshedding, so that means network ain't so good. But the app is loading forever... I can't even switch the app to offline mode, it's like the app depends on network, but it's on my phone.... ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ I'm paying for something that's not working when my network is down... Wow.. Slow internet, slow Spotify..",0
I like this app because it can play song if you have low connection. It recommend nice songs.,1
Good music  app,1
Unable to login to the app after installing worst app ever,0
Too many problems to list. I'll stick with yutubemusic,0
I was listening to one musician and the app started playing other music and I couldn't change it or pass. Not impressed.,0
Used to love this app to recently. Now I can't play Playlist or artist I look up. Acting up lately,1
Great tunes that are easy to load to your device.,1
Great audio quality...,1
There is a bug in the app where the playback bar always disappears and I don't know which song is playing. You need to restart the application to recover!!!,0
"Spotify good. Make many music beats for enjoyment of ears, add a feature to permanently block Justin Bieber and it's a five star app.",1
"I love the huge selection of different genres at my fingertips. I am loving how it creates Playlist for me, always discovering new songs and artists. I love how reliable the app plays for hours and hours with no glitches on my Samsung Galaxy s10e...*upgraded* same on my Samsung Galaxy S21 5G ULTRA ...still loving SPOTIFY!!!...",1
Perfect and the best singing apps of all time..,1
"Great app, especially on PC because there's less ads. On Mobile it's not bad either, the 30-Minute Ad-Free Video that you get certainly makes it better and more bearable. Hopefully in the future once I get a steady job I will get myself that sweet, juicy premium that I've been wanting to get.",1
"It's a good app but there are a lot of ads. It is close to the level of radio commercials and the videos for 30 minutes of ad free music are few and far between. If this was improved, I would enjoy this app more than I do now.",0
"Everytime I wak up the up I uninstalled and it gets annoying,like REALLY annoying",0
"Too many adds for every 5 or 6 songs Too much aads,kill the intrest on songs",0
Lot of ads ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”â˜¹â˜¹,0
Great music app. The best.,1
"Lately I have to force close and restart the app 3-6 time before it actually works. Not worth paying premium for this. Android version 10. Uninstaller and reinstalled twice with no change. Update 2 23 2022, issue is unchanged",0
The music is really good and a great variety music from the twenties & thirties to the present. Yes some music recordings have been cut back but stills puts out a great volune varieties that makes spotify a very addictingand lovableby all means.,1
"Best music app but it has flaws, im on android and if i plug in my headphones spotify automatically starts playing without me goig into the app. Another flaw is that its gonna play ads every 30 mins but its more like every 10 minutes. Great app overall tho",0
"I wasn't sure at first , but i wouldn't be without it now. Opened a door to a shedload of tracks i would never have heard, both old and new.",1
Always enjoyed this app. Every type of experience and type of music you need.,1
There is so much music to choose from and a wide range of genres,1
I like it,1
It won't allow me to skip songs and it regularly replaces my most viewed content with lesser viewed content.,1
"The app randomly starts playing music, even when it's not open. Additionally you have to click through 5 pages of confirmation to cancel a subscription, which I find to be excessive.",0
It is a very nice appit will not even be a problem for the user who is using it for studies,1
please change the plus button back to heart,1
Like how it will put music together for you based on what you have listened to,1
I love sitting around with friends and we make new playlist when together.,1
Suddenly spotify skips when in lock screen. Updated and magically doesn't work. Not internet connection nor bluetooth. Seriously frustrating.,0
Update: there was an update release that resolved the issue. I've corrected my rating to better reflect my current satisfaction with this app. Original Rating: I've had a family premium plan for years but the recent update has too many issues and makes me want to reconsider my music streaming service.,0
"Spotify rocks it, got kicked off YouTube for expressing my first amendment rights of free speech and don't miss communist Marxist YouTube at all, thanks Spotify!!!!",1
"Functional app, but little is done about the spread of dangerous misinformation on the platform.",0
Best with ads,1
"Useless. App keeps freezing, doesn't resume podcast from last played. You'd assume with all the cash these guys make that these simple issues wouldn't be happening",0
I try to listen to a song but it puts a different one,1
LIKE IT,1
"Crashed many times when I try to play songs. Uninstalled for now. But good app to play songs, lyrics also there. Sound quality is also good.",1
It has all the features that a music streaming app needs. There are podcasts too. I just love this app. I am going to recommend it to everyone who want to listen songs and podcasts.,1
Amazing none stop music,1
Bug after bug.,0
It would be good if you could include accoutic and live concert versions more,0
"I'm having so many problems with my Spotify, it's driving me nuts. I've spent way too much time troubleshooting and it still jumps to the next song randomly, stops after a few seconds of playing when it's through my Google Home or Android Auto, tells me it's offline when it's not...I'm close to abandoning it altogether.",0
It's music cant go wrong. I love it but you'll always have people that want more for free ? They are what you call karens,1
Logs you out while it's set to offline. Can't log in while it's set to offline. Had to clear the data and thereby delete all my downloaded music.,0
I'd say it's good I don't know why there's so many bad reviews but there is just 1 thing that's annoys me it's the ads but as long as I can still listen to music I'm fine :),1
Dear Spotify why do I get songs that I didn't put on my playlist??? And why do we have shuffle play?,0
awesome ðŸ‘I love that I have daily mix songs for my taste.,1
App is fine. Not as polished as iOS version. I wish we could see more than just top ten songs. Also so annoying when browsing discography so include all single releases. Just show me the legit album.,0
It's a best app for listening music,1
"Very nice app, and sound quality is also nice and but to many ads if u don't have premium",1
I used to love this app. Not sure what happened but it has seriously gone down hill. Needs a update to fix all the current issues.,0
Could use an explanation why I need service to listen to things I have downloaded...ya know....because that's why people download them????,0
"Now playingâ€ bar disappears. I force stop, clear cache, and it returns for a while and then disappears again, intermittent connection with Chromecast, Samsung S22U-TMobile",0
Very clunky and borderline unusable at times on Android. I've used spotify since it started and recently this year the app has almost become unusable. If I play a podcast it is not recognized on the mini player in the app itself. This cause a lot of issues. It will not let me pause or skip because any Bluetooth devices are not recognizing what I'm playing. The podcast will come to a complete stop and since the mini player hasn't recognized what I'm playing I have to manually search it in the app,0
"After new update spotify only told us to buy premium , so much ads ðŸ˜¡",0
It's been extremely buggy ever since the servers went down a while back I'm having a hard time with music just stopping for no reason,0
Was going great until the app started glitching and would only play songs on shuffle mode (can't turn it off) and I can't play songs from 1 album (it plays all songs from the artist from multiple albums or even songs they featured on),0
"Use to be my go to app, and I was a long time premium user. However over the past 2 years they've clearly been unable to handle technical issues, with some users completely unable to use the service for weeks or months at a time. They sooner or later fixed it, but never publicly announced the issue and swept it under the rug. I was one of those users. And now, I've been unable to download songs again for a while now. I'm not paying 10 dollars monthly for no ads,and I'm tired of the bad service.",0
I love and like Spotify because I like to hear and listen to the music,1
"So nice for playing songs you actually want to listen to <3 Difficult to play when trying to play spedific songs on a mobile device, however it works fine with specific songs on my computer.",1
U know,1
"Limit the adds, personally I highly dislike that when I shuffle through my liked songs it adds more song that I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in and doesn't even cooperate with the same taste as mine. All of the suggestions are from the most popular ones. Note: I'm so sick of having Adel pop up, I hate her music and you keep recommending her. Please stop.",0
I don't want to give money just to listen to a specific song,1
"Would rate better if I could choose the songs I'd actually want to listen to, the Xbox/Tablet/Web client are all far better than this junk.",0
"App is trash, can't listen. To music without your dumb app play other music I don't want to listen to",0
Easy to use app. Great to listen to the music you like.,1
Best music app i dont have any other words to say about this,1
Whenever a podcast is removed it will for some reason tell you that you don't have wifi no matter how strong your connection is. And why the heck you have to wait 1 hour every 15 second skip? And you can't even pick the song you acually want when you search up the exact song and artist. I don't recommend this app in my opinion.,0
Thanks Spotify ,1
Can't play any songs it always says you're offline even when I have high speed wifi and network it is become a worst music app available in play Store,0
"This new update is changing inside the Spotify, everytime I play my liked song, it only play for 10 second only, unlike the old Spotify, everytime I tap my Like song, it always play the full. I want the old Spotify, this new Spotify is bad.",0
This app is a better then any other music app.ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾,0
This app doesn't let your critique anything; whether it be like racist or single minded podcasts like behind the bastards or necronomipod. I find it quite humorous that such a large business could be so reckless when so many of their podcast creators destroy lives without little to any evidence.,0
"The service of Spotify is absolutely wonderful, but the mobile app is pretty horrible. Will load forever, crash randomly, and freak out for no reason. Its been years and these issues still remain. I still use Spotify, but it's much better on PC than mobile.",0
I like it it relives stress and my depression ðŸ˜€,1
"Spotify premium is great! Especially the deal where you can get 3 months free, thats pretty cool. The only downside is the non-premium ( i guess thats how youd say that?? Lol) spotify where you can only listen in shuffle, have limited skips, and there's a bunch of ads. But overall i love spotify :)",1
Sound is good Like the personal playlist option,1
I find the function of playing an entirely different song when I click on a song completely annoying and useless and honestly this app isn't that good and is just here to get money YouTube has less ads,0
I am a chauffeur and I always ask my passengers what they want to hear and they enjoy it and I enjoy seeing them happy.,1
Too many ads,0
"I have been using Spotify for 2years but the problem is that i am not able to play some songs. These are songs which i frequently hearing. So i make another Spotify using another phone number. Then also I am not able to hear that. Don't know whether those can only be hear by apple users. Please fix this issue. Aayat, laal ishq, are the songs which I can't play in Spotify.",0
Can no longer play through my smart speakers ? It was simple task to connect to them now I'm not so sure about all these upgrades it might be secure for the company but the consumer is no longer the priority.,0
Not sure what the issue is but can't pause or stop a podcast or tune at the moment. It's playing but only has the play button to press so I'm having to either uninstall the app or restart my phone to stop it! Started happening a few days ago. Thought an update and reinstall would work but hasn't fixed the issue. It also spa playing for absolutely no reason. No way of contacting Spotify of course,0
After every single song it plays add n they r heavily annoying even after update they haven't realized its annoying to keep such thing they removed the feature 30min ad free after a video add better to see other option,0
Really disappointing as I often use the browser app. Can't play a single song without it being in a shuffled play list. Can't listen to an album in order either. It's actually amazing how badly it's designed. I'm just going to use sound cloud and YouTube from now on.,0
"this app is a nightmare. constantly have to close and clear cache to use it. if you pause a podcast at all, when you go back, the whole thing stalls and freezes and you have to go back to square one, close, delete cache, reopen and try again. worst app i use at the moment and only for joe rogan i'd never go near it",0
"Absolutely terrible on mobile. I can never use the mobile version because of how stupidly unbearable it is. How come PC version has unlimited skips AND can play any song in the playlist and mobile can't? And why can't i just make a playlist without other reccommended songs being randomly added and i can't get rid of them? Literally the worst music app, i swear. I can't even play just ONE single song wothout having to play a whole playlist just to get to it. I dont know how people can use this.",0
"3rd class app, Please don't install. I played many songs but it automatic play some another after some time. I assumed this app will provide some batter optios to compare Ganna.",0
Just love Spotify.,1
"Unacceptable for a paid service that is this old to have this many bugs. The now playing bar, which controls everything, has been MIA for months. Music just randomly stops playing. The buttons to pause and play just randomly stop working. The only remediation is to force stop and clear the cache. Trying to get support from Spotify is an exercise in madness. Their forums are an absolute mess and their support teams understand the application less than a casual user.",0
The app is better now. I'm no longer having card issues. I only have a problem withthe app automatically starting up when I connect a Bluetooth device,0
Hiding podcast removes it from home screen only for 90 days! That should be permanent,0
Add se,1
I can't log in I'm paying for premium service. I Uninstalled the app and now I can't re install it. What is going on? No music in my car or anywhere. Canceling my contract and going back to Pandora.,0
"I'm a BTS army.. I like k-pop and pop usually I selected BTS, Blackpink etc :-.. It's relaxing and so.. Coll.. I like this app very and i shared about this app to my frnd she also installed thanks.. For this beautiful app..ðŸ˜œâœ¨ï¸ðŸ˜ðŸ˜˜",1
I like it and I rate it 3 out 5 but i am not able to pay for premium and i dont know what seems to be the problem can i get a solution to it asap ?,0
It's really good I've got premium but I need to use the genre feature in the liked songs. My genre sorting feature does not work for Android Google Pixel and I would like it to be fixed please and thank you thanks,0
"Every new update seems to make this app worse. It stops playing randomly, notifications for new podcasts won't let me actually play the episode. Every month I get closer to cancelling my subscription.",0
"It works great until they have a big update. I had to re-download it including all my playlist which was annoying but after I re-download it, it's working great again",1
I love to see my hard earned money put into improvements and new things like lyrics. Would like to get mistakes from artist as well.,0
"Love this app! I noticed a lot of free loaders complaining about the app and its limitations etc. for users who don't pay for the app. To be honest, you expect the developers to give you a free ride over their hardwork? They too have bills and royalty to pay. If you are not willing to pay a person for their work, then its best to just keep quiet. For me, a customer who does pay for the app, I'm very happy with it.",1
"since the last update (4.5.22) i have the issue, that when i play my favorite songs, that the app sometimes enters into a song radio without me even deciding. hope the issue gets fixed asap. the ""recent recomendations"" of the app are just random playlists, not reflecting my actual recent music. as i dont listen to podcast, it's annoying that they always get recommended, even in languages i don't listen to.",0
It's great for my liked songs I love to listen too. But autoplay songs are so annoying! None of my songs whould play but autoplay will play instead.,0
"no pause button. ever since the update on the 13th, my phone hasnt let me pause/ see what music im actually listening to. im not even able to pause the music without just completely restarting the app.",0
I hate the adds and the skipping 6 times for an hour,0
Terrible experience. It's a $9.99 a month service and all I've heard so far is ads. Trash! Get it together. Why am I paying for commercials? That's miles away from being premium listening experience.,0
When im offline your song wont play I'm a subscriber and downloaded the song to my playlist Please fix this issue thank you,1
"Best streaming service on both Android and iOS, I enjoy the Premium since it offers you the ability to play music uninterrupted by Ads and the playlists are simply amazing.",1
For some reason I can't listen to my Spotify on any of my Bluetooth devices. Really upset with this!!!! Don't know that I will continue with this app.,0
I'm currently unhappy with Spotify I have music that I have brought into my local files & the songs show on my playlist but does not play on my mobile. I have already uninstalled & reinstalled the app ...nothing. :[,0
Good place for music but a ton of ads.,0
Since 2023,1
"Very few commercials. Unlike YouTube, you can actually listen to your music or podcast.",0
"I've enjoyed and had a great experience with Spotify for years, but a recent update (I assume anyways) has caused the controls to disappear when playing music, and also to cut out sporadically. I've seen that others have reported the same so I hope this can be rectified soon, or I'll be moving to another provider.",0
Plz remove adds as because ther are continuously 2 to 3 adds at list remove 2 adds and give 1 adds,0
It logged out automatically at the end of the day.. really inconvenient.,0
"Awesome & Great App For Music Entertainment In Every Wher On Easy To Use. So,Everyone Can Enjoy Of This App For Entertainment Or Relax Owen Way,That's A Quality Way To Do.",1
Its a headache There are too many ads and it will make you uncomfortable when you in a way of your own life of music ðŸ¤¬,0
"Used to be able to listen to a sample of a song on the mobile app. Can't do that anymore. Also, when I search for stuff I'll click add nothing happens. I can't tell if something has gotten added. Then it immediately bounces to the search screen so I'm unable to add more from that particular artist or album. At this point I have to go back and search for the artist or album again to add a song. Adding a handful songs can be quite tedious.",0
ita good app,1
Not gonna lie it's an amazing app you get to listen to your favorite songs and yea there's a little bit of skips and adds but when you get the premium it's a lot better this app is way better than any other music app well in my opinion yk but yea this is an amazing app and others should download it as well,1
I really enjoy the music & podcast offerings of this app. The wide range of choices is so good.,1
It doesn't matter if I click 'allow' or 'Maybe later' - Every single time I navigate to the app it asks me whether I will allow it to connect to Bluetooth. And it is driving me crazy! Just stop it!!!,0
"Doesn't allow you to modify Your Shows on homepage. I have listened to maybe one that shows up, and the podcasts I actually do listen to are nowhere to be listed.",0
"I've had Spotify for 2 years now, but I'm uninstalling after they decided to remove Neil Young's music instead of removing COVID misinformation. I guess I'll just settle with YouTube Music now ðŸ™ƒ",0
Very  experience to much bro,1
"My personal experience is amazing, I don't like ads though but still I am using it for free not the paid version, so everything is good.",1
"Been using the app for years, but the latest update causes it to randomly pause music. Very frustrating!",0
"This could have been 5 stars from me but the non premium users have to go through 3-4 ads now??? Its really annoying just one ad is enough spotify... Edit. Purchased Premium, and its wayy better, sound quality goes to ""very high"" (256kbps) and its great! But i know a lot of people wont be able to purchase premium so...",0
I LOVE THIS APP. but... BUT... The new update man. I've had this for over a year or two and WHY CANT I PREVIEW SONGS WHEN I AM ADDING THEM TO A PLAYLIST. WHAT THE ACTUALLY HELL. Ok otherwise 5 stars,0
Love this app but too much ads,0
Works do hood and plays my favorite music,1
been using spotify for quite long..but i have a problem when i want to pay for my premium..even after i check everything and re install the app again,0
Gives you the best musical access experience,1
The best app ever I would totally recommend it to a lot of people love you Spotify,1
"Was decent, Now awful. A company that speaks about not being into censorship just went nuclear on free speech... just cancelled my subscription that I've had for over 2 years good job",0
"Excellent!!! My sister got me a subscription, and it is the best gift she has ever given me!!!",1
It's too much ads. Sometimes it goes 3 to 4 ads continue.,0
Great App. This is a great app but the only problem is that Spotify removes songs so YouTube Music actually has more songs. Although it is better than youtube music from my experience,0
Cannot access my downloaded albums offline. Pixel 6 pro,0
"Developers release new updates that aren't tested. App keeps crashing, play list doesn't show what song is playing. I pay for a premium subscription, the least they can do is credit my account something for their less then premium service.",0
"The song which will not be found anywhere, it will be found here, it is a good app.",1
App keeps on complaining I have no internet connection. Yet other apps don't seem to have this issue. I haven't been able to use Spotify for over a week now.,0
Am new user of Spotify. Its quite good ðŸ‘,1
I like it because sound is also good and there is all. BTS ARMY SONGS,1
Advertisement from McDonald's is disturbing ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. I don't know if I'm telling someone who can hear me to fix that Please...,0
"It is nice, because you can listen to music that you like. It also picks out some songs that you may like from your past history inside the app.",1
Too many glitches for a paid subscription app and ads on podcasts (spotify ads not the podcasters) even with premium. But when it is working its the best app for quality music downloads ive found.,0
Best app for music!!!,1
"Been having some problems. All the sudden my accout got logged out and when i try to login it says no internet connection or try again later, i dont have internet and ive tried loging in for 4 days now. Now im reinstaling to see if that works. If not, please fix!",0
The best music app. I get Prime Music as member but seldom use it. Spotify is so much better!,1
"New update broke a lot of stuff, I won't list it all because the other reviews all do.",1
Great,1
"It is the best music app . We can listen to any music of any language. Various songs , artists.",1
Great app. It would be nice to see a feature that shows you lyrics like in yt music.,1
"Great for listening music especially when you're in premium plan, but its session feature is super annoying. You need to uninstall install the app several times to make it work, which is inconvenient and hassle. I hope the team solve this bug.",0
Needs 360 audio support.,0
"been paying for premium for over a year and now they've completely ruined the purpose of this app. destroyed the listening to previews of different music to add to your playlist feature and i am quite disappointed. please bring this back, let it be accessible to all listeners.",0
I love how you have pre made playlists containing all the songs an artist has but the free version lacks too many basic features,0
"I would like to have the option to enable/desable the equaliser with easier access, and use it with the settings of each type of audio playback (headphones Jack, Bluetooth, internal speaker and Android auto) It could remember the setup for each use. Thanks",0
"I cannot buy premium,cause cant connect many times poor apps",0
"Can't see ""Now playing"" song sometimes with the last updates. Have to close and reopen spotify.",0
"Songs don't play in order, I can't just individually play a song that's already in a playlist, ads every 2 songs?? I'd rather use the built-in music app.",0
"Best music app BUT it crashes way too often and has some bugs, like play delays. Even on a brand new device with 8GB RAM. Please try optimize this.",0
Best Music app without many ads disturbance as others do,1
You should be ashamed of yourselves. 1* Uninstall until you drop the antivax propaganda podcasts.,0
I hate that I can't control what ads I hear. I hate hearing crying baby diaper ads first thing in the morning. I'd rather not use Spotify at all than pay $120 a year to rent -RENT- music.,0
slow as hell and takes long to open,0
Great Playlist an affordable prices,1
I think it's amazing all the way I can listen to when I'm playing my games and I think they should add more songs and it's amazing thanks for the fabulous app,1
Why is liking the songs so difficult? Should not be a 3 click process. I love what you do but the like button was way better in 2019. Downloads keep disappearing and its a waste of data. Was traveling. Day 1 used 90% data to download all songs and day 2 the downloads weren't there. Do better.,0
"Not worth a rating. I have spot-ad-fy and another free radio app. The free radio app may not search specific musicians, but it does give genre specific music while spot-ad-fy gives music, yes but with so many more adds. It's simply not acceptable, but oh wait, they have a subscription service add free for approximately $11.00 a month, sorry I im going free version of a free a radio everytime.",0
This is the best app to listen to music to because it has all the genres and all artists new and old. Anyone who doesn't have it should definitely get it!!!,1
I really like Spotify they always have the music I'm looking for,1
This app is great. It has all of my favorite music in one playlist!!! ðŸ•º,1
Could the app be any more glitchy. Also if you could crash a little more than 2 to 3 times a day. That would be great. Thanks,1
"Not very good very glitchy, whenever I want to choose a type of music it plays a random one",0
Good service,1
"I am an artist with original songs on Spotify ,I like the artist part were I can go right from distro kid to Spotify artist",1
Used to be great. But the ads are intense. Blth visual and every 3rd song. May as well name it adsify. I understand ads pay for apps that are free. But seriously if the ads have links and i follow the link. Whats the point. And why is the phone functionality better than your web-version. Why cant both be the same,0
The best right now. Massive selection. Reliable.,1
"Best music experience I've ever had. Easiest music app to navigate. Highly recommend. I don't have ads because I pay for premium. $6.99 a month is pretty worth it. Playback, no ads whatsoever, unlimited skips, and you can pick and choose any song you want to listen to. Definitely worth buying",1
Good music my kids use this app,1
I'm a senior at age 65. I love being able to fine old school music and current.,1
"Had my ears open d to what some of the competitors offer with hi def audio. Sorry Spotify but your quality doesn't match anymore, the podcasts are an annoying addition to my music app and the shuffle algorithm barely works. I'm out.",0
well its pretty good app but the main problem to earn money they have launched their premium plans and we are unable to play songs of our choice shuffle is alright but still wish they could do something about it otherwise its pretty decent app that provides a large variety of music,1
Best music platform,1
If you love music or podcasts you gotta have spotify. You're missing out,0
It's a awesome music app I am using it for 3years,1
"As a paying user, i find the app underwhelming. Bad android experience for a popular app. Very buggy. Always stop playing after few minutes when tablet locks. Im only using it coz it has all my fave podcast. But as an app, i feel that they could care a lot more on the interface and user experience as a whole. It needs a revamp. Do not sit on your laurels and bank only on the vast catalogs. PLEASE SPOTIFY, I want to love you, but your app disappoints more often than not.",0
"I usually love this app, but a problem has come up with the song queue. I can't open it at all, and this has only just started happing in the last few days. I upgraded to premium a couple weeks ago, not sure if that has anything to do with the issue? A lot of others Spotify users seem to have this problem too. I'm updating the app again, will see if that fixes it.",0
Best app for listening music at good quality ðŸ¤— but one thing disappointed me that is the ad... But it's the best app...â¤ï¸ #karan_junjadia,1
"Better for listening to podcasts than music as none of the adverts are skippable and you can't go forward or backwards when listening to songs without Premium. Also 2 criticisms with the shuffle system: 1) good luck listening to newly added songs and 2) when listening to liked songs, I expect to listen to songs in that playlist, not something that's 'suggested' even though I've never heard of the artist and their music is completely different to what I usually listen to.",1
premium is premium,1
"I enjoyed listening music and you mix it in a way that i like, thank you",1
"Very few times, the touch screen is not working. Otherwise fine and satisfied. Thanks for everything.",1
Best music aap,1
Great music coverage. I remember old times. Lovely,1
Doesn't seem to stay playing when in background mode since the latest update and cuts out mid song then randomly starts again. (On a S21+),0
"Music always cuts in and out like it's a scratched cd playing, so annoying. Pandora or Amazon prime doesn't do that all.",0
"Shuffle and Autoplay are the most frustrating, annoying and useless feature ever added out of any app that exists on this platform",0
It is the best app for listening songs and join streams. I really really live Spotify and would recommend it to others too.,1
It's awesome i enjoy listening to the tunes that makes everything better and my days to get bye.,1
I am unable to use the scan function on spotify and i demand to know why,0
why remove the toggle button for offline mode as most users rely on the quick function to save data usage? won't be renewing my subscription,0
It's cool and you can also listen to any kind of music you want but there is kind of a problem every time you leave an rejoin it kind of freezes So if you fix this problem I will give it 5 stars Bye-bye,0
Was working good for about week untill yesterday when it needed an update now all of my liked songs won't play all the way through only plays 15 seconds of it and I've gotten ahold of customer but nothing was resolved I've tried restarting my phone unistalled the app reinstalled the app and same issue still Accurs,0
"Recently app is not showing any music playing when there is so I cannot pause or skip. Music is also pausing for a few seconds mid way through song repetitvely, may be a loading issue.",0
Why so many ads two songs you get 5 ads. ????????????,0
"Keeps having weird crashes. Either is stuck on play and you cannot close the music. New bug is ""spotify trying to play music"" on notifications and music playing without player showing so you can close it only by force closing app in phone app settings. Using on Huawei p30 pro",0
Been a very nice music app that so far has every song and/or artist that I've searched and played. Very good would recommend it ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘,1
Highly refreshing entertainment... top notch tunes to the max,1
I love how the app plays the series of audio for the source I selected.,1
Really like the price of the monthly fee muisc is never ending plus i litsen to my Daily horoscope n daily podcast of everything ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘,0
"Latest update causing significant issues with play/pause options. Random playing of podcasts after the app has closed. Been using Spotify Premium for years and this is by far the worst series of updates I've experienced. Please fix it, I'd hate to take my music listening elsewhere.",0
"Hi, I love this app. I have it on my phone and tablet, but there's differences between them. Firstly, on my tablet, I can chose any song I want to play. On the other hand, my phone doesn't let me play a specific song, and when I'm playing my playlist, some random songs just play. Please fix this stuff that happens for free version. Not everyone wants to pay for the subscription, like me. Just make it equal because I just want to play music I like and don't get the chance because of this.",0
99.9% of all the stuff I've searched for I have found.,0
Songs are albums wont play instead it would just be blank,0
I love the music on here and overall it functions well except for when I get an advertisment like every other second,1
"Very glitchy on my phone, tracks keep pausing randomly. Says I'm playing something I'm not and doesn't update display, so says I'm still listening to a podcast I played yesterday when I'm actually listening to something else. Really annoying and not what I expect for a paid-for service.",0
"songs are good, but ads are pissing me off in my sleep",0
"Fantastic app..... Lately it plays without displaying the play bar. You can't pause or skip, unless you exit out of the app",1
"Very nice, they just need to add the option to add a song to multiple Playlists",1
Often crashes when trying to start playing a file.,0
"Every time my phone is rebooted for some reason, Spotify reverts the storage setting from SD to internal. It seems Spotify is starting before the SD card is fully mounted and there are multiple support threads, going back many years, about this and it's still not fixed. They've ignored years is requests to sort this and as such, it's still not possible to trust the download feature of the app. It's a real shame because the service is great otherwise. Support doesn't seem to care at all.",0
"How do you get the bloody thing to stop automatically playing when my car connects to Bluetooth!!??? My God it's such a pain!!! Close the app? Nope doesn't work. Search in vain for a stop or exit button? Nope. Cant find anything. Uninstall app until you want to use it again, then reinstall? Yep. Only thing I've found that works. Now also adding the frustration of no way to rewind a podcast if you miss a few minutes and want to go back and hear it again. Have now uninstalled for good.",0
Usually no issues. Lately different story. Its connecting to my bluetooth connections randomly and playing. But i didnt say connect or play does on its own. But entire time i can not change song or stop the music. Unless i turn my phone off and back on,0
Great experience the premium options are very affordable and the app works well with alxea,1
Ads are definitely a little aids but it's better than everything else.,1
"I think my original post dissaperd, but that's besides the point it's a good app I love the variety of different types of music however the app has been acting weird today I noticed that I can no longer listen to a part of the song that I want to add before adding it and its been opening at random times all day today and the app itself won't even be open for some reason circus by Brittany Spears will randomly start playing and I'll have to open the app and close out of it completely so it stops",0
"I recomend using spotify on your computer because it has less adds and, lets you skip to what ever song you want without listing to other songs first. I also get better signal on my phone.",0
"used for 3 years, and I felt like the ads are increasing. Almost after every one song would be followed on by an ad, and it's always the same ads. Not everyone can afford premium.",0
"Started playing ads when the app is closed (including forced stop), and even in the middle of podcasts without pausing it. Otherwise, it's good",1
STOP GIVING ME THAG STUPID SMALL BUSINESS AD EVERYTIME I GET THAT AD IT ADDS MORE REASON FOR ME TO SWAN DIVE OFF A BRIDGE. AND I CANT LISTEN TO A FEW SECONDS OF A SONG ANYMORE WHEN I ADD SONGS.,0
A+ you can find any song from anywhere you have to try this app for playing your music,0
The app is so easy and fast to use I love it,1
"App worked well for a week, now I can't even play a single song because it won't load when I hit play. This update sucks as bad as the last one did.",0
Spotify is addictive.,1
I absolutely love it,1
The BEST ever. I love Spotify and it's suggestions. It surprises me every time I think of listening to something other than my usual playlist.,1
"It's all true music,and lots of podcasts.",1
"Very consistently, Spotify will be loading a playlists indefinitely. Restarting usually does nothing. Why has this been a consistent problem for YEARS??",0
The app crashes everytime I change songs. Wth,0
This app used to be the best music app but ever since the update a while ago I can't listen to specific songs unless I pay. If I try to it only gives me a sample. Now I use Spotify only on my Google Home Mini and the rest I use SoundCloud you can choose song and everything. Just like the old Spotify ðŸ˜ž,0
"App never keeps up with what song I'm on in a playlist when i play through Alexa, and it's been that way for 2 phones now so it's definitely the App! Have to force stop the app just to get it to work again",0
very good wide range of music and songs,1
Podcasts are annoying.... I want a setting to shut off podcasts and not show them at all in the app. They just add clutter and I'm only interested in music. I'm also a premium family subscriber and would really like a pricing tier that completely eliminates podcast from the app for me. I don't want to pay Rogan's salary or contribute to the demise of Gimlet.,0
So many bugs going on in my phone. Sometimes I can't play any tracks. Sometimes the app just close by itself. This is so disappointing.,0
"I cancelled twice and found to my surprise I was still being charged... The issue was resolved after I contacted customer service, but got refund only for the last month. I felt that I've been tricked.",0
Junk. Use YouTube premium. App no longer works on Xbox either. Add that to the reason to no longer use this app. Very glad I cancelled premium.,0
Facing an issue that app is just crashing while song is just played Phone: vivo V21e Plan: Individual premium.,0
"Great service but latest update broke the app. Randomly stops playing, sometimes music plays but control bar doesn't show up until you restart app. Widget no longer works. Have tried reinstalling several times to no avail. Will happily revert review once fixed.",0
New update is amazing with the enhance feature,1
New update is terrible. I can't see the songs I'm playing!? So bad.,0
"Started off well and got premium. New update makes the screen go black when in Google maps which is really dangerous considering it happens when driving. After the new update, they took the ""enhance"" button away from the liked songs Playlist which is 85% of the reason I started using the app. To add insult to injury, I've emailed support and it's obvious they don't understand what I'm trying to tell them in the first place.",0
The now playing/media control bar has started to randomly disappears after a while if the app has been backgrounded and you cant get it back unless u fc the app ðŸ‘Ž Edit: still broken ill make my own instead,0
Spotify is best music app Only I have problem is ads .,1
Ads free with full music on,0
This app used to be flawless ever since the last few updates my app crashes all the time never loads my liked songs when offline even though they are downloaded. Wish I could change it back to what it was before the updates,1
I like the app but the shuffle option is disturbing pls remove it,0
When i Started using Spotify It Worked Great. But Lately It Keeps On AutoPlaying Other Song. Its So Annoying and It Makes My Spotify App To Glitch Making It Impossible To Play The Song That I Wanted To. Its Like Spotify Is Forcing Me To Pay For The Music That I Wanted To Play. Because You Need To Pay Subscription To Disable AutoPlay.,0
S22 Ultra. When this app works it is great. Some times it plays well with its own echo system and google assistant. Some times after a update or new harddware things go from Huh thats weard to totoaly spotty usability. I pay for preimum so it is a bit of a problem when it dont work so great. Most of the time it is great...,0
Very nice  app,1
After the last update the songs keeps stopping,0
Earlier app was very good and 2 ads come at a tym now 4-5 ads come at a tym and is very difficult to listen on it and network problem is also there,0
The app is absolutely fantastic. I enjoy myself anytime I use.,1
"Tricky to listen to albums (if downloaded) when offline, but that's the only reason it isn't a 5-star review from me because otherwise it's excellent!",1
Premium smells good but basic is similar to toe cheese,0
Really annoyed about how much ads there are. You listen to 2 songs then get hit by ads,0
This app is good you can listen to any song you like,1
Good application for audio ðŸŽµ I like it this app,1
There is no option to change lyrics language ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬,0
I love Spotify but recently it doesn't open for me it doesn't load any songs I've been paying for it for the past few years and I've been paying for it recently and I haven't been able to use it what's really going on with its does anybody know why Spotify is not working uninstalled it and reinstalled it and nothing,0
"I loved using spotify until the recent update that removed song previews, now it's next to impossible to make new playlists. How am I expected to add songs if I have no idea what they even sound like.",0
WP immune,1
When i play music from this apps my brain is relaxing. This is my stress reliever,1
Best music app i have ever used no cappðŸ™Œâ¤,1
"All my favorite music, no commercials. Win/win",0
the app used to be awesome but the most recent update is super buggy.,0
What the hell is wrong my Spotify suddenly got offline,0
I mean i like this app its got all the music i need and want but there are just tooo many adds there are sometimes like 2 adds together i dont even listen to 4 songs and there are 7 adds it is gravely frustrating plz fix this.... but other than that this app is great....,1
I will go on it a get I song I dont know or dont like and it will say have use all my skips but haven't use it in age ok so me from 3 month later I have not use this a in about 2 months and still says I have no skips,1
The premium version (the ad-free one) is good.,1
"Spotify premium is so worth it!!! No ads, Unlimited music plays, download Playlists and podcasts to listen to offline. Great app, would recommend premium.",0
Why you added that hiding feature? Because it sucks when I want to unhide any song!,0
"The app is extremely buggy now a days. I love the service, the app is garbage",0
"Removed too many features for free users, you cannot preview songs by an artist or see thier top songs, meaning there is no way to find all of an artists songs. Shuffle play only plays about 10 songs from an 8 hour long playlist. Spotify promoted podcasts very strongly on the home page taking up a lot of the space, this wouldnt be much of an issue if I cared about podcasts, some of these podcasts have had disturbing or suggestive covers, I don't want to see these when I go to play music.",0
Its a best podcast and music playing platform,1
I love the app. Been using it for many years,1
"Don't know what has happened in the latest update but there are so many bugs! Try restarting a song doesn't work, skipping to previous song doesn't respond as usual I have to press numerous times, android auto with Spotify is now a mess. Next update revert back to the previous version it was fine!",0
"Disappointed. Every two weeks it seems that the servers go down and the music is unable to play for days at a time. For an app I pay for monthly, it would be nice to be able to use it. I don't understand how this is such a common occurrence.",0
"This has been my favorite music provider for years but I'm highly disappointed in all the glitches I've been experiencing these past few months. If things don't get fixed soon, I'll have no other option but to change music streaming services.",0
Last update has tons of bugs! The play bar won't show so I can't pause the music. I have to shut the whole app to do that. The music will also shut off in the middle of a song for no reason. Not thrilled with this premium experience.,0
"An offline version should be developed, Meanwhile the app is nice,appreciated.",1
It's an awesome app but the only thing wrong is that it has no offline option so pls fix that,0
Very good experience,1
"This app has begun crashing and won't display the play bar, so I can't pause the song or see the lyrics or skip the song. I pay for this app and use it for work, I will have to use a new platform if this continues.",0
This is the best listening app I have ever seen before so I am giving 5 starâ˜ºâ˜º,1
Good music and I love how it can be played in the background.,1
can't buy premium.. the app is always error when I'm trying to pay,0
"Use to be ok, Listen to 30 sec comercial and get 30 mins of uninterupted music. Now it sucks, listen to one or two songs and then hear two mins of commercials. This only started during covid pandemic and now all they do is beg for people to pay for premium spotify to stop ads. Im almost ready to delete this app totaly. Dont download this app, youll hate it.",0
"I've been using the premium subscription for years. I've never had issues with the apps, and generally find their updates to be intuitive. I live in South Korea and while some older songs are still romanized, most have the lyrics in Korean. It is frustrating that you can't change the language settings in the app, it follows the language your phone is in. But to me the music quality, quantity and download options make up for it. Overall a nice service that's worth the price.",1
The app keep crashing everytime I play a song I guess after the recent update really terrible,0
Everything about Spotify Is ..SPOT ON !I Love All Kinds Of MusicðŸ‘ðŸ’—,1
They are giving too much of ads,0
I love it but if you don't have a connection it's useful,1
"Love Spotify, if it was recorded, you can usually find it here!!",1
awesome access to tunes however continuous disconnection to Samsung Galaxy phones. On my 2nd one and repeatably days no internet connect. Have reinstalled. Cleared cache. Very annoying.,0
Well at first it was 5 stars now I have to say 2 stars. Now I can't see who is playing can't stop the music if I want to. Have to uninstall and reinstall then it acts right for awhile. This was my favorite. Guess I have to go to Pandora till you guys fix SpotifyðŸ˜­,0
Extremely satisfying,1
"I've been paying for over a year now and it was awesome at first, but every time it updates, it gets progressively worse. Several months ago, it stopped showing the music in my drop down (I have a Samsung S8, so the phone shouldn't be ""too old"" for this function), now it's removed artists from my library that I've downloaded, stops in the middle of the song/podcast, and over the past couple days it's stopped working altogether. Idk if it's just a bug, but PLEASE fix this!! It's so frustrating.",0
why did u have to make changes to Spotify it was better before now it doesn't even play my playlist anymore,0
Okay but the play bar at the bottom of the screen is not appearing. I will play a song and nothing will show but it will play. I can't pause anything or skip or like.,0
It's cool. Can find and play any cool songs,1
Nice app but please remove the ads without premium,0
"Spotify is an awesome Music platform! All Genres of music can be found,podcasts are also represented. ðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ¶â¤ðŸ’¯",1
"The best music app , period !",1
"If I could rate this a 0 I would, My name is Hannah and I'm 11 and I absolutely hate this app. I downloaded it and signed in made a playlist and what happend you may ask, well they added what they wanted onto it, it's so rude and when I tried to delete it of it said that I couldn't because they had picked it special for me, and it wouldn't let me play any other songs in my playlist, so just like that an hour after I down loaded it it's been installed an hour later. I'm never downloading again",0
Amazing selection of music and podcasts. Buggy operating system where bugs seem to come and go :-(,1
I love this app,1
This last update had really killed the app. It's very glitchy. I play a song and the navigation and currently playing menu is not there. I have to close and reopen the app to see it.,0
"I get that you need to show ads to be profitable and grow your company but the amount of ads your app is showing me is just crazy, I counted the ads last time, I was playing a playlist and after playing minimum 1 to maximum 3 songs this app showed me a 30-50 seconds ad, in other words 5-6 ads in an hour. You do realise that you're just driving me away instead of persuading me to buy the premium? Please reconsider your ad amount.",0
"The latest version is extremely buggy. Music stops for no reason, sometimes lose the play/pause buttons while music is playing and you have to exit the app and restart it. Looking forward to the next update which will Hopefully fix the bugs",0
Amazing Seriously idk how to explain it My only issue is that sometimes the lyrics are incorrect or late,0
When I click on a song it plays this song I'm not clicking on,0
Works well but room for improvement in sound quality,0
"Everything that is added makes this app worse. I don't want a 3 second video instead of the album art. I don't want my playlists to get ruined every other update. JUST STOP UPDATING, YOU ARE ACTIVELY MAKING IT WORSE",0
"App takes forever to load...like over 1 min. Program is very slow to start playing, but works after. Don't know if it is because it is downloading songs or if it is a memory hog. I have my songs on an SD card.",0
A great app with millions of songs just right for you,1
"Overall...Meh. Selection and audio quality is pretty good but the navigation is horrible. Same goes for Android Auto version. Way too many taps to get to common areas. Also, it's integration with Google speakers is less than desirable.",0
"When I try to play a song it always shows"" this playlist is empty. Go to Home to find playlists just for you. how to resolve this issue?",0
Played songs on phone when I didn't want them to. Didn't play assorted songs when I did. Played songs repeatedly and wouldn't update like it should. Not coming back.,0
"This app just makes me angry tbh. Sure it plays the songs you tell it to but you can't chooses other ones, there is limited skips, the ads I don't mind but what j can test and there the random songs that get recommended into you playlists, EVEN THOUGH I ALREADY TURNED OFF THAT SETTING. This is just stupid I don't get why they would add this I don't even think anyone keeps it on, it just ruins my whole day to be honest, I hope they fix it.",0
If your looking for a quality music app Spotify Is the one,0
Great. Not impressed with ads built in to podcasts though. I pay premium to avoid these intervals,0
"Bad update , can see the song that is playing or skip or skip back",0
Why is it not possible to only show the downloaded songs in my library? that's the only way I always listen to music :(,0
It is really a good app.but lyrics can be developed,1
Best application for music and podcast. It's premium features are also awesome. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,1
"youtube is way better than this, i cant play my song that i pick instead it just play random song in a playlist",0
Spotify is my favourite music streaming service.,1
Deleting this app.. Bcz I dont listen to songs what I listen are advertisements and not 1 or 2 its 5 at a time.... I gave it 5 star as a gift and switching spotify to gaana atleast they made me hear songs,0
Outstanding and best of the songs i love it,1
Best audio streaming app. ðŸ˜Š,1
Love all my playlist that Spotify creates for me!,1
Everything works smooth and really enjoy it! They're always making improvements,1
There so ad and makes me anger cause whenever my mood to listen song but whenever ad start play its very annoying after ad i really not want open Spotify plz we don't need any ads it's so annoying,0
It's a shame that you can't give 0 stars on an app. Spotify used to be the best music app but now it's horrible like seriously 6 SKIPS PER HOUR! Also on top of that when you make a playlist it adds a bunch of songs and you can't stop it so you have to deal with songs you don't like. And the adds are so long it used to be 30 seconds for 30mins which I can deal with bet 1min of ads for 2 songs! ITS DESPICABLE!!!,0
Amazing app,1
Every few days when I open the app it asks me to log in even thi I never logged out.,1
Hacked and constant crashes,0
After update apps keep crashing pleas fix it!!! PS: install Spotify lite for continue listening for temporary solution until got fixed. Hope it helps,0
Its annoying and frustrating when I can't play my downloaded songs. Makes me feel anxious to point that I threw my phone.ðŸ™„,0
Fantastic app music is awesome,1
If you love music this is the best 11mo you can spend ,1
I subscribed 3 times this time.. only one is successful.. but money were deducted and not returned. Premium experience is good but.. this payment experience is annoying. It's fourth time and money got deducted and no premium available for me,0
Why are you turning off my video when I put it in Bluetooth mode absolutely stupid! You're lucky you're getting one star,0
I love this app it's reliable and if you don't have unlimited data you can download all of your liked songs and playlists with premium,1
I love Spotify,1
This is so fun,1
"I cant played the song in my playlist. The new update is trash, who even thought of that? They reshuffled my playlist. I cant now enjoy my favorite songs thanks to this update. Please remove it it's annoying.",0
I have been using many music aps in the past 10 years or so... I find Spotify the best one in terms of functanality and ease of use... Still few improvements required like usage in poor network areas... Need to fix that,1
Why the hell am I getting adverts before podcasts when I pay premium??,0
Easy and keeps old with the new,1
Very pleased with spotify,1
Good sound quality,1
It's the worst. Doesn't let me to sign up and gives me all kinds of stupid errors. I'm sooo done with this app.,0
They deleted 71 episodes of the Joe Rogan podcast and I am appalled. I became a subscriber to Spotify specifically for the JRE and now Spotify is deleting episodes. I will cancel my subscription once this month is up due to their decision on this matter.,0
"Spotify started inserting ads into podcasts, even for premium members.",0
Love the music but only problem is you can't download the songs,0
"Spotify is great, but there's a few niggles that make it a bit annoying. The 'car mode display' is no longer working, so i can't see what song is on my screen (it times out and locks after 30 secs). There's no ability to set where a song starts (for example) 30 seconds in (ie for songs that have an annoyingly long, spoken intro). There's no way of connecting songs that 'should' be played back to back so that they stay attached even if shuffle mode is on. Apart from this though, it's amazing!",0
Great music selection,1
Bruh what the hell i want to play my song then it play a aong THAT I DONT LIKE FIX THIS DUMBAS THING ðŸ¤¬,0
Always problems. Yesterday is wouldn't play over bluetooth. Today all the controls are missing. My favorite longest occurring issue is when I set it to play only downloaded music while on cellular (offline mode) it just won't play anything at all or will restrict me to downloaded stuff even though I'm connected to wifi.,0
Excellent a very good selection and up-to-date.,1
The payment has been twice and still not credited. And sometimes the app stops working. How can I get my 129 which I paid twice back?,0
wonderful app without add we can listen ultimate songs,1
I find the apps now don't have the play button . It plays for 2-3 songs then stopped . Kinda frustating . Can't even stop or skip the song as there is no button for that .,0
"Didn't ever use Spotify until Joe Rogan came onto the platform. Now I use it for all my podcast and music streaming. Keep speech free! Update: App hasn't worked for a month. Have uninstalled reinstall, tried everything.",0
This is my best streaming service for music in the world.,1
"Useless, I live in Quebec so cannot have premium. Better going amazon music .",0
It's the best music app I have had you can get any album song podcasts unless you have to pay for it but other than that it great,1
"The only thing for me is with the lyrics, since I listen to kpop (korean pop) the lyrics come up in Korean unless there are English parts. So I wish there was a way you could translate to where all the lyrics are in English.",0
i love this app so much! you can find your favorite songs yea there might be some adds but its better than a app that scammed you!,1
"Great app, great quality audio, no issues",1
you cant go some where and listen to music without internet.,0
"The monthly paid service is brilliant! So many songs, I always find what I'm looking for.",1
plz fix this app totally a mess not even a single song could be played it's just a mess I'm done of reinstalling for many times and face the same problem all playlists are empty and can't listen to a single song ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©,0
"I used have music while I was driving. Now I can't have music or there'll be an accident from constantly having to make sure my screen is on 24/7 like this is YouTube music. I downloaded this because I wanted to listen to music while I drive, not be a mayhem. And I do a lot of driving. So now it's just been empty space in my car for almost a year. So no 5 stars definitely until its fixed. It's a problem you don't care about I know. You have a radio. Just go home and listen then. Not the point.",0
Have premium but now it won't let me listen to my music without wifi,1
Spotify is the best music and podcast app out there. They have all types of genres just name it.,1
Why was my comment deleted for explaining how spotify has failed to fix its payment system since 2015 and the best you can do is give automated responses. Wow. At least paying for pandora took 1 second to resub. Failed business practices in exhange for snooping and spying,0
Everything is great but ads are annoying sometimes i get 3 to 4 ads continuously,0
"After updating everytime it needs to be updated, I can no longer play downloaded songs offline ( I cannot play the songs anymore even Im not connected to internet/data). Offline mode doesnt even work or seems useless. I've read other with same issue, I hope this will be solved soon. ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜” The lyrics for the songs as well, if you play it on PC, the lyrics does not fit the screen, sometimes delay.",0
"Not just brilliant for music, but excellent for podcasts too.",1
"I like Spotify, but the android app has been glitchy and buggy for a long time Newest update broke the app. Now playing bar doesn't show up half the time, and it won't let you select songs until you restart the app. .",0
"I like using this on My PC but the problem is I have using this on my mobile, how come I can't pick a song I want to play on my Playlist and how come I can't restart the song all the way to the beginning if I want to? whats the point having a minute line if you can't drag your dot anywhere? third of all, whatever I skip a song or played a song, it won't let me go back to the previous song I was before its just lazy.",0
The new update is very bad.I can just hear a few seconds of my songs in my playlist,0
Easy to find songs,1
Great to listening to music,1
"Spotify has been playing up the last few days, someone fix it please! The play screen doesn't appear so when you play a song, you can't see what's playing, and you can't stop what's playing because there are know play/pause controls",0
This app is fantastic,1
Super ,1
Love listening to my favorite podcasts on Spotify â¤,1
It is the best place to hear music and I like it and got primum plan it is the best love you spotify,1
It sucks I use it when i can't find a certain thing on SoundCloud but that's about it. It's pretty trash,0
"I would like to alert the developers to a current bug in the software. My phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note 9. I tried curating a queue, after queueing 5 songs, the app experienced an error (no error code), and all queued songs disappeared from the queue. This happened twice in a row. I love the app and pay for premium. I would love for the app to queue as many songs as I want, as it used to, thanks. Also, discover weekly shouldn't play songs already liked or previously played in discover w",0
Spotify is the best.. enough said.,1
Recent updates have made this app really buggy. From the play bar disappearing to the search just not returning anything. It sucks.,0
It's good ðŸ‘ quality is amazing every song is available. As I am a Drama fan so i love that it also have OST. But I can't get lyrics of any song I know there aren't lyrics for every song but I can't get it on any song. Please help me. Thank you -Amazing App,1
Never any problems..always really good songs very easy to use the app..thanks Spotify for making lists from different artists and bands just from the music I listen to when I open your app new songs are waiting for me from you ðŸ¥°,1
One of my favourite online music player. My first preference for the users. Less much of ads compare than other music apps. Strongly recommended,1
*edit: so many features are broken and don't work. Getting worse Great except the podcast player is not as good as others (deleting downloads already listened to/sorting) Recently offline mode is horrible to use. Songs and I have downloaded won't play/are greyed out and say internet is not available. If I reconnect to wifi all my downloads become available next time I disconnect. A day without internet will cut my downloads out. Very frustrating when cellular data or internet is not easy to get.,0
"the app itself is great, though for a while now (the problem occurs only on mobile for me at least), the song doesn't appear to be playing at all, and I can't control it (can't skip the song, pause, or even see what the name of the song is) EDIT: forgot about another bug that I have gotten: songs sometimes stop mid-song, especially when im on some other app or game while listening to whatever on Spotify other than these bugs, great app",0
"Used to be good, now unusable. Doesn't play music anymore, only for a few seconds before stopping, no visible player so on the rare occasions it works I can't even pause or skip songs.",0
"Latest update has made the 'Now playing' bar disappear so I cannot use the scrubber, pause, or set a sleep timer and more. Device: Samsung Galaxy S10",0
Very nice good work but remove those ads,0
Good but many ads,1
"Spent the better part of a work day trying to get podcasts to play. The person I spoke to on Twitter was nice enough but by the time we reached ""restart your WiFi"" I was over it. Songs play just fine but podcasts won't, how is that a WiFi problem? I've downloaded the app on my phone and PC multiple times, restarted everything, podcasts still will not play. This is a new problem so I'm not ready to cancel my service YET, but it's also day 3.",0
Very good for easy listening away from home system! Variety of selection is great in multi-cultural environment. ðŸ˜,1
Latest update has a huuge bug. Stops play. Skips randomly. Refuses to go backwards in a playlist. Only happens when connected to Bluetooth or casting and it's only this app not a phone issue.,0
"Didnt care for Spotify at 1st.. BUT ONCE I learned how it worked I FREAKING LOVED IT!! I love how it somewhat ""Learns"" the user & makes Playlist for the user on a day to day basis. It also keeps you up to date with other songs new & old! DEFINITELY WORTH DOWNLOADING! I also like how you can use Spotify & also do other things on your device without it ever Interrupting your JAMZ! Oh yeah, also if you have Premium, you can download music and use even when you have ""No Service* #UseItDaily",1
"ok, Spotify premium is awesome but- when you get off of premium you cant even choose your own songs to listen to. you have to listen to it on *shuffle.* dumb reason to get mad but this pissed me right off. what the hell? lemme choose what song *i* wanna listen to. update : now it keeps crashing and im on premium.",0
I love this app but there's ONE problem. Ads. Everytime I try to relax and listen to music an ad comes up and it's annoying.,0
The app was one of the best (maybe the best music app) but after the latest update it became one of the worst not letting u play the song u want and plays others songs,0
The best,1
Much better than Napster which I have subscribed to for more than a decade.,1
This app would become best for music if there was no ad intrepution in between of songs.I have been using this app for almost two years and I am irritated from intrepution in between my favourite songs .This is ridiculous and if this keeps going on that day is close where this app will be in corner of darkness with no customer.,0
Spotify is the best music app ever. It give only one ads of 30 seconds and you can listen uninterrupted song for 30 min.â¤ï¸ And this app has quite smooth experience ðŸ™‚ must download it.,1
"Spotify sucks, SoundCloud is better. Whenever I try to play my playlist of the songs that I have added, it always play suggested songs. Seriously Spotify without premium subscription sucks.",0
Awesome I love it the various options to choose from,1
Playback controls have disappeared,0
"Same issues as most after this last update, song stops playing randomly and have to reopen app to play again, 'now playing' bar disappears.",0
Its lovely i love listing songs and its highy coality,1
"So far I'm loving it. I'm not tech savvy, so I'm still on a learning curve. But so far I'm really enjoying it.",1
"Bring back the feature where, when I select podcasts in my library, each show is listed in order of most recently updated and has a subtitle saying when it was updated. Knowing if an episode came out today or yesterday is useful information, most podcasts drop different types of episodes on different days. Please stop removing useful features for no apparent reason. Still buggy, every time they patch something, something else starts acting weird. Again having premium makes no difference.",0
Absolutely Iove this thing,1
New update are so trash lmao only 6 skip per hour ? This is music app or game ???? We use to listen why you don't let me chose a song that i want to listen ??,0
Only problems r they put like 4 adds about premium it's very annoying and they put songs into the Playlist I make and when I get rid of them they just add more,0
I have had Spotify for a very long time and just recently I have had it take so long to open and when it does open it says I don't have any internet when I'm connected to internet and in all it just drives me crazy and if y'all don't fix it I'm going to delete it and never use y'all's app again,0
"This app has some of the best features I've ever seen. Perfect for those who are ever-engaging with the genres they love. That being said, there are a multitude of performance issues, as well as some annoying bugs that do not appear to be fixable via the documented solutions. An easy 5-star if these get fixed.",1
"Wow, I love this app so muchâœŒï¸ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ The lyrics experience is splendid ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥",1
I love making doffrent playlist and they have everything but they changed it from on 30 second ad every 30 mineuts to 3-6 30 second ads before 30 mineuts no ads and its kinda annoying,0
This is a great app but at times it just refuses to launch. Has been like this on and off for a couple months now. Slightly frustrating.,0
"I really enjoy listening to music,but the thing that annoys me SO much are the ads. I don't wanna pay to listen to music without ads .. I honestly like the way you have y'alls playlist's listed and arranged. I'd have a better experience if there was ""less"" ads . No ads would be awesome! But I'd like less ads.. You can listen to this music on any app, sometimes it pauses. Which ..is good! But back to the positivity..I love listening to the music while half asleep. So relaxing lol! Overall,lovee!",1
Love having easy access to my favorite music.,1
"I used to love spotify so much but since 1 or 2 weeks I can't play my dowloaded songs anymore because it says ""no wifi available"". The whole reason I got spotify premium was to be able to play songs offline and now I can't",0
Deletes songs every so often,0
"Great app! I like the pocket-friendly subscription plans. But it suddenly started showing ""No internet connection"", and my wifi is clearly working",0
"This app is not good I try registerating three account but, it say 'samething went wrong' or 'this account is already registered' so when I put password it say 'this is incurrent password' even tho I have written somewhere before registerating I'm not satisfied with this app please do something. I thing I already made 4 account but still I can't enjoy this app features. Please please",0
So simple and easy and the recommendation are dope af,0
"Charges 10 fold for trial - $10 instead of $3/3 months being regular price; gets snagged after about an hour & won't play, & subtitles will not display on TV screen. Ah, now it's quitting after 10 min - via Cast. Yt, Netflix, Prime, Pandora, none have same issue",0
I enjoy the songs everyday. I do miss some movies soundtracks. Warm regards. Jeanette,1
So annoying the app stops at least twice an hour,0
Recent changes have been causing regular crashes on a Pixel. Things like: * failing to open the play/pause modal * terminating sound on navigation away from the app * terminating sound on timeout events or lock events for the phone,0
I hate this app if i want to play song it just shuffle it will not play the exactly song i want bad app,0
Great music/podcast selection but recommendation based on my preferences arent as great as youtube music.,0
"After I switch to premium account, there is problem with opening the app sometimes. That's really annoying ðŸ˜¥ðŸ¥´",0
Exelent,1
My experience is what's Spotify music app to me it's an experience the lets me make my own music .,1
"After latest update, Spotify is not working with Google Assistant and Android Auto. Revert it guys.",0
Best music app but expensive,0
"I use it for podcasts. I drive for a living. I use a galaxy s20 and keep everything updated. Weird amount of annoying bugs using this app for years. Usually running great, then odd persistent bugs. They get people to sign exclusive deals through them which is annoyingly effective way to bring me here lol.",0
"I enjoyed listening to the songs even though my cignal was weak,it never stops playing the songs",1
"Why do you need my card details for free premiumðŸ˜¡ Songs in liked list dissapears out of the blue.song search needs a lot of improvements. Anything good in this app Is its ads, very irritating, just like they wanted it.",0
"My Spotify recently has been glitching, where my music is randomly pausing, the key for the song not appearing and the widget acting as if no song is playing",0
ONLY ONE STAR BC IF I PLAY MY FAV SONG IT WON'T PLAY IT INSTEAD DAY PLAY OTHER SONG SO I GET ANNOYED WITH IT SO I ONLY GONNA GIVE IT ONE STAR IT SUPPOSED TO UPDATE IT PLSS REMOVE THAT,0
"I don't remember Spotify being this bad. It's unusable. When you click a track it begins playing it automatically but the music controls do not appear. If you check your phones media player the phone does not even recognise that anything is playing . There is no way to control the music, skip, pause or make it stop other than having to uninstall the app. This is a premium plan. It seems that, looking at other reviews, this is a common issue. No sign of it being fixed either. Do better Spotify.",0
In my opinion I really do love this app it's great for music and yuh it works really well <3,1
"they will get 5 stars back when they bring the android widget back, now i have to go find the spotify icon amongst my other apps...so much of a pain in the arse to find",0
"Terrible, I used to have no problem with spotify but now I can't even listen to the song I want to, every time I click on my song it brings me to a different song Its confusing, I really hate how on mobile you cant put songs on loop, unlike laptop or pc. It took me around 15 minutes just to play ONE song because yall wanna change the song to one I didnt pick. Also why you guys saying 30 minute ad free listening but whenever I dont even listen to TWO songs you give me a ad at the end of the 1st",0
I can't play the songs that I wanted. It's always have ads even I changed it to premium.It says there's no connection available even the connection was strong. Please fix this problemðŸ˜’,0
All collection of songs are available.. happy to use this app,1
"I have no idea why, but my spotify won't play on my phone. I've tried reinstalling it. It did work, but if i open it again later it doesn't work again. It works on my tv and laptop but why not my phone. I have premium as well, I've tried logging out, redownloading and as well as restarting my phone.",0
There are so many genres to choose from....too many and not enough time.,0
It's an great app for music.. I just love it...,1
"Love this , brilliant quality,great when out and about and ur listening to your tunes. Only down side is the upgrade to the family premium,we had so much trouble trying to all get connected not ideal for multiple ppl using ..",1
There is a wide selection of songs and it's easy to use.,1
It is always on .I have to always turn it off,0
Cheap premium worth it good songs,1
Just looking like a woooow,1
"The control bar keeps on disappearing. Once I start playing a song, I can't stop it. There's no pause/stop button. The only way to do that is by restarting my phone. Please solve the issue.",0
Great music listening experience. Would love an option to identify a song playing in the background.,0
Premium is the best music service available.,1
"This used to be a 5 star app, but your development team clearly keep making unnecessary changes just to have something to do. You got rid of driving mode 3 months ago and promised a replacement that's yet to appear so now I can no longer safely change my music while driving, and then you did something to your podcast system so that for a few months now the ""continue listening"" section of the ""new episodes"" playlist no longer works consistently. Get it together.",0
"Spotify is messed up, none of my devices playlist are linked up, the app doesn't work properly(can't see the song currently playing to be able to skip ahead, etc,...)",0
Nice app for listening songs but please make a feature to linten music offline without prenium It also dosent uses your more network than other apps,0
"Best music app on my phone. But could still make it easier to find most recent and trending music, especially in my region",0
Easy access to found favorite music,1
Spotify is tbe pest music to hear,0
Loooong time user and Love this app. However last update really messed up my galaxy note 10+. No controls at bottom during playback and stops playing during notifications? Is there a setting I missed?,0
No Stars at all!! Spotify y'all are falling off why so many ads now .. 2 years ago it was not this bad I have deleted the app it take darn 20 mins of commercial ads before music plays .. I'm not sure what y'all did to Spotify but I see y'all done messed things up that bad .. delete the app an Never download again sad!!!!!!!,0
"Best music streaming service all the time.Especially, better than Apple Music.",1
"Finding all your favorites songs in one Playlist is a great thing that a music lovers would appreciate. However I want Spotify to add an app on virtual dj that would be even more interesting than ever, I'm using android. Please add it to virtual dj. Thanks",1
Great for finding new music since you can't pick specific songs. Don't forget to 'like' the songs so they are saved and so you know the name,1
Worse app for podcast listening. Constantly fighting the interface. It will randomly without touching a thing just skip to the end of an episode even if you're halfway through. When you try to go back that episode is now listed as played so you have to go searching through the episode for where you actually where. Wish I didn't have to use Spotify but only place to get my podcasts now. With they would overhaul the whole interface.,0
Great range of songs on Spotify.,1
"I don't like when I search a song; that it doesn't let me listen right away. It puts the song in a ""playlist"" that I don't want to hear.",0
Love spotify,1
"It hasn't worked for the past two months, even after uninstalling it and downloading again. It shows albums and playlists, but every single one says it's empty. I gave it time to see if they would fix it, but two months of having no music on a music app is pathetic. Apparently it's a known issue for Androids and if reinstalling it doesn't work they say you're out of luck.",0
"All the music I need, easy to access and organize an extensive library.",0
"Great app, but adding songs to playlists is a Little difficult tbh",0
"Too much bugs in latest version, music randomly pauses, Bluetooth control not working!",0
"Yeah!!!!! I'm alllll in for free speech! I deleted because I didn't know where they stood, but I'm def using their platform since they are for free (and truthful as far as Rogan is concerned) speech.",0
I will not delet this app bc of other people find one person offensive music NOT politics i will keep paying for premium Spotify and i will sit here listen to whatever music i can before you all ruin it for me!!,0
Spotify and Amazon Alexa must have filed for a divorce! The connection between the two apps is terrible ðŸ˜« and I can no longer play songs from my library or what I wish to hear! It's always something phonetically close in the sound title but not the choice I asked to be played!!!!ðŸ˜¤,0
Love it! One of the few apps that I really like! Easy to use even for someone as technological challenged as me!!,1
"I cant log in. It says I dont have connection, I even tried with vpn , didnt work. If you re going to check it my account email is different let me know I ll tell you",0
"You persist with the do nothing (but screw up the app) updates. The ""updates"" are used to SPY on unsuspecting users. Purveyors of music have also become spies against the sheeple. To resolve your foolish policies, I've rolled back your product to a version that MET my simple needs. If it isn't broke, why ""fritz"" with it?",0
It was really good in the beginning and it was fine I had no problem with it the app itself or any of the music that was on but since the new update it will not allow me to access my playlist and six skips is all I get and I have to buy premium na please fix this,0
Impressed by the sound quality,1
Spotify is my Best Friend and my Favorite Music nothing really to Change about about it,1
I Love my Spotify ,1
It's a good app but I'd like it if people could rewind they're songs or put them on repeat that way we could just listen to the song again and only 6 skips per hour bruh who's got that kind of time at least 8 or 10 seems more fair than 6,1
If u dont buy premium They will put up so many ads thst you will be forced to buy premium Basically either u uninstall or buy premium,0
"Smooth flowing, easily find the artist that am looking for.",1
Simply the best music app have ever come across with good sound system and one thing is can do something else on the phone while playing music unlike other appsðŸ™„ which will stop playing. Awesome!,1
Spotify great listen to spotify all the time.,1
One of the best music app ever I see,1
SOMANYADS genuinely couldnt listen to two songs without getting an ad,1
This app is very good I always go to it when I want to listen to music the only problem is(unless u have premium) when u want 2 put on just one song it plays a selection so I only listen to playlists,1
"I don't understand what everyone is saying. I'm a free user and I can still play any song i want, I don't get ads and I don't have limited skips. So I don't see what the problem is. Love this app â¤",0
great music app yes it crashes sometimes but freat overall,0
Vvvv poor. Soo much ads. Didn't liked much. Mood spoiler ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,0
"I'm able to find and listen to the most obscure music here, love it.",1
Spotify is the best music platform there is more music,1
Best app for music frrr,1
Podcasts tend to stop playing. Many times the podcasts stops playing (while offering the 3 months subscription). Considering other apps.,0
"love love love spotify, always have. only complaint is that there should be more skips without paying. either way, favorite !!!",0
The play/pause button no longer shows up on pixel 6 pro,0
Music keeps cutting out. No media bar showing the song thats's playing,0
"I have loved Spotify since I got it, the premium version is incredible and pretty cheep. Algorithm is pretty good most of the time, but when it isn't pretty good it is absolutely terrible, that's the only thing that brings this down! Great app for music lovers",0
Listen to any song you desire or want. it's so good.,1
It was such a good music listening app but now after every 2 songs ad comes ðŸ˜¶ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜¶ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,0
"The ""Going For A Drive?"" notification is ridiculously annoying. Get rid",0
I liked it,1
Very disappointed. I make an all Male country station but you play nothing but suggested female artists. I made a playlist for a reason. Those are the songs I want to hear. Why not add a feature abling mixing suggested songs to a current playlist. I'm not going to upgrade to premium untill I am offered full control of playlists. I also dont like when you add a song after searching for an artist to have to search for the artist again to access their full discography. Why act like pandora and Ihrt,0
"Amazing app to listen songs like not amazing but bestest But, even if I say let's not talk about ads, yet I would complain for it like it's dude too many ads after every 3 songs that's duh! Sorry for the 3 star rating cause' if the ads sruff doesn't change then my rating won't too humbly saying thanks:)",0
Good music experience All songs r available in thisðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜,1
Why can't the 'Your Show' option be customised??? There are some podcasts i don't want to show up on my homepage. Podcasts that I've never subscribed to show up on the list. It's annoying that I can't remove them. Please add the remove option or just let us customise the damn 'Your Show'!!! This is ridiculous!,0
Love the fact that you can create endless playlist!,1
"The three stars is because it doesn't work properly, as in the music doesn't play, it glitches all the time etc Overall, good app.",0
"It's great when it is, but the only reason I stay with spotify is because I can't find anything better. That doesn't mean it's good though. I liked being able to see my recent uploads from artists I like, but thats jumped around the home page that I give up on new music. Then the scroll bar no longer does time lines or time stamps so I can't remember when I added a song so I can't find it anymore. And I can't speed scroll anymore either. They keep updating without testing it fist with review.",0
"Amazing App with very wide collection of songs, audiobooks, podcasts etc. Very comprehensive.",1
Could not function with my music! Great app,0
Best music app!!! If I could ever get a trial premium subscription would most likely give 5 stars.,0
"Inspite of using the premium version, you can't see all the song in one simple list when you type the name of the artist. It's so inconvenient to look for songs album by album. Horrible UX",0
I love it and you can play almost everything u want,1
"I can't play songs, it says I have no internet connection when I do. It's horrible! Uninstalled and reinstalled 5 times still doesn't wanna play songs. Zero stars is what y'all deserve",0
"Love ya, Spotify - bit you gotta get rid of Rogan... In the age of expensive monthly fees for streaming apps that don't really give you a lot of value for money, Spotify is the shining exception. It's the only bill I get that i actually feel I am getting a lot for what I am spending. Love it!",0
"PLEASE FIX THIS, SPOTIFY IS VERY SLOW TO OPEN ON BOTH PC AND MY MOBILE. IT JUST STAYS ON A BLANK SCREEN AFTER OPENED. I HAVE TO REOPEN THE APP MULTIPLE TIMES FOR IT TO FUNCTION",0
Good,1
Stellar music recommendation algorithm one stars less.. for lack of individual song download options Also using my smartwatch controls leads to a bug where the currently playing song is wrongly displayed.... Edit Constantly downloading songs everyone and then,0
Best podcast app out there,1
"amazing app, but I have spotify premium, it's a great service but when I started making playlists off of premium, I would get a preview of the song i put it, and now I can't on premium. please put in that features",0
im actually a yt music girlie but i moved to spotify last december 2023 - until now so far so good music can be played on background and even offline if you downloaded it what i dont like is you can only download a whole album instead of a single song,1
This is literally an amazing app for music,1
A very wide selection of music is available and the app is not complicated to use.,1
Great variety & easy to use,1
"Love my Spotify. Currently having issues with being able to see what song is playing, being able to press play or pause.",0
It's not updating my Spotify playlist its remaining at 28 hours and 13 minutes and I've added heaps of songs and its should have changed,0
Music I've never listened to wonderful ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘,1
Great app ngl ... but you should of been able to make a album of genre of song you put together,1
"I used to love Spotify, but not the past few months. Songs change randomly on me or pause, without me touching my phone. No idea why. I'm getting really annoyed and I'm about ready to switch services.",0
"It won't even start anymore, It will go to the standard black screen with logo, go black for a moment and then go back to that screen untill my phone tells me the app isn't responding. I have reinstalled the app, checked for updates, restarted my phone, it works fine on pc and others, other people have had this issue before, so fix your app please",0
This is the best music app ever is has some my fravit artis,1
Make songs move in playlist,1
That is a good music app,1
I LOVE the variety of music on Spotify! I also like it plays while Im working on other apps on my phone.,1
Never ending music pleasure,0
"Spotify is the best app for music, but still way too basic for podcast. It lacks some important features like adding shows to a playlist. Not just episodes.",0
"So you choose to cut an actual artist and musician like Neil Young but keep someone who is telling people to take horse dewormer? That's eat-the-tidepod stupid. I'm already looking for other music services and won't be a paid user anymore. When you take actual talent and trade it for false lies and misinformation, you clearly define your priorities aren't to provide either a platform for musicians nor a serious place that has real information. You don't care about users safety.",0
Great fun,1
Spotify is awesome but the app is slow and it's easy of use functionality isn't as good as it could be but it is improving. Keep up the improvements,1
"Spotify has been extremely buggy on my Samsung S22+. The biggest problem is when I open Spotify, whatever was last playing or is currently playing is not displayed in the player. It's just missing. Closing and reopening Spotify used to fix that. Lately it will persist through attempts to fix it. Has a lot of problems accessing ""offline"" content I specifically downloaded to listen to when offline. Displaying wrong dates shows were last updated ðŸ˜• Fix this buggy app!",0
1 week no adds after ads are coming not worth for music lovers,0
"Since you asked for a rating , the app has been crashing lots lately, unable to connect, no now playing bar, can't scrub songs total malfunctioning app, works at times",0
It's a great app if you like to listen to music daily just like me but the problem I face everyday is ads literally there are so many adsðŸ˜”,0
Ok I want to listen to songs but It plays four ad's instead of one or two please fix this its getting a little irritating,0
Great I enjoyed also my free one month .. awsome,1
"When I go to a radio station, I don't want to listen to the same songs on my Playlist over and over again. Even my daily soundtracks are just songs from my main Playlist I listen to. I want something new, something interesting, not just the same songs over and over again shoved down my throat. I went through and hid all the songs on my Playlist in the last radio station I listened to and it was more then half my Playlist.",0
"Pretty nice app, There arent many ads and when there are, they're not that annoying. Gives you alot of free choice moving songs in your order which is very nice -2021 It's backwards now -2022",1
I just facing a issue When we play a playlist when 1st song ends it play something totally different song that song not in a playlist also I am disappointed by this ðŸ˜•,0
Great app. Easy to use and inexpensive!,1
I use the free version. Ads are reasonable and infrequent.,0
Melhor app de msica,1
"Algorithm is good, obviously music selection superb App is buggy as all hell - constantly something wrong with it Either the Playback buttons don't appear or the current song details don't appear or it refuses to stop. Sometimes refuses to play via Bluetooth or just cuts out at random intervals. Please sort this out Spotify it's absolutely absurd",0
"When some bugs get resolved, me ones surface. The amount of times I've had to uninstall and reinstall is ridiculous. The player comes on when it feels like it and I cannot pause anything that's on. Even when I've shut the app down, the track continues. Not sure if feedback will help. First time doing so",0
"i don't know why but spotify android has suddenly stopped working on my phone. this has been happening since a few months ago. when i open the app and switch to the Library page, its empty and there's an option to create playlists despite me having atleast 5 playlists and a few blend ones. plus, whenever i try to open any playlist from Home there's either a message saying ""This playlist is empty. Switch to Home to find another playlist"" or just loads infinitely. please help me.",0
"If 4.5 were an option that's what Spotify would get. I like Spotify more than Pandora because you get more freedom, but I wish you didn't have to get premium to have no adds, or replay a song. Otherwise it's a great app, and you should download it.",1
Great app just needs to be fixed on carplay from reseting,0
"Good in many ways. But the bug that makes all my liked songs vanish is no fun at all. And it seems they are just unable to fix it. Only fix is re-install, which absolutely is not an appropriate fix.",0
Awesome song player...you can find any song under the sun!,1
The best app for streaming music!!! Who even likes Neil YoungðŸ¤£,1
It's great my whole family uses it works well has great artists albums and songs I give it a 4 because they are some songs that were on there before that are no longer on there or can't be played anymore so that's a thumbs down for me I know it's probably the artists themselves that take their own albums off Spotify but rest of Spotify is amazing thank you ðŸ˜Š,1
"In the last week, the playbar is gone except to play (no pause, forward, and back). It also does the same when on my Bluetooth in my car. And I also get 2 sec of silence every minute. Whatever Spotify did on its most recent update did more than intended, and it needs fixed.",0
"As others have posted, last month or so. Now playing media controls don't display in app or in the android notifications. Have to force close the app and try again to stop playback for now.",0
"Is it the compatibility of the app and my phone, or my music doesn't play at all. I already updated the app, uninstalled and installed it, and even purchasing a one-day premium just to listen to music, but still it doesn't load.",0
Best music streaming app I've ever used. Keep it up!,1
It'd be better to add an option to identify songs around me and make all features accessible for free.,0
"As of my last spotify recap, I USED the app for (roughly) a whole 1/3 of the year. It's a decent app id say.",1
Good music ads are touch and go on whether or not you'll want to shoot yourself by the third time around tho,1
Google assistant won't work with spotify when asking for a song in lock screen.,0
It would be cool to have a wrap feature accessible at any time Id really love to be able to see those stats any time I want to,1
Keep crashing continuesly,1
Very good music and easy to use,1
Don't like the interface when it connects to my Google maps I wish it wouldn't automatically connect,0
Awesome experience. Beuty is one can download and listen to music or podcasts offline.. The best,1
Firstly I gave it 5 start then it became laggy I can't even play music for half a second whenever I click on music to play it became stopped and throw out the app,0
Love this app I play music almost every minute of the day,1
Great app. Casting to my smart devices works great too ðŸ‘,1
Spotify: Free Music and ... Wynn wong Edit history is pubilc unless you delete the review.Learn more Rate this app,0
"Great music app and everything, I used to use spotify all the time then there was an update where you cant listen to whatever you want when you want, you can listen to a certain artist if you want but not a specific song make it really hard to find good songs, please spotify if you read this, please change it back.",0
Playlist have not been functioning properly. They'll get stuck in 5 or 6 song loops instead of playing through the entire playlist. You also can't organize your liked song playlist from oldest to newest like you can on the desktop app.,0
I like Spotify beside listening to songs there are lots of interesting stuff,1
same as other reviews with the latest update. have been using for years with premium but suddenly I'll be listening to an album and jt just stops playing. the little info bar at the bottom doesn't come up either so I can't even pause my music without shutting the app down. came to the play store hoping for a new update but hopefully there'll be a fix soon.,0
Bugs and crashes. I'm probably going to cancel my membership if not resolved by next bill cycle,0
"So far, so good. Only had a week but reasonably easy to navigate.",1
"I love the download offline option but for the past couple months it looses all the downloads after a few days! Super frustrating when you don't have reliable internet 24/7, especially when you're paying for it!",0
"Its a bit buggy sometimes but overall an amazing app, it has basically every song you can think of and plays it with great quality, I totally recommend this app to anyone who likes to listen music.",1
"Bruh, whenever u play spotify and you answer a call. there's a bug that spotify will play a music while u call (switch to speaker). actually mf this is disgustang. plz help with it",0
"Great app, really easy to navigate. However, creating playlist and discovering new songs is a NIGHTMARE. They resently removed the feature to preview the song before adding it to your playlist, making it almost impossible to find new songs, which I really dumb. They should add it back. But it's alright for listening on car trips and stuff",1
My canvas feature is not at all working. I can't share the mini-video accompanying the songs to my Instagram stories while my friends can. This issue has stuck for three months and it's not fixed.,0
I love the fact it allows me to create my own music line up. I really Love the Fact I can keep it on Replay until am tired of my favorite Songs! It's my everyday go to hands down.,1
Best in hearing songs But ads,0
"It was an amazing app but recently i can't even open my app , the songs stops on their own ....please look at my problem",0
This music app is amazing... Like it has the lyrics for every song and the lyrics are even time synced... Love this appðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–,1
"The ads have gotten completely unbearable, I'll get four or five in a row before my music is played. It also keeps recommending me and even playing songs from artists I've blocked, which is a big problem because things I have blocked trigger panic attacks. I'm completely done with this garbage, been screwd over too many times by this lousy app.",0
"Great app, if it only did what it's supposed to. Main gripe being that downloaded music is NEVER available offline. Deleted the app and reinstalled, it fixed the problem for a total of 2 days before it went straight back to not playing anything while offline. Sort it out Spotify, it's one the key features of the premium service and it doesn't work.",0
Bast app,1
The app doesn't register when songs are playing meaning you have no control of what is playing.,0
Sharing facility is very bad. This ranking only for sharing ðŸ˜¡,0
"Absolutely splendid. Lyrics, an equalizer, a huge library of songs and soundtracks. Always has just what I'm searching for. And great daily playlists too. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ Edit: so I've come to the realization that I'd really love one more thing added. ðŸ¥² Please allow sound recording when screen recording in the app, just like YouTube Music. Would be a huge, huge one if you could do that.",1
Love it I connect it to my Xbox and get infinite skips and replays and just have to deal with adds because I don't have premium but in all honesty music is a way of life and this is a great way to listen to music.,1
"Great music selection kinda like Music Facebook ,only problem is it keeps freezing on the roku tv.",0
"Been using this app for years, used to be amazing. Recently it began to stop displaying the player controls on my home screen and in the app, and it also stops playing content regardless of what it is at random. Used to be a 5/5, now it is borderline unuseable. Will update my review when these issues are resolved.",0
All the music I need and it stays updated with the latest from the greatest,1
"Would like higher quality audio option (as promised last year), a Composer (not Artist) column with sorting capabilities, and more info. on each track, e.g., musicians and instruments played, producer, original year released, etc.",0
"So apparently you can't use your power save mode without the music cutting in and out, doesn't matter if online, offline, wifi or data. What a ridiculous problem that they can't fix, I don't recommend downloading the app or paying for the service they provide worst music app",0
"After an ad, I was told enjoy my 30 minutes of uninterrupted music. After 3 songs, an ad started playing. Each song was about 4 minutes, not 10.",0
Good and easy to use,1
"After the last update the app has been really buggy, it often won't register when I go back on a song and it just keeps on playing no matter how many times I hit the rewind button, it also often won't show what song is playing in the bottom of the screen, the only way to fiz it is to close the app and open it again. Pretty annoying.",0
"The one song I want to hear cannot playðŸ˜­ Even the album is no longer available ðŸ˜­can you please bring it backðŸ˜­it's Tuks Senganga- Monopoly album. The song name is Joko Ya Hao by Tuks, Lesego, Madok. Please!!!!",0
Overall great app but is missing some albums from artists.,0
"My fav app, I use it the most out of my all apps :) It's not perfect - no, I would have few recommendations how to make it better - but out of all music apps - it is the most accurate :)",1
Too much advertisement!! So sad,0
Recently the app has deleted ALL my saved and downloaded playlists and songs! It has reinstalled them at the most inconvenient times and then deleted them again by mornings! This keeps happening for the past month! Right now there is nothing in my playlists or saved favs. I pay premium as well and have had this app for years!!!! And am not happy about this. Please fix the bugs or roll back to previous way the service worked!!! I will change my rating if app works properly again!,0
The amount of ads are ridiculous. Good thing I can mute it till they're over. Also it's acting buggy lately,0
"This app not even deserves one star ,one of the worst app ever worst experience,whenever I try to login or create new acnt it showing something went wrong nd when its open then it says you have no internet connection,even though all other apps smoothly runs even YouTube ,I don't know what's wrong with this app ,if u not here to improve this app plz take this garbage down",0
w app wow,1
I have had great experience using Spotify Since I could not afford the subscriptions earlier I put on my opinion on reducing the amount in the survey and it was considered promptly which came to me as a surprise When I got the offer for subscription for a cheaper price I did not think twice and subscribed for an year Loved it PS - Spotify is the best advertising app when it comes to pushing people for subscriptions ,1
It doesn't working says run time exception many times I have deleted and reinstall it then also it's saying than useless app,0
Thanks to Spotify. I can access all my favourite music without using my phone storage,1
"I keep getting ads for 3 ""free"" premium months but when I click it then says I have to pay 5 euros for 3 months. Otherwise the app is not good for music listening because you can't choose songs to play among other things.",0
"Horrible customer service. Poor ethics and incompetent employees. After 4 years of asking Spotify to cancel my account, they are still charging my card and ignoring my requests. Amazon music and and pandora is just so much better.",0
Latest app updates are very slow and get stuck,0
Nice,1
"Overall it's a good app for playing music that you want to hear. If you can afford it, you should definately purchase premium. However you can still get away with the free version, but you will only be able to shuffle on mobile. To get the most of it, you also need to use it on other devices such as Google nest, Chromecast and PC. I wish I had lyrics on mobile, but currently I don't.",0
"Not bad, I can't find all the songs I want to listen to on it though",1
please stop addding song that are not in my playlist. Its so annoying to listen to a song not on your playlist when you want to listen to YOUR playlist not what Spotify wants. I wish there was a option i tried everything and Nothing worked so PLEASE make it an option!,0
App was fabtastic until most recent update,0
I thoroughly enjoy your music selections,1
No super awesome on android,0
Easy to install. Ready to listen to some good music,1
"If you're going to keep deleting JRE episodes, then I will be canceling my subscription. Joe is an important voice in today's silence or cancel culture. Please do not bend to a few big mouths. WE SUPPORT ROGAN!!",0
its great! As a old apple user this is better than apple music!,1
"Spotify is like hell, look whenever I search for my favorite songs or play my playlists it doesn't let me. The premium ad keeps showing up and only 6 times skips for songs when you shuffle play. How do I enjoy my day when these things keeps showing up? It's better on my tab cause I can play anything but phone neither Spotify is my problemðŸ˜• but listen I still love the app with a little disappointment.",0
"Mostly great, but if you must interrup make you commercials good. Not effin stupid and annoying.",1
Great,1
"The app itself is great, works fine, but I don't appreciate if the premium charge bounces, when you reprocess the payment and it automatically upgrades you from premium to the next more expensive plan (like single person to two) and you cannot access billing through the app. You have to access billing through the website only.",0
Seriously Spotify u don't have proper shuffling for multiple playlist in queue. I guess it's time'to move on from Spotify. Really awful.,0
So after the new update the app is still glitchy. It keeps on trying to play the music from my watch but my watch doesn't have a speaker. Can you provide a setting where we can choose if we want to use the phone or watch? I donâ€™t know why I choose to playback music from my phone but then after awhile it switches to the watch. Itâ€™s very annoying. I don't like how it automatically will switch between using the watch or the phone whenever i try to navigate the music. Fix the app it's still not good. Itâ€™s also draining the battery by 8% every 60 minutes. Their should be no battery drain when Iâ€™m not even using it!,0
"App plays random songs in your playlist and plays ""suggested songs"" even though you have more than 15 songs in your playlist. Skipping these songs brings up more ""suggested songs."" Without premium, this app is so useless I could go to YouTube and get more value.",0
spotify sessions are great except for the fact the music lags everytime you fix the queue or add a song to the queue. its so annoying please fix that. edit: the one abive still applies but now i have ANOTHER problem. i keep downloading playlist and it shows downloaded but isnt. its like im not even paying for the app lol. fix this.,0
My best part .. after 12 midnight me n my Spotify is best with expresso. I loving it ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜,1
"WHY THE HELL DOES IT KEEP ADDING SONGS, JUST LET ME LISTEN TO MY OWN SONGS! AND SO MANY ADDS. YOU HAVE TO PAY TO BASICALLY EVEN USE IT.",0
"New to this , but had a good time listening!",1
"Clearly, this is an amazing app qith the best quality, the only thing i dont pike is that they dont offer all songs, but mist every app has this situation or maybe a worse one. So please, go ditch ur pandora and join spotify, it ia so worth it.",1
The app keeps bugging. Please fix it,0
Most recent update is rubbish. Podcasts and music keep pausing mid stream for a second or so on a strong connection. The currently playing band is gone (who thought this was a good idea). Currently playing in the drop down is also wrong. Even the actually playing app has the play symbol implying it's paused. So many bugs for a paid service.,0
My clients absolutely love my Playlist that I provide through your app so they can listen to music while they are getting their hair done. They love the selections and quality of music that is provided thru spotify,1
I happy well for Spotify,1
I can't play the songs I want to listen to.,0
It always crashing down; unable to play and just stop working everytime I use it,0
"I,m enjoying myself listening to the love songs, it relaxes me.",1
"Doesn't work for me, I can get all the menus to load and I can select what I want to listen too but when I choose anything it just buffers and nothing plays. Really sucks to be honest.",0
"It's a great app and all, the music is good and you find what you want but the annoying thing is that when you search for a song you want to play and select it, it starts playing other songs that you did not even want to listen to and you have to wait for all thoooseeee songs to play, it's very annoying.... Please fix this, plus when you make a playlist it starts playing other songs that aren't in your playlist.... Please fix these issues, the are not making it user friendly enough",0
I am facing issues in Spotify from last 7 to 10 days When I play the song it's strat and I listen 5 to 10 miniute and automatically song stopped and I again open Spotify and play a song but than again this issue it is only playing 5 to 10 miniute and after that automatically turn off Please check this out it is problem in update or anything else,0
"I love it, all my music, when I want it.",1
Device optimization is a mixed bag... spotify thinks my tablet gets spotify premium for free but I cant run the app without it crashing on my phone... Thanks?,0
"Spotify had been extremely buggy lately, dropping out at random moments and requiring frequent resets in order to stay connected to devices",0
Why when I play on my phone can't I start any song I want not just a shuffle that starts on random song. Can start shuffle on song I prefer while on my PS5 so why not on my phone? You are still selling same commercial time no matter if I pick what song starts the list so what's the deal. Stopped using this bc 3 commercias in a row that one longer that YouTube and it's over 30 sec longer. Stop the trash and fix simple things.,0
"I have all my music download, yet anytime I try to listen offline. None of my music is there and rufuses to play anything unless I go back online.",0
Its like every other place you can listen to music but I do like that it shows where you are in the song on the lyrics,1
"Well, this application is very good and so on, but something started happening to me two hours ago, which is that the songs stop when they reach nine seconds. I deleted the application and re-downloaded it, but it is useless. Please give me a solution",0
"Whats up with music lagging now? On great, unencumbered wifi. As if the Bluetooth settings pop up wasn't enough of an annoyance!",0
"Love this app, makes my life so much easier as a high-school student. Being able to listen to anything whenever and wherever I want. Plus with the new lyrics to almost every song, I get to sing (out of tune) in the shower. Highly recommended for everyone!",1
Honestly used it for like 6 years and was great Ads are super annoying but you get used to it But recently its been crashing a lot and some of the new updates are kinda dumb But it still works well enough and I despise apple music so spotify it is,1
You can play from any device and can control from from any device. All devices are synced. Spotify recommendation algorithm is so good. Everything is great ðŸ‘. Ofcourse except subscription fee ðŸ˜…,1
Love the 60's music and Christian music. â¤ï¸ all Iisten to,1
"Won't play or search my music, yet my YouTube is working just fine. I just don't want to give YouTube my money anymore",0
It's cool haven't used it for long but it has to many ads,0
"Really convenient to create a playlist for a barbecue, dinner, etc. Love it",1
Ditched Pandora years ago and I regret nothing. The ability to customize and share a Playlist while getting the intuitive experience of having music (I ACTUALLY like) suggested makes it top tier. I've even gone on to purchase a family plan to spread that same feeling to my family. Thank you for supporting so many artist (some of them close friends of mine) on your platform.,1
Enjoy hearing the tunes. I dont recall seing any adverts but thats a good thingcas my concentration was looking to hear tunes .,1
Glitches to current song being played is persistent and annoying. AND I PAY FOR PREMIUM! * update still no changes.,0
"It was very good until recently, now it's started to shut down on it's own after a couple of hours and the shuffle option in your playlists is not working properly.Also it gets interupted if you are using the app on your phone conected to another device( tv, speakers) I hope it is just an update/ maintenance glich and not a permanent thing.",0
Spotify is my favorite app ever. I love it but I would recommend unlimited skips. That would make it even better. Other than that the app is amazing.ðŸ™‚,1
"Would have rated 5 stars but the amount of ads are very irritating and they pop up after every single song i hear. The quality, audio and the search engine is beyond the words. It is amazing but the advertisements washes it down. Hope the team would work on it!",0
The app itself offers the best user experience of music apps in my opinion and most likely has the largest library of music. The problem is the fact that Spotify Premium advertisements are pretty intrusive if you're on the free version and the ads between songs are quite annoying.,0
I cant change my playlists song soi want to give you 1 star,1
Sometimes the now playing bar goes away on mobile and comes back after you reinstall spotify I have a premium membership and still get ads this needs to stop,0
Can no longer preview a song.Bring back the feature,0
This app is most likely in play musicðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶,1
"I honestly don't care what people say about Spotify, I mean a lot of people now hate Spotify and rather listen to songs on YouTube instead. It's most likely because you have to skip songs just to listen to the song that you want, but like if you hate or don't like Spotify than you're just something else (impatient is what you are) any have a good day and don't go on TIKTOK. I'll leave a 5 star review on TIKTOK check bit out.",0
"The playing now bar disappears just as soon as a song is played in the background, the app needs to be closed from recent apps in order for it to appear shortly again before disappearing.",0
doesn't work at all anymore. the app won't even open.,0
I like using Spotify its just a nice app I also love the weekly discover section,1
"great music streaming platform, podcasts too!",1
"Spotify gives you any, and all music that there is to listen to absolutely free, and creates mixes based on the music that you listen to. I highly recommend this app to anybody who likes music.(Who doesn't like music?) This app also gives podcasts absolutely free that tell great stories if you like stories(Again, who doesn't like stories?) Did I mention that it was free?",1
"The latest update broke playback display. Not entirely sure what triggered it, but after a period without use, usually sitting in podcasts, when I start playing a song the song starts playing, but the app doesn't acknowledge it. The only fix I've found is closing the app (in the application viewer) and opening it again.",0
For free can't get much better. Thanks guys and gals at Spotify,0
Cannot play songs or albums i downloaded for offline use fix this please thank you,1
Cool that you can listen without internet!!!!,1
"Overpriced, price point almost trippled without adequate notice, will be unsubscribing.",0
Glitches and issues with new update. Irritating. Recorders on multiple different devices.,0
"I hate this app now like seriously after the new update it's all changed like I can't even repeat the song and it's all in a playlist and it all pissed me off I deleted this app and I'm using another apps to listen songs cuz who would like to pay for songs, there are more appsðŸ™„",0
I have been using this app for last few months and paid for a year subscription. But now after 3-4 months it's stopped to work and now I am not able to log in.,0
"I'm having trouble logging into the app. Even though my gmail and password is right, it doesn't log into my account. This is not the first time it's happening. Please fix this issue.",0
Just get rid of the Disney and all will be great for me and maybe more. I don't like hearing the same ads all the time. But you still get 5 stars.,1
Good music 100 ðŸ’¯ clear sound,1
Really don't like the racism that's going on with on some of the things that's on Spotify I am uninstalling and shall not use along with a lot of my friends have a good and blessed day Spotify bye,1
Spotify premium is the best.,1
"Not sure if it's my phone's fault or Spotify, but when listening on my Bluetooth headphones the streaming quality sometimes suffers. The ability to make and share playlists or collaborative playlists is one of my favorite features of the app.",0
What's not to love? Can find any band or artist I look up. I really like everything about this app.,1
Like this app forever but the ads are disturbing ðŸ˜ pls take the ads if anyone not have any money what he will do he can't pay any premium so do like that everyone is there nowadays so pls make my demand and Spotify 4ever,0
"i absolutely love this app, but it won't let me subscribe to a premium plan. i am a student discount beneficiary and everytime i try to subscribe through mobile payment, it only shows me the ""oops, something went wrong message."" i have tried troubleshooting several times but there has been no solution. i have been stuck trying to figure out this problem for a few days now. please fix this, i have been a premium subscriber for a year and this is the first that has ever happened to me.",0
Magnificent ðŸ’•. Best music streaming service.,1
Stops loading songs unless the screen is on. Which is resolved with a forced close. Starts playing song randomly in my pocket. Only resolved with a forced close. Stops responding to controls on Bluetooth. Across all Bluetooth devices. Only resolved with a forced close. I would say on average I have to force close the app 4-5 times a day. I've cleared cache and cookies and Uninstalled/ reinstalled and have the latest pixel os. Yet the issue persists.,0
"Exceptional application for online songs. I loved the option of merging the app with inter music player of samsung. Overall, application works flows less.",0
Overall love the app I use it every single day probably It can be buggy at times and takes a minute to load But usually theyre good at updating and fixing anything going on Lots of options to listen to and premium is really worth it in my opinion,1
I can't understand this app because I'm choice another song its come another song its making me mad plx update this app I can't be so relax with this stupid app,0
Love it! Still in early stages but easy to use!!,1
Listening to spotify has gotten me through my elsewhere my outside work mowing the lawn platinum flowers this is the most wonderful thing in the world. I love it.,1
Found many of the songs I like but there are still some songs and artists I can't find,1
"This app is amazing, Every song i needed was in it! Everytime getting bored,Woried and feel nostalgia this app help me alot! Khamsamida",1
"The layout and the player is good, but way too many ads. Like, a ridiculus amount of adsssssssss.",0
"Good service with many annoying bugs. The playback notification often breaks, the ""liked"" icons on songs are unreliable, the animations still aren't fluid, there is no friend activity in the mobile app, etc. Also, the desktop app is very laggy, slow, and unresponsive, the friend activity extremely unreliable and broken, Spotify sync often can't connect and is quite unreliable, connecting to Spotify sync and disconnecting again resets the volume of the desktop app, and every update worsens it.",0
"I used to really enjoy Spotify, but it's really gone down the drain in terms of both quality and enjoyment. I am also really disappointed in their commitment to misinformation.",0
Its a nice little app for music I only use it whilst I'm on pc or console but it works rather well on console pc version a bit finicky sometimes but overall its good,1
Would be 5 stars except for the new update that makes it always want to connect to Bluetooth which may have resulted in the fact it no longer works as perfectly (e.g. it randomly stops playing),0
I have used this application for years now even getting premium I would personally say its worth it all for the music,1
Cant stop app without restarting my android phone. Need an easier option.,0
"Always been very pleased with Spotify but the latest app version is a complete disaster - no play bar, stops playing after 10 mins etc. etc",0
I like the different genre and countries played on spotify.,1
Like seriously they don't even deserve half rating so many ads I really want to kill the people who are speaking in those ads plea spotify not everyone can have premium I swear to God even if I become a billonare I wont buy premium Let's see what you guys do for this stupid ads people are deleting spotify,0
Best app for music by far and for podcasts! Love it!,1
"As others have said, music just stops playing when screen locks on S20+ now. Definitely not battery settings.",0
"Nice apps, but too expensive to get the premium",0
"I held out from using this app for a long time but after some use I can honestly say, I wish I wouldn't have. Mainly here for Joe tbh. Can we get a commen section?",0
Need more improvement because as time is going it is getting worst n worst i have been Spotify user for long time but finally got better options as resso for good collection of songs and wink for best quality songs,0
App needing update as studdlently stops repeating songs and other times when music randomly stops,0
Great app obviously. Found it slow but then I moved all my downloads from my SD card to phone storage and now it runs just fine,1
"I love this app so much to be honest, tho paying 10$ for premium is a bit much and when i turn off my phone to listen to it same will the music sometimes but all and all i love this app so much its really great! :)",1
It always log out when my data depletes and always requires me to download the playlists i have already downloaded all over again. I'm done with this app!!,0
"Why can't I play the song I want? I did clicked on the song to play but it just changes to another song, How do I fix this?",0
"What went wrong Spotify? Why did it suddenly became like this? Why did it add songs and i can't delet them, they keep getting added by Spotify. Please fix that, thank you.",0
Spotify has been TERRIBLE lately. I can't go on to the app without it lagging out or closing app. When I actually am able to listen to music I am not able to add music to other playlists. I wish they could fix this.,0
Idk what you guys did with the interface but it feels like i have less control.,0
It's hard to figure out if you don't have tech knowledge.,0
Pretty good. No glitches so far. By far best music app I've tried so far.,1
It's not a bad app although the fact that you can not choose the song you wish to listen to kinda sucks. I don't really skip nor mind the ads but I want to be able to choose what I listen to not the have it on shuffle.,1
"As many have described here already, if you're an Android user there is no play bar unless you reboot your phone every time you use Spotify. I thought it was an issue with my phone but it appears endemic, which is a strange issue to have as it's a very basic error but affects enjoyment of the app massively.",0
"The now playing widget in the bottom left doesn't work. So, I cannot pause/play, skip, ff, nothing. I've reinstalled, I've updated. I have to close the app to stop whatever is playing.",0
I only listen to my favorite murder for entertainment and white noise for sleeping. They are both ðŸ‘,0
"Worst app I pay for. I have to delete it and re-install at least 3 to 4 times a week. It either stops playing after 10 minutes or won't stop playing. I have to open the phone and close the app. Then it starts playing when I get back in the car and won't stop when I get out of the car. I have to open the phone, open the app and delete the app.",0
"Tons of music, easy to use",1
Simply awesome. Quality of music is good. Best part is it's algorithm. Which u want to listen it just offers that in time. One thing to Spotify developers - pls enhance the music quality better than now. We want more quality. As of HD quality.,1
"I love being able to listen to my music, but lately I'll pick one of my playlists and it gets stuck on a black screen with the spinning green circle. Is this a glitch? I really want to listen to my music.",1
"Great app, but I should be able to skip as many times as I want and play whatever I want without have to pay for premium.",0
Can't imagine listening to music without Spotify anymore! Have discovered so many new artists thanks to the app,1
The best. But I do hope you guys create an light mode option for the ui,1
"Don't know why I keep coming back to Spotify Premium, probably because I spent hours finding music to add to my library. The random play feature is awful, it continually brings in the same artists. That's not the reason for the 1 star though. I'm using a new android phone but try to connect it to my Google home mini is impossible. The forums are out of date with solutions, refering to menus that no longer exist. Surely it's a simple thing to ensure connectivity is simple. It's an ongoing issue.",0
App is crashing on my vivo v23 phone how i have uninstalled it and then installed it again but no gain,0
Such a wonderful platform! No single music I like can't be found,1
"Great ap, that plays the music I want when I want that allows the screen to be off.",0
"Once again broken since the last update, this time the wrong music plays when first selecting a song.",0
"Superb App,Nice songs collection.",1
Stuck at logo and loading screen after I log out.,0
Best music and podcast app i ever seen...,1
"It's alright when it doesn't decide to bug out on me, stop playing what I'm listening to then go to a random cast. Or the video just going crazy which meh, could be better but not the worst",1
The app great and all you get any song at the swipe of a finger but my problem is why do the keep double charging me The first time I payed for premium plan three days later they charged me again i.e I pay double the amount a month which really sucks ðŸ˜ž This is the third time they doing it For now am gonna switch to free till they fix the problem If not I'm switching to other streaming service,0
Can you make a update I don't like when I press my like songs it's only like only like seconds are not minutes I just 1,0
It's getting really annoying how the shuffle button on my playlist doesn't actually play the songs in it. Can you fix this ðŸ˜ž,0
Overall experience is good my liked songs play from there playlist once finished i thought it would play the next song i liked.,1
"Love the service, using the app when i actually want to works flawlessly. but the app has 1 big issue for me. It tries to open spotify and play my local audio files when i open them outside the app. and is making it impossible to play them with the app installed. I have it set to not have permission for local files but it reads them anyways.",0
Can access all genres of music ðŸŽ¶ with Spotify.....,1
The play list created is fantastic. I really enjoy using Spotify,1
Feeling So good for listen her songs her ads posters vdos All good spotify team ,1
The library is great but its hard to ignore that spotify protects podcasters who are anti vax over the safety of their consumers .,1
Its better but i cant controll my playlist it pues songs i dont want,0
I know people always wonder about the music I listen to and why I listen to it well I'm pretty sure everybody's figured out by now every week not everybody understands the fingerprint no matter what it is not everybody understands that kind of print so every fingerprint is got its own distinct mark and that m a r k that part have a good day and well that is,1
Hands down the absolute best And only Music App you will ever need. Phenomenal at predicting more favorites for you to listen to ðŸ’¯ðŸ¤,1
Please return the pause button to the centre. The pause button on the left is really uncomfortable to use!!! Please fix this,0
Keeps spamming me with demands for Bluetooth permissions when I log in. It does not provide an option to permanently opt out. An app that does not respect me does not get respect from me.,0
I've been using Spotify for 3 years and i've never had a single problem with it. I would kinda want there to be a feature where i can see an album cover and it covers most of the screen so i can see it but that's not a problem just something i'd like lol,1
"Constantly pauses on its own, wont display song playing at the top or on the lock screen.. getting really frustrated.",0
"Wonderful app and great selection. The Discover Weekly Playlist always has great new content, introducing me to new artists. However, I wish there was a way to categorize artists I follow so I can easily play songs from new (to me) artists.",1
Better than Pandora which wont let me play what I want to hear.... Ever,1
"Love it. Every song I have ever searched for is on Spotify. Seem less song transitions, quality audio, great recommendations for audio I may like or podcasts. Would recommend to everyone.",0
Prefect app for music their may a big bug every once in a while but it's okay,1
AlLO,1
I've had Spotify for over 2 years and they've been great. Thanks Spotify!!!,1
Nice,1
For a few weeks now I've been unable to queue music and since I do that almost everytime I open the app its really been dragging the experience down. Also other bugs such as the Bar with the song currently playing disappearing.,0
"I have used the app for almost a year, still hard to navigate, clumsy and there is always something glitchy like it drops my Bluetooth connection or it won't keep you player controls up but will still play so I have to shut down the whole app. For how big spotify is the app as a whole is still b- quality which is sad. I am using Samsung 21.",0
Great selection! Great sound,1
Nice app for music but what really really annoying is it has so much advertisement the main point for the ad is Spotify premium it's really annoying in-between listening to music,0
Love spotify the best music app. â¤,1
my downloads keep disappearing and i cant play some of my downloaded playlists on offline mode,0
Been using Spotify since the beginning. I pray they continue to support free speech and to stand against cancel culture!,0
I love that I can choose songs to make a playlist (unlike Pandora),1
I cant even play my liked songs in the order I want anymore I don't know what's going on or if it's the new update but please fix this it is unacceptable that I can't search up a song and I play it but it plays a whole play list and not even the song I searched first! I don't know who thought it would be a good idea but it is a terrible idea.,0
"Great for creating your custom playlist, but Pandora has a bigger playlist repertoire. After a few likes, the daily mixes all become the same and it gets monotonous.",0
"Overall it is a great app for podcasts with copious amounts of content but problematic on my Chromebook. I have problems several times a day where it stops showing me what is playing in the left side panel, preventing me from interacting with the podcast in any way. The only way I can fix it is to go into settings and completely delete the app's storage then log back in. This of course wipes out anything I have downloaded. Unfortunate but prevents me from using the app as much as I would like.",0
This app is amazing  premium user Its incredible I can listen to all the music I want I can create a lot of playlists I can see stories of my favorite artists etc I totally love this app Maybe the price can be lower but thats the only problem I remember when I was a free user and the ads were a little annoying For those reasons I give 4 stars ,1
"Great when it works, haven't had too many issues on the Pixel 6 Pro. Control bar is missing with latest update",0
Super fantastic app,1
Need more options for speed play when listening to a pod cast. Google podcast has 1.3x play speed and many other options. Spotify only has 1.2 then 1.5. We need 1.3 it's the perfect speed to listen to podcasts.,1
"no functions for convenient listening (I can't even pick the concrete song in the playlist), no pluses at all, uncomfortable application",0
I really enjoy Spotify. They have a awesome selection of Music I like They are the bomb..,1
This latest version is terrible. Notifications don't open anywhere. Changing podcast speed causes it to skip back. It randomly crashes and also conflicts with the camera app.,0
I don't know when the last update was but I have a lot of issues with whatever is being played just suddenly stopping. The player itself looks different or won't even show what's playing. Something is weird.,0
"Like many others are experiencing..sooo many bugs. Paying for premium for many years now, but looking at canceling and trying another platform. SPOTIFY are you even interested in your customers feedback?.",0
"Extremely glitchy. Albums won't load, songs won't pause or play on command, songs/podcasts will stop when app closes, songs/podcasts won't stop when I pull my headphones out. Just been awful recently",0
My shuffle button doesn't work I've installed and deleted and installed several times and the problem persist. I have tried everything I could find to try on the internet and nothing changed.,0
After update premium not displaying play/pause bar. Having to force close app to resolve issue. If you start playing anything and come back to Spotify there is no way to restart the player. Also will play over videos and not auto pause. Post update. Before update was fine.,0
"Love this app, but I do not like that my playlist does not play randomly all the way through before repeating songs.",0
It is just fantastic to have such app if you are into music. The fact that it suggests music that you may be into is a bonus to discover new artists.,1
"This app suck, where is the download button and it play random music when I play the song I want to play not good for new user.",0
"The application functions well. The main concern is a push notification that cannot be turned off everytime I get into my vehicle that says ""going for a drive? Check out this content!"" This type of intrusion is not acceptable. Especially when it comes to driving.",0
"with premium, amazing!",1
It's a great music app. I enjoy listening to old school tunes on my phone. But still have a question. How does one get to play it offline?,0
Worst app ever can never skip back to your song and if you click play it continues with whatever it skipped to and that's stupid also u can only skip so much times worst app experience ever rating -100,0
It's good if you have money for premium. Lol.,1
I love the app the way you can connect it to any device is nice,1
"I just downloaded some podcast then after checking it, its goneðŸ”ª ðŸ™‚ THE FREAK SPOTIFY? ITS NOT FUNNY THATS ALMOST 30 PODCAST !!! I WANNA SCREAM ðŸ™‚ Offline Mode Sucks",0
"Hi SPOTIFY AB, This app is outstanding and remarkable. The audio quality is very nice. But the problem is, in many songs the lyrics are wrong. It's very uncomfortable. I hope it would be good if you say how to change the lyrics in songs. Thank you",0
"The best music app ever, you can blend your music with friends, that's awesome!!!",1
Nice app. Tho.. It deleted my entire playlist on update! Ndo nini sasa!!!,0
"Superb awesome music streaming App available in the whole world! Everything works flawlessly, UI is superb and it's dark feels so much better than other apps. I can listen to music and podcasts online/offline I just need canvas feature and 2FA authentication sign-in for this. Would be great.",1
"For the last two months I had more access to things in Spotify, but now it's changed and I kinda hate it now",0
Ads should not be allowed to be loud. Can't just pick a song a and listen to a song. Use YouTube instead.,0
I will only listen to JRE and nothing else because you have no spine to fight for free speech. Shameful. The app crashes a lot to making it almost useless without wifi,0
"Getting worse with every update. It used to be simple and functional, now the app takes forever to load, the UX isn't very good and bugs appear at random and stay for at least the next three versions. The bad quality control combined with the extremely small amount of money artists make with streaming is an absolute joke.",0
Cool and easy to use but you guys are rejecting my mastercard which i wanna use for subscription,0
Worst application.samsung duos phone is faster than Spotify,0
Spotify Music is great you can download offline it works better?,1
Monthly update breaks the podcast player but doesn't allow you to to stop the podcast. The ie the dashboard for the podcast doesn't appear at the bottom. Happening again just a month later after another update. And again this app is getting worse for Samsung users.... Right on que one month later,0
"This may be a good app until I wanted to play a song, a specific one to say. But it always shows a ""suggested"" song that I dont want and I cant even stand it anymore so please fix this cause all we want is some music.",0
"I've been a Spotify premium member for over 6 years. Won't ever use another music streaming service, and I love the features Spotify has to offer, as well as exclusive podcasts!",1
Long time user. Works very well. Good selection,1
A gem,1
I love me some Spotify. I've been using it for about the past 5-6 yrs!,1
"Premium is Best , plain is full of Add",1
"I will only rate 5 if you include option ""Set Music As"" Ringtone, Alarm Tone and Message Alert tone. Edit: I'm lowering my rating more because it's annoying that it doesn't have option to remove a certain song directly from my playlist. I still need to get out and find the song to remove it instead of it being available when you click the 3 dots.",0
"Great app, but leave the politics out of it. I don't need or care for you to give me a opinion on anything. I can research and find facts for myself. Stick to bringing music and podcasts unfiltered and unregulated.",0
Worst app Full of ads They just want we irritate from ads and take premium.,0
"Terrible! When screen is locked, favourite button is so close to back button, that i keep hitting it by accident and loosing fav songs.",0
Spotify loses connection to my Google Home speaker group way too easily so I'm always having to restart the connection and stream. It's not my wireless inside the house but maybe jitter latency on my internet signal that is rural cell tower hotspot based BUT Spotify should have a mechanism to expand buffering to prevent these temporary connection interruptions.,0
Best platform for Best old songs I like it.,1
Everything great other than the equalizer menu should be accessible on the homepage snd the app has some bad optimization or something because it opens super slow.,0
Bro this junk is trash bc you can't listen to anything it only let you like it or something like that and it just sucks like I would even listen to this if it was the last thing on earth period,0
"Had to reinstall the app as it won't let me download songs, I'm on premium. Now the new installation won't even open. Nothing but issues ever since it updated. Please fix.",0
only down side is that u cant download music offline,0
Do they have 10 year olds programming for them? Every update gets worse and worse and worse. Completely unusable junk. Here's a tip for the developers.. if it's not broken stop trying to fix it.,0
The best music platform. Absolutely astonishing. Would recommend to others,1
Great app but been having Pro problems lately. If you skip ahead about three songs it stops changing the song details. Meaning you have to go off and on again. Happens on my P20 Pro and s7 edge also.,0
Like... when im playing certain songs they play but when I try to play another certain song it plays another song!!!! Why is it like that!??!?!?!??!?!,0
I love their recommendation and playslist made for me^^,1
My my what can I say about Spotify I used all my cool apps with these bands,1
"The developer to this app is starting to become very liberal, it is not playing artists that most people like. I've been using this app for over 7 years. I am also having technical glitches on it playing on my car. I may have to go back to using Pandora",0
"Exceptional. Been With Spotify For Years. Love That They Don't Up Their Charges Once You Subscribe To Premium. As A Musician & A Person That Treats Music Like It's A My Pulse. Spotify Gets Invested In Their Subscribers, Whether It's From ""Summer Rewind"",""Most Listened To Artist"" To ""A Quick Mix Of Songs You Forgot"". 5 Stars & Highly Recommended.",1
Works well across devices and connects easily.,1
"Since connecting to spotify I have found the program and the choice of music to be excellent. I would certainly like to move to premium, But unfortunately being an age pensioner makes it rather difficult. Perhaps spotify could consider a discount for age pensioners similar to that of the student discount. Only a suggestion. Once again thanks again for providing an excellent source of entertainment.",0
"I honestly dislike the update, the app is confusing and it was better before now it's just a mess, I'm not able to actually pick what song it plays it's just random and the playlists don't show the song pictures just the names, and I'm not able to pick what one plays because of that.",0
Getting really tired of all the issues. Have to reinstall to see what song is playing or edit playlists. Sometimes will only play one song then stops. Songs have been getting stuck/ skipping. Really not practical atthe minute. Used to be good though,0
Stop adding songs to my playlist,0
I love these app very much good audio quality thank you play store and Spotify ðŸ˜,1
one star is ok,1
To difficult to turn app off. Considering uninstalling,0
"It's been a long time for me to heard anykind of song from this app(spotify), especially for korean pop song. Then suddenly, after my latest update for the released new version this app having overflow lacks for it's sytem. As instance: when i still play onto my music, the song stopped out of the blue despite my provider is stable plus there's no disruption either,and other lack in some feature which likely to much for me to write it all here. For world's sake, please develop it beter odeveloper",0
Is a cool app you can enjoy music offline.Which make it nice for users that don't have data.,1
Always says ur offline even when high speed internet is on... Foolish app,0
"Okay so I've been trying to play some music but I doesn't work and plays a random song. It all started when I was in my like list and I was trying to play a song but a different song would be playing instead of the song I wanted. I made a new account and the same thing happened so now I can't listen to the music I want to hear, instead some random song that isn't even in my likes. I was trying to play the song 'Misery Meat"" but, it didn't work and a random song appeared.Please fix this I hate it",0
"This is awesome,but there are no lyrics of some songs so,I rate it 4",0
Great selection of music and the ability to quickly create your own playlist that can be public or private.,1
"Garbage update... can't get thru a song without it cutting out or even showing what song is playing... closed the app then rebooted it and went to play different song and still can't physically see what song is playing, closed the app entirely and song will still play in the background without the app being up or on the lock screen...",0
Very good music experience ðŸ‘ŒðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ,1
"Keeps bugging out, tried reinstalling several times and I know it not my phone as this is the only app I'm having issues with. If they manage to stop messing up the app with each update then I would recommend it, but I can't in the state it's in now.",0
"Accidentally tapped on the ""hide Song"" feature in this unintuitive mess of an app, had to navigate through the menu to even see the song to unhide it and it still doesn't play. And Apparently the few minutes on Android take seniority over years of desktop use because I literally can't reverse it on my PC without it saying I have to do that via the Android app.",0
the genre filtration is broken again,0
Awesome.good experience.only one problem that for some songs lyrics are not available.,0
This had become my main music app. Ive been showered in all the great things Spotify offers and I love it.,1
"Been using Spotify for 8 years now, and I swear it knows be better than I know myself some days. Best streaming service out there, and I recommend it to anyone who needs a premium music streaming subscription",1
I've used Spotify for years and I definitely recommend it to everyone because whever you're there for songs or podcasts it has everything and it is very engaging with how it creates playlists of songs new and old that you've listened to. 5 stars you should download now.,1
Best of the best music app,1
"Really well thought out design, only problem I get is not being able to pick a song every so often otherwise, works fabulously!",1
"The app is great and all but the service is bad. There's no Dolby Atmos, no Loseless, no HiFi. There's nothing about this service that is better compared to other applications. I'm only using this app cause it has better app all devices.",0
"This app is amazing. I once had premium and the service with premium was fantastic. Now I'll just need to save some money to get premium again. I love how they have the lyrics time synced with the songs. One small issue though, sometimes the lyrics are wrong or they show they show the music symbol for a solo part of a song to early or late. Other than that the app is great overall. I don't like the adds with the free service though. They're all terrible.",1
"Luv Spotify&the offering of podcasts,stories&even language classes,not just music! I have playlists for my child's bedtime that work great.I just wish it was a bit easier to navigate the home page.When you open it,it's always a bunch of gobbledegook showing alot of the same stuff it always shows,mostly just popular mainstream stuff.It rarely seems to recognize what you like to listen to and then doesn't always show much variety of your kinda music when it does recognize it.Still luv it tho.",0
Brilliant music app better then amazon music well worth the money,1
it keeps saying that I'm offline even though my connection is stable.,0
Good app only downside really is the ads but I've come to accept it,1
It is amazing app for listening all songs,1
I absolutely love that I can listen to any Genre from any generation,1
"I love Spotify, it's so much better than any app I've used for podcasts. I'm so hooked I can't get enough. It helps when I'm at work and want to keep my mind going. I love to listen but have difficulties reading. So this definitely helps out getting to understand the moment with more details. Thank you so much Spotify.",1
It's a really good music app and Injoy it alot and it always has new music every week for u to listen to.,1
Forever glitchy. App play button and current song playing disappears and i have to constantly restart the app. This app has a great track record of poor updates.,0
"Wonderful on PC, not so much on mobile, otherwise I would have given five stars.",1
Awesome & amazing experience.Love the app.,1
"i keep experiencing one bug or the other with this app. one day it's that half my downloaded playlist dissapears, another day I can't go online even when I'm connected to WiFi. and I always update, it just updates to a new bug. please fix up.",0
Very pleased with Spotify so far,1
Decent player so far only been using it a short while on free all good so far !,1
Can't even play the music of your choice in mobiles. You have to skip through dozens of musics even if you have created a playlist of your own.,0
Other music apps have an offline feature where it allows you to download some certain music for free but it's otherwise here .,0
Keeps saying go online to search when connected via mobile data. There's no way to refresh.,0
A very solid user interface.,1
So many glitches now. Have to close app to get it to stop playing as there is no ui to pause or play. Going w YouTube music instead,0
Having a LOT of issues with the app just stopping all if a sudden. This has been since I made a family account.,0
Please stop adding songs to my playlists I can't stand half the artists you shove down my throat. I can't even block creators from showing up. I find a small playlist specifically for a band and then every indie rock artist crams their way into it.,0
LOVE,1
Had a couple of adds pop up while listening to music two weeks ago. Strange.,1
Very nice to listen to music through Spotify,1
Ad free app really awesome music app ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
It's okay but it shoves premium in your face and you need premium to do a lot of things,0
The app sometimes doesn't play my music & I have to close the app & reopen it. It also sometimes skips over like 1 or 2 seconds of my song or podcast,0
"For some reason, since the beginning of April, occasionally the player won't sync up with the app and while I can select items to play, it won't let me open up the player so I can see my queue, pause, skip, etc. I don't know what is causing this bug but I hope it will be fixed soon as it makes the app very difficult to use.",0
It was so good untill i couldnt play my music,1
I've already canceled my premium but your app won't let me do anything because because it wants me to make a payment instead.,0
"Very quick and easy to use, can listen to music anywhere I go through my mobile.",1
I mean sure it's alright yk easy to use ads are annoying tho,0
I love Spotify ðŸ’ and it's just the best it has every song ðŸ’ðŸ’ðŸ’ðŸ’I love itðŸ’,1
"Free listeners get about a minute and a half of ads every two songs. It's crazy excessive. And you're forced to listen to you're playlist on shuffle. You can't pick what song you want to listen to, or listen to your playlist straight through. I know they want you to buy Spotify Premium, but ruining the free experience is not the way to do it",0
When i wanna listen to a song it just play another song,0
Good,1
My favourite app. The perfect one. Love you Spotify ðŸ’œ,1
Awesome I love the music sound,1
Great helps with sleeping on the bus,1
Just love it and the playlists are awesome.,1
Have been using this since 2018 and till now spotify is still good and I love it so if u are seeing this legit im not lying u should download it as it is really good u have skip songs in 6 times in a day and I think I good as i brought premium it working fund no ads all good :) <3,1
"I have Spotify Premium and Spotify STILL takes the liberty of shuffling artists songs. I cant just listen to an artists top songs, I have to remember to disable shuffle EVERY. TIME! It's obnoxious and in no universe should this be a default setting when I'm literally PAYING YOU MONEY NOT TO HAVE TO SHUFFLE EVERYTHING!!! TURN. IT. OFF.",0
I love having Spotify it's absolutely amazing.,1
After the update it pauses randomly and when playing a song there is no playback bar.,0
Love how easy it is to find my favorite music.,1
I've been using Spotify for Abt as long as I've been able to use it so far back and they treat their old custys wit this disrespect making us watch 10 ads in a row when we were the ppl that made their app big and now they can't slide a 1 year free of sum primeum like I see how it is once you get big you forget Abt all the ppl that made you get their,0
Overall it was very good but like at least in playlists make it like premium,1
Good but ads ðŸ–•,1
It keeps crashing everytime I play a song. Not even a second is spared.,0
"It's not just good, it improves permanently offering new super options. I love it",1
Expensive... and if you have 2 devices they make sure you pay 2 seperate memberships. ...also there is a glitch where you shut down the app and it continues in the background anyway until you restart your device.,0
Music ,1
Why the music transpose change while I hear one music with earphone????? It always transpose up/down every seconds but only that one song and one moment.,0
Absolute rubbish. It adds rubbish to your playlist and doesn't actually play any of your music.,0
"The app that I can Never Get enough of the music app by Spotify it will blow your mind how they will play the kind of music that I like to l listen to, and plus you can follow them on Facebook if that's your thing, plus if you got the extra money premium is the way to go because it's a contributing play without the annoying commercials. It's my top pick of apps. Thanks.",1
Can't live without it. Very user friendly,0
"I really enjoy this app, however from time to time I experience a bug where i click to play a song and it plays, but the mini player never shows up so I can't pause, skip the song or change where I'm at in the song. Restarting the app fixes it sometimes but it's pretty annoying. Other than that I've been using this app for years and I recommend it to anyone looking for a single place to keep their music",1
Too many bugs on my phone,0
Best app for songs..because u can listen than u can also make playlist..,1
Is it really so difficult to make a music app that works? After so many years you would expect it to work flawlessly. Bravo ever single software engineer working at Spotify...,0
"Use to really enjoy Spotify, but as of recent it's randomly been pausing/buffering while playing even for music I was download.",0
Why my spotfiy when i ply a song it will knock me out to home screen its so ignoring tho i bought subscription and it wont let use it,0
"I can't play just one song, it forces me to play an entire playlist. This app is just too complicated",0
"I am on premium for over a year now. Recently, my offline downloads aren't playing. Its been downloaded but it won't play and just says there's no internet connection. So bad because I'm paying for premium but I'm not getting the right service.",0
"30 minutes of uniterrupted music is a lie. I get 3 ads after each song plays on an album. I have cleared cache and data, removed and reloaded app, logged out and back in with no fixing this problem.",0
Does not update automatically,0
Very good app easy to use great variety of music ðŸŽ¶ I listen to my music all day.,1
The only reason I have Spotify is to watch the Joe Rogan experience. It's a pretty great platform though. I used to listen to it on my PlayStation 4. It's a good app. Not what I prefer for music but if my first choice wasn't available I believe I would be listening to Spotify everyday,1
"Still Great! The new changes, and improvements you have made are stellar. Thank you for continuing to work so hard, to make all the music available, available to all the people. Jam On!!",1
"Latest update not working at all! Please take us back to the previous version! Playlists ""not available"", intermissions every song, current song doesn't appear in the bottom... playbar/controls are gone, won't work well with car bluetooth, won't work well with Waze... total nightmare, please, please fix it ðŸ™ =(",0
Love it,1
The music quality and variety and accessibility is amazing.,1
Ads are getting more and more annoying,0
Awesome overall. But it happens a lot when they say enjoy the next 30min of add free listening but then I get adds in that time.,1
"Everytime my phone restarts or shuts down everything I ve downloaded dissappears and I have to download them again and again every time.. I use SD Card storage and not the phone's storage. (Galaxy s20 ultra) Please fix this :( despite this, Spotify is my favourite app, no problems, excellent app!",0
I love it but I don't like that u can't skip songs without paying for premium:( :),1
I was an amazing experience to hear songs from Spotify. But you could make a feature to download songs it will help us to hear our favourite songs in offline too. But i am satisfied by this app.,1
"Good selection, not so good app.",0
"As with most things they just want your money, and they keep sending suggestions on music etc which if I wanted I would have asked for....not great, so unless you want to pay and be annoyed I'd try another site.",0
Best app for music everrrrr,1
"It's an amazing experience to have majority songs on a music platform - online and offline both! However, it would be great if Spotify could take suggestions for missing songs, which users would like to be made available.",1
"It does this thing where while I'm in the middle of the song, the song will just stop, Spotify will close and the song restarts it's not my headphones bc I have 2, it's not the same song, it's the app. I updated it but it still does it.",0
Good app. Had fun hearing songs but the ad makes it really worse.,0
love love this app!!! i listen to podcast a lot and it is good to use!ðŸ¥°,1
"Spotify is better than Amazon Prime. It has a large amount of options from music, podcasts, and books. There are very few searches I have made that came up empty. It is less expensive than Amazon Prime with more to give.",0
At first this app will show ads only every 30 min that was ok .But now after every song this app shows 2 ads more than 30 or 45 seconds and that is very frustrating .Although this app is very good for song because it is easy to use,0
Not working with wifi networks,0
Wow,1
This app is going down hill is so bugged and beyond annoying to deal with...,0
Great for the most part. Can be repetitive and many commercial breaks if not purchasing any monthly service plans. Beggars can't be choosers ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸,0
Love Spotify Any song any time from wherever you want to be Spotify is the best,1
I would like to have garth brooks added to the collection of songs as well as some others just to expand the library,1
Enjoyed the excellent service,1
Spotify has been crashing on me and won't show me the song bar. The song itself won't turn color either.,0
Great app very cool easy to use and has every song would use 100%,1
The best music streaming app on the planet.,1
"Travelling down the same path as YouTube, started out great but is now full of bugs and censorship.",0
The best music app I have ever seen,1
"This is way out of line. Ur ads R too much ! I feel lyk unistalling it now. If yall reading dis (spotify) plz despite da absurd amount of ads fr those non-premium customers, atleast make it according to choice not region. If its about premium, fine but when it comes to song ads please give ads related to our choice of song or frm those we follow not from the region who pay most. We are ur customers and i belive we should be your priorities. Plz take this into consideration. Im out of space now.",0
very good spotify application ,1
"Does whatever it wants, it's easily the worst of the apps similar to it. It turns podcasts on or off at will and changes the podcast mid episode and loses its place which can be annoying to go back and track down where you left off. All this especially since 99% of the time I'm using the app while driving. Not a fan but I got a prompt to review the app so here it is.",0
"User unfriendly and poor sound quality. I can't scroll back in a song. I can't skip to the previous song if I want to hear it again. For example, I added Dream Theater. I just want to listen to Images and Words from the beginning to the end of the album. Sometimes I want the album in a loop. Don't go mixing stuff randomly. If I want something else, I'll click another album. YouTube has better sound quality and allows me to skip. Just wanted a playlist for long drives.",0
"Force closes too often, can't report problems because that force closes too",0
Way too many ads at this point I listen to more ads than music,0
I can't see folders containing playlists on Galaxy watch because folders are not shown,0
Nice,1
It'd be nice if you could organize your music by decade like 50s-2000s in your playlist etc. But just a suggestion. . .,0
"Really well developt app, easy 5 star rating. Sometimes, after the update, app forgets log in details, so I need to put them manually. Edit: app crashes constantly.",0
App going downhill recently. Too many bugs in S22 Ultra. Notification shade gone. When it's there the buttons don't work. Doesn't even show the right song. Will play music and need to be force closed... Now playing panel is gone from the bottom of the app when browsing music etc. No bueno...,0
"I logged out of my Spotify account to log in too my friends for a brief second, but as soon as I logged out Spotify has been broken. I've been met with nothing but a grey screen with the Spotify logo. I closed in and out. I waited over night, still didn't work. This morning I deleted it then re-downloaded it. AND IT STILL ISN'T WORKING??",0
Countless music selection and very good sound quality,1
"Only the worst programmers work at spotify. I Only pay to listen to (*J*.R*.\E) until they're forced to kick Joe. Use podcast addict for everything else. Just buy music you like ON CD, use the ~25 year old ""app"": Winamp, to listen to one of millions of internet radio stations, free. The blue warnings mean it's a really good episode and they're right over the target. ""Never give up. Never surrender"" - Tim the tool man Taylor",1
Best music quality among music apps. Stunning experience.,1
My playlist doesn't working. After first song of the playlist another random song start playing .,0
This app always closes due to its shutdown. I can't play any song. When it updates it works.,0
Annoying popup about giving the app permission to control nearby devices with Bluetooth whenever it starts. There seems to be no way to permanently dismiss this nagging if you just want to listen to music. On the upside the player is way less janky than the web player.,0
Struggle to connect with amazon echo auto,0
First time using...love the music selection and ease of using the site. Nice job guys. Thanks.,1
Super but high mb can take please change this best app in world,1
"I've been a long time user of spotify and love the amount and quality of music I can use, but recently it's like I'm paying for nothing. Everytime I try to load my downloaded songs I have to close the app a couple times before it will load. I pay to have the ability to listen offline and am not getting that.",0
"The premium is definitely worth it! Quite inexpensive as well for students :) P.S. Very disappointed that the preview songs option while creating a playlist is removed. Just why would you do that! It was so good, now it sucks! If the changes are reverted back in a month or so consider me unsubscribed. It's not like there are no alternatives! Please fix it! Else you risk losing a lot of your listeners for sure...",0
"Overall a good app, it can glitch from time to time but it's not a waste of money",1
"Spotify has been getting more and more unstable in each update. Now, it often won't show me what song I'm playing at the bottom of the screen, making impossible to pause, skip forward or backward 15 seconds or interact with it in any way. Also, the songs will stop playing randomly for no reason at all (not an internet problem. It also happens with downloaded songs). The former problem usually happens after the app has been in background for a while, not playing anything",0
Currently the navigation bar is missing when playing content. Unable to pause etc.,0
I love having every song I want when I want premium rocks but a commercial or two isn't bad cuzz there short.,1
Found my favorite podcast through a spotify recommendation. Foerever grateful,1
"Outta words , just the best app I've ever used for music..âœ¨",1
It's ok but it's so annoying that u can only skip a couple times,0
"Excellent. No faults experienced. Had some great stuff suggested. Only niggle is adverts, particularly for music, tend to be totally irrelevant. But I can tolerate it as the price for free listening.",0
I love this app and listening to all my favorite songs but what i dont like is all the adds like omg i literally only get to listen to 2 songs the i get hit with 6 ADDS!!! Like i get 2 or 3 but 6??? Ridiculous...but other then that i love it but pls shorten the amount of adds my gosh,0
Very annoying appðŸ˜’. Anytime I want to play a particular song it doesn't play it for me instead bit plays other songs..I just don't get it ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦... Shuffle play is the most useless feature I've seen on a music appðŸ¤¦. If you're making the app free then why the rubbish shuffle playðŸ¤¦... There are other ways to advice people to pay for the premium package not shuffle play. If you want to do that then just eat the app ...ðŸ˜’ðŸ¤¦,0
Great app you have made I have a request that you remove prime user in Spotify Or gave us free,1
"No music controls (skip, play, pause etc) and music cuts out for a few seconds on each song. No longer seamlessly connects to android auto. Latest update has been a downgrade and I am a premium member. Good music choice when it works",1
"I don't know if I'm doing anything wrong but I can't seem to listen to the songs I want to listen to. Doesn't matter if I've made a playlist or not, when I click the play button it plays every song except for the one I want.",0
"Can't really find the song/music you are looking for, some of the suggested title are as good as junk. Limited search result for some song/music. Can't find the original song sing by the artist etc etc Try searching this song/music in Final Fantasy 4, (tsuki no akari/theme of love) or ""Say Yes"" by Chage&Aska the result disappointed me. The autoplay track is not useful, i keep getting msuic that is not similar to what i am listening. Have to turn this function OFF.",0
"Great app. Makes it very easy to find and track songs, artists or playlists. Also, I love the option to download songs for offline listening. Very appreciated feature.",1
"There is some issue with the app, I can't able to play songs, the playlist is not opening it is continuously loading and by clicking the song is not being played. I request you to repair the problems at the earliest. Thank you.",0
I really like this app because it is fast and free when downloading music.,1
Not working properly,0
"Good overall, but the block artist option doesn't seem to always work (new releases and collaborations) and doesn't seem available for podcasts. The option to remove undesirable content would obviously improve the user experience. I've been finding myself switching to other platforms to avoid getting annoyed.",0
This app used to be great but in like the past year it's gotten to where it doesn't load. Even songs that are downloaded won't load if you don't have internet connection. I don't understand why I'm paying such a high fee n can't have my music and podcast,0
Increase audio quality then you get 5 stars,1
"It's nice to listen to, but when I'm listening to my playlist of like 30+ songs, I get suggestions. I HAVE SUGGESTIONS OFF! I've searched how to fix this, but all I see is thing saying to fix one of these two things, that I have fixed. I just want to listen to MY music! Edit: I just got five straight minutes of ads, and the rating dropped its last star Update, now Im getting songs Ive ALREADY HIDDEN in my LIKED songs",0
Nice song very good quality,1
Joined because of joe Rogan but also like music selection,1
"Canceled my subscription spotify,, you chose the wrong guy. Never again will I use your music app again.",0
"I can't go more than two songs without the app crashing. The app also loves to not start playing songs, remove downloaded songs, tell me there's no internet connection, and not actually skip songs when I swipe. Unacceptable for a paid service.",0
I hate the fact that I cant skip my music after six times(or even less)and the fact that I can't even go back either which is very annoying and the ads or unbearable at times(like I would get 5 in a row)and sometimes it wouldn't even play my music it would play some other random music that's not apart of my playing and why would I have to pay to skip my music a unlimited amount of times that's super stupid and I'm thinking about deleting the app,0
Amazing experience for me! Just wish it was cheaper!,1
Inappropriate adds. It played when I diconect from a blue tooth device on my phone as well as for some reason always says it's connected to something every 30 min you'll get a notification saying spotify trying to open then it will say spoify connected to a unkown device super sus,0
For some reason I have to finish the song that I am listening to be able to change it (if it's in my likes songs list),1
"Love the app, absolutely amazing. I just wish the the Destiny 2 Witch Queen soundtrack was available to my region.",1
"There is an annoying bug where I play a song and when I leave the app, it'll skip the song. Has been doing this for the past 6 year and no fix",0
"Changed my rating from 5 stars because the most recently update has totally screwed up the app. Doesn't show the music actually playing so I can't pause or skip, and doesn't show in my notification tab either. I have to close down the whole app and open back up again. Sometimes it just crashes altogether. What am I paying Â£10 a month for?",0
"This is absolutely horrible! I'll just stick to Youtube. Everything was going fine until an update. I can't even play the songs that I want. My playlist no longer feels like mine. I can't play the songs that I want and I can't even skip them, what's worst is the ads are so long. The app was perfect until everything suddenly changed. I am deleting this, I'll stick to Youtube.",0
"Very buggy on Galaxy S22. After playing something, the play band/navigation doesn't show up and thus can't switch output devices.",0
Best curated playlists,1
"Maybe spend more time finding and fixing the bugs in your code, and less time making silly playlists for my pets who don't really care about what I play.",0
The app started crashing constantly on galaxy S10. Stops playing music randomly. Does not show up in the slide down menu occasionally. The app used to work fine.,0
Love the new features haven't really had time to check all of it out. Maybe a video to help us navigate all these new features. Excellent. I'm staying with your service. Keep it up.,1
"I've had spotify premium for years with very few issues. However, over the last few months the Spotify app on android has become awful. The play bar constantly disappears and all customer support say is to download the app again or wait for an update that is permanently 'just days away.'",0
Garbage absolute garbage if it's been multiple hours it should have give you more than six skips and yet again it doesn't let you pick a specific song from your playlist to play,0
Very nice,1
"Is just awesome, can't live without my Spotify.",1
"I love using Spotify. It could do with an update of music content in its music library. Upload more songs and albums please of genres like anime, metal and many more that I dont see when open the search tab. I see songs and albums of many artists removed of what you once had. I once spoke about this in length on your live chat. PLEASE HEAR ME OUT ON I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT! THANK YOU.",1
There are just too many ads. its more like listening to ads than songs. we cant even listen to 2 songs continuously because of the ads. and i'm from north india giving me tamil ads makes no sense. there are other music apps too which we can switch to and are ad free and that'll make spotify users lesser. frequency and amount of ads should be reduced. overall the songs and quality is nice but ads ruin the experience.,0
The update makes everything bad. I liked spotify a lot but now??,0
"Limited function on Samsung phones. For over a week the play and other control buttons are not visible inside the app. There is no way to control the music or change the songs, and the app intermittently stops or pauses the music. A company of this scale with an app costing this much needs to do better. No music for over a week",0
"The app is great, I've used others, and for me, Spotify just works, knows how to talk to us, and has a really great experience. And for those who are complaining about sometimes your downloaded things don't load when you lose connection, you just simply have to turn of your internet connection ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘",1
"It is good, helpful for me. But every single time I want to extend my premium access, I always have a problem with it. It always says ""Something error"" and I have to access it via laptop/web. It's not practical. When I am away and didn't bring my laptop, I have to wait to reach home to extend my premium access. Could you please help me? Thank you so much.",0
"One of the best apps ever! I love how easy it is to use Spotify and how easily accessible it is to find my music, as well as new music. The system that recommends music based on the music you listen is very good, as I am constantly finding new music that I now love.",1
Spotify premium is the best I have used this service for years with no problems I recommend it to everyone who enjoys listening to what they like,1
"Works OK - I have premium account and tried adding additional payment method and the account crashed, then had to reinstall it. When I reset password it took 24 hours to receive the email, very frustrating. App has started to not show what song is currently playing Mar 22.",0
"I never had the time to listen to Spotify because of my busy schedule, now I have been listening to your program and found out I was missing a great deal of wonderful entertainment, I will continue listening for a while and later I will subscribe to your premium level.",0
Very very nice app but sometime adds come so that is irritating ðŸ˜,0
Highly reliable and entertaining...,1
While using the premium it is always as superb,1
Best,1
Sometimes the playlist dornot opens and then again I have to download it or maybe update again after the given update.,0
I listen to it every day. Lots of options for us podcast junkies,0
"Very spotty servers, laggy mobile and desktop apps that crash and hang with no explaination despite top tier hardware. Catalog shrinking due to political and copywrite nonsense.",0
"The playlists aren't that good. Plus there's some problem, i can't find my last played or last searched songs. Seems the list doesn't update",0
"""Playing from suggested songs"" WHY!? I TURNED THAT SETTING OFF. Also, your rubbish at picking music for me, stop putting shut music on my play lists! - It's rude.",0
Very Good Nice Music but I want to know how am I Download the music in my mobile. Thank you,1
I just love music and it's easy to understand how to use this app!,1
VERRY GOOD,1
"Their algorithm for music is so good, very cool selections of music. My only wish is for us to be able to hide the people we follow and also have more features to allow access to playlists to certain followers of our choosing.",1
Love this app! Must have for every music lover out there :-),1
"I love using spotify, I say its better than any other music app. One thing I do hate is that has happen, whenever I'm adding songs to a playlist or just looking at songs i cant play a preview of the song. I used to be able to but now I cant. Very werid and it would be nice to have the ability back. I looked it up and what I have seen, it's a update with spotify that took the ability off. It would be so much better if it would be put back on though, but anyways I still love using the app!!!!!!!!!",0
"6 ads in a row? Going back to YouTube, why would i give you guys 10$ a month after you aggravate me like that? Uninstalled",0
"Too many ads ruined it, although it says watch next ad to have 30 mins free, but it shows 3 ads in one go and can't even last 3 songs before next ad shows up",0
doesn't seem to be working properly off late. The controls disappear and I have to kill the app in order to stop the music from playing. Randomly stops playing songs as well until I reopen the app.,0
No problems Immediate quality music Unlimited options of genre,1
Why do i need premium to download music I might as well just listen to download music on youtube ðŸ‘‹,0
"I love Spotify! When using it on a computer, you can skip and play any song. I have countless playlists, and those generated by Spotify are spot-on. I have discovered countless music and playlists. It makes work, gym, and everyday life just that much better! Thanks, Spotify!",1
"Latest update killed the app. It's buggy, it doesn't play songs, it closes after one tap. Please fix.",0
Very satisfied!! Absolutely love the selection of cd and song and artist.,1
It plays songs that I don't have on my list but other than that it's great,1
There is a lot of advertising,0
Can find good music on here,1
"This issue has been resolved and Spotify; now plays, the correct album material... When you search for John Mellencamp's New Album â€Strictly a One-Eyed Jack"" It comes up and when you hit the â–¶ï¸ button... Spotify plays Pink House, from his Uh-0h Album...",1
I love this app so much. If anyone love to listen music so he or she can download this app. I just love it so I gave it 5 stars. Just try this app. We can make play list and give it name and can listen music anytime anywhere. Download this app. And tell about this app to everyone if they like to listen music. Everything is available Punjabi song Marathi song Telugu song and more.Nice appðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ’“ðŸ’“ðŸ’“. Listen songs everywhere listen song. Balle balle o shava shava piyo piyo Kawa Kawa. Dance ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜,1
This app keeps changing all of my Playlists and wont let me play certain songs witch is annoying,1
"Love the quality of music, and the features are so comfortable that I always use only Spotify to listen musicðŸ’œ The premium plans are easily accessible and of reasonable price. I Love Spotify â£ï¸",1
It's the best app in the store. Couldn't live without it.,1
I mainly listen to fanf or songs to make stuff with and this is just the place!,1
Very Epic music app I love how I can be listening to music and on another app at the same time. Epicness!!!,1
"The app is great, however, I've had some issues lately with it. The app sometimes crashes. I ask to play a music, the timer goes on but it doesn't play any sound. I'm not the only one that complains about it since some of my friends decided to stop using the newest version of Spotify (they had to download a older apk from the web) in order to have spotify working perfectly. These are two issues that, in my opinion, need to be fixed as soon as possible.",0
"Love it, just wish there were fewer advertisements",0
"ads, often repeating three times in a row..abusive to force you to pay up",0
I literally love this app and I have premium but it keeps pausing at random times and unliking songs. And I cleared the cache and it still is doing it,1
I enjoy ancient history and Spotify has it in spades!,1
They support Joe Rogan with his podcasts. Boo. Delete Spotify. Plus the adds are annoying. Amazon prime for your podcasts and music is add free and most excellent as a corporate citizen.,1
Although it is a nyc app for listening music but now a days it is creating a difficulties...is shows that I m offline nd ask me to recheck the mobile connection even when I m online ...when I Uninstalled it I made it reinstall nd now I am not able to login ðŸ™ƒ,0
"Simply horrible, many log in failures and can't even find a way to un-subscibe ...will have to dispute to end it",0
"It's kinda weird on when I was trying to listen to a long Playlist it was like ""YoU fOUnd A pReMeIUM FeatUre"" and didn't tell me what the freaking feature was. And when I clicked it again it just said it again with not even playing it. I'm going back to YouTube.",0
"I love the lyrics feature, the automatic Playlist creation per song feature and, my discover weekly Playlist. Xoxo",1
Very good to pass the time and to learn some songs :),1
It was quite good in the begning  But now there are much ads and now the music cant be change and ads cant be skip,1
One of many apps nowadays that actually get worse with time,0
"Easy to use, easy to set up. Great songs from back in the day.",1
Best music platform,1
"Quite cool and interesting,so far good I can recommend other funs to install it",1
Best streaming app I've used. I love the personalized playlists more than anything. It's a great service.,1
"Good range of music, but too many adds",0
I love it its great I dont have any complaints,1
"It is given that this is indeed one of the best app to listen online.. But the problem is when offline.. I downloaded the songs already in order for me to listen to it while i dont have internet (workplace dont have internet). The problem is sometimes may dowloaded songs wont play. Also, the menu to add queue wont work.. Work this out please.. Thanks",0
"It's good overall, premium is cool but it spams me day in day out that I need to pay for premium even though I have. I'll change it once I figure that out.",0
"Spotify in its original format was great, even with ads...but, then...they began gradually increasing ad breaks, limiting free functions, interfering with my personal song playlists by using my analytic info to INEXPLICABLY overreach my custom playlists by adding, altering, deleting, or ignoring my numerous attempts at reco be erinh",0
won't play songs at all sometimes and freezes sometimes when you open the app,0
COOL,1
App does not seem to work on Samsung Galaxy A50! Cannot search for music. App crashes if I attempt to add a song to a Playlist and cannot see Playlist after adding songs on the web. No option appears to play songs either. I have deleted and reinstalled the app several times and have logged out and back in several times. I have done everything that I know to reduce background apps running and ensure wifi signal strength. Simply put your app is not compatible with my phone.,0
Spotify has everything I want and more.,1
Please make available all songs that are available in USA. Even some indian regional songs are not available in India but are available in USA. Not giving 4 star for that reason only. BTW this is the best music app.,1
"Honestly, the persistent bugs and playback issues I've been experiencing for more than a month have got me wondering why I don't switch to Tidal, especially considering how much better the artists are treated. Infuriatingly, Spotify has claimed that this issue was ""solved,"" but my experience continues to be a waste of money, even after this ""solution."" In conclusion, goodbye Spotify!",0
After having some issues when I first joined Spotify the app has definitely improved and now me and my family enjoy all the Spotify has to offer,1
Best song app,1
Since the new update im not able to like and unlike songs. PLEASE FIX THE ISSUE !!,0
Cool apps music,1
Good,1
Fabulous ,1
"It must be a joke to you guys to continue to have us have issues with your app. I'm so close to deleting this to solve my problem with the app and go elsewhere! Why will the ""see more"" text tab not take me to the list of songs in any album I specifically want to listen to!?... I keep tapping it and it takes me nowhere. It's annoying and the fact y'all won't fix these issues among others really isn't worth having it on my phone. Bye!ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼",0
"My account doesn't have access to lyrics feature, everything is awesome in this app except this one :)",0
Since the last update it stops mid song or pod for no reason if my phone closes Fix it please i cant listen even on my walks I pay for premium service & this is ridiculous,0
I always have Spotify music on while gardening.,1
"Awesome app to listen ur favorite music,songs and podcasts I'm giving 5 stars because it helped me to be happy anytime everyday everywhere in any device. It's easy to use and I didn't buyed premium u can get more features if u got that. Thank u very much tobthe developers and team for providing this app. :)",1
"Works great but now there's an issue where the status bar won't go up in the search tab, obscuring a part of the search bar when typing.",0
App closes at least 3 4 times in 40 minutes. Unable to enjoy songs even for 30 min,0
"Excellent, Our whole (6) family have a package we all love it, and we use it every day. Thank you.",1
"Was doing great, until it deleted one of my playlist. And of course it happens to be the one I use for class everyday. Ugh more extra work. Thanks Spotify!",1
"This application is awesome. This app is good, it does not even drink much data. I listen to Spotify everyday and it sounds good. Good quality music. I havenâ€™t even used the premium but it is good.",1
"App doesn't perform well, but I like the layout and the features",1
Kicked me out mid podcast while I was on offline mode. Then wouldn't let me sign in because I was in offline mode... tried sending me an email but doesn't affect the app... plus with all the new covid tags on podcasts probably just going to cancel Spotify and go to an alternative platform.,0
Alway find the Music I want to Listen to!!!,1
"App randomly downloads again my offline music onto my encrypted SD card. It happens weekly, monthly sometimes daily. It downloads 800, 3000, sometimes like today only 50 songs. Weird. Spotify support can not help.",0
"You all should download this, One of the best music app to be in your phone It's worth it",1
Good application but not sow lyricsplz do something,1
"As of the past week it's bugging a lot. I don't see the bar at the bottom of the page. I am unable to pause, stop or do any other functions. Driving me crazy. Technians please fix this issue ASAP.",0
I am experiencing crash in applications again and again,0
I can't lie. It's getting better and it's safer than their competitor. When it hits 5 I'll let you know,1
I can listen to all songs even the very local ones in my area,1
"Very confusing and slow to use, stops playing music randomly and doesn't automatically shuffle similar songs. Poor experience.",0
"Nice app have all songs you want,i enjoy music here just don't want that premium adds in middle of playlist.",0
LOVE,1
Haven't used in over 3 years. Paying off Joe Rogan was the push I needed to end my relationship with Spotify.,0
"Used to be amazing, now the apps keeps getting worse: often no ""currently playing"" notification, randomly stops playing, says I'm not playing music when I am, etc. I also hate the non-descriptive updates. What do you mean ""we're always making updates and improvements""? I only notice the app getting worse.",0
"Really enjoying this app. Love the fact that the podcast and streaming are in the same place, but it would be lovely to have high resolution music and 360 audio in the future.",1
Not sure how to work this app music,0
Love this versatile option for exploring and enjoying my music choices,1
"Best that has happened to me, now I can go anywhere and have my favorite songsðŸ–’",1
Worst chrome book app that exists. It keeps shutting down by itself. Uninstalling and then installing again does not work! Fix this please!,0
Great music platform!,1
i have premium but if you don't have it the ads are way too many and way too often.,0
"Would be 5 starts but lately has been very buggy and not functioning properly, music stops randomly or doesn't show what's currently playing, sometimes settings act up, been disconnected when connected to other devices.",0
Decent on terms of info about artist but why can't I have an option to view all of an artist's music in a list? Every other music streaming app I have allows this but for Spotify your choice is either viewing albums or a small list of top songs.,0
FACTS I used to love this app NOW due to this PREMIUM THING I cant listen to my songs as for how I wish to and facts now after using 6 skips in hour  when i click on the song I want to play it plays a complete different song are you SERIOUS,1
New update. New issue. My main playlist just completely disappeared from the mobile app. I can see it on desktop or web but not mobile.,0
You will find truly amazing music of all genre as well as the podcasts of today's most influential hosts with many interesting topics!,1
Absoluetly love Spotify always my go to for music or podcasts Ive been using it since it came out and ive never been disappointed,1
So far so good... I wish i can auto play the next song tho..,1
Overall a great music app. My only issue is the hassle one have to go through just to download a song. It should be a single tap process but spoti6makes it longer than it needs to be.,0
"I am giving the 3 month free trial a go and so far I am very impressed. Easy to use interface on the PC and on my phone but most importantly the Spotify display on Android Auto on my car screen is brilliant and easy to navigate. All my playlists are shown, plus there are Spotify playlists to try. There is also a functional browse option to use. The downside is that the Google Assistant voice commands are extremely hit and miss which is a big negative when using on Android Auto in the car. When I ask for one of my own playlists to play Google rarely gets it right and plays something completely different even though I have linked Spotify to Google on my phone and made Spotify my default music app. I donâ€™t have any such problem when I ask my Amazon Echo speakers to play my own playlists from Spotify. They get it right almost every time so I doubt that itâ€™s Spotify that is the problem. I have made a Google search and it seams that other Spotify users have been having the same problem for some time. It seams that the Amazon Echo prioritises your own playlists so it finds them easier whereas Google Assistance doesnâ€™t. Hope this gets fixed at some time.",0
Very good app but needs premium to get rid of ads,0
"Hands Down, best music app. Playes what your thinking about. Super easy search and library. Can't do without on a daily basis.",1
I enjoy the wide variety of music & podcasts that Spotify offers. There's truly something for everyone!,1
4.5 It is better than YouTube music for multiple reasons first you can listen to your music with your phone being off with no premium and there is like no adds ever without premium so it is already better than YouTube music,1
"The overall experience isn't bad, but certain bugs make it frustrating to use at times, like (a) long podcasts cause the app to crash, the audio usually stops around the hour mark (b) Offline support is not great, at times when my device is offline I can't access downloaded content (music/podcasts).",0
The greatest music stream app,1
"So annoying, these adds ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€",0
"Seriously, what is going on with this app lately? It either crashes or I have to force close the app in order to get it to stop playing. First time ever having to deal with this issue. Will edit review back to positive rating once these issues are resolved by the developers",0
Absolutely love music being there for me 24/7 every tone for every mood. Exceptional product. As a person who always hid behind music soothing my epilepsy. It keeps me sain xxxxxxxxx,1
The perfect music app Without adds in premium,0
Is good but make it to be eble to search every thing and downloade,1
"Stops all the time, and the song radio stations really are terrible.... never alike music...",0
I love how when you put in a certain artist it gives you a list of songs in the same genre. Really makes it easier to look up songs and hear new ones you've never heard before ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
Awesome all types of music at ur finger tips..,1
like that,1
"Absolutely unacceptable how many hours I've wasted making playlists only to have them revert to a previous form. Silicon Valley either needs to start paying taxes so we can have functioning infrastructure again, or at least recognize not everyone sits on an OC-768 all day. Truly pathetic and obvious sync issue, should never happen.",0
Nice music and best experience ðŸ‘Œ,1
As always!!! Spotify has a spectrum of music to satisfy any person's mood's,1
Wooo now it showing the features but some song are still unplayable why?and those songs are playable in other apps .,0
"A wonderful experience,spotify gives any song I want and it's perfect.",1
"The app posts pro-US war propaganda in something called the ""information hub"" telling me to support the US military and allies. I used to live in a refugee building with people who had families killed and homes destroyed by the US, including children. I think it's stupid for a music app to support violence and jingoism.",0
"Not a frequent user of Spotify. Have dipped in and out in the past. But will stick around for good. Thanks for inviting me to return, Spotify. Looking forward to explore the variety of musical choices. They say 'variety is the spice of life' and if 'music be the food of love play on'.",1
"The newest update is the saddest. How can you put the play button on extreme left? & put prev and next button in such close proximity. Change is design is good but this doesn't make any sense guys. Being a designer myself, my thumb shivers everytime I see that screen. Please go back to normal. Even interms of whatsoever ergonomics, those 3 key things (play/pause, prev, next) together are a disaster. Pls switch back to the previous design. Bring the play button to the centre. Pls Spotify peeps.",0
Love Spotify!!! They always have everything I need to hear when I need to hear it!!!,1
"I love this app! It's good for good jams and It's amazing just in generally. Though I have One problems. Whenever I play my playlist, A random song comes up which Is not in my playlist!! It's very annoying! I hope it's a bug! Though I wouldn't recommend this enough!",1
If you don't take premium the app will say you will get 30min of unintrupted music and after 2song the ad will come and this is the worst app i have use of all musicðŸŽ¶ apps. Pls don't install this app the worst app every ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡,0
100% has everything!,1
"Follows good 'ol microsoft patterns. More updates, the more stuff breaks. This app used to work amazingly, then tons of stuff stops functioning as time goes on.",0
Best app ever,1
"I like the app so much , but the fact that I cant choose the song I want from my playlist is so painfull , and you can even imagine how painfull it is ... and now I am thinking to transform to another platform to play my music .",0
You can't select songs and the app just shuffles the song. Need a premium to do that. Back then you still can select songs and skip for 6 times per hour. Capitalism at the shittest. The worst update.,0
"Lagging,not showing songs lyrics",0
"It says that it can play all my favourote podcasts, but it appears to be censornig them independently. Well I'm independently censornig apps like this from reaching my phone. Canceled prem sub and all.",0
Fantastic app and well worth the cost of going ad free!,1
Slow app opening and crash of music player notification in android 12 mi10tpro,0
I wish Spotify offered high resolution audio like Amazon Music and Tidal.,0
I love my Spotify,1
I don't have any lyrics. Fix this right away.,0
Excellent musical choices!,1
"I love the feeling of listening to a weekly mix of seemingly random but strangely appealing music in the morning. The music on this app has done me more good than I can tell. Only ""but"" is, its ads have gotten a little more frequent lately, and it cuts off the beauty of transitioning from one song to the next, one too many times",0
Something is wrong with the app. Keep having to close it in order to get the player to show up. Music playing but no way to control it. Not a good issue.,0
Awesome experience Clear playlist and Songs,1
This app is amazing and it is frickin free I'm listening to a song while doing this review and I'm already in love with it butttt... Just let me listen to the songs l want not shuffle play pls but other than that it's amazing ðŸ¤©ðŸ˜,1
Nice collection. Pl. Gujarati songs also.,1
Currently the best music service I've found. Company might struggle with public image and controversy but the music and app are great.,1
"Have discovered so much new music since joining Spotify, without a doubt my favourite app.",1
"I used to like Spotify quite a lot, and even paid for premium when I was often in spotty reception areas. Currently I'm using the free version - which was okay when it was a couple of ads every half hour. Now it's more like TV - 2-3 ads every 2 or 3 songs. They cut in part way through songs too and the last half hour has been so irritating that although I could be free by subscribing again I don't want to reward the changes they've made by doing this. Big thumbs down guys, I might just uninstall",0
Best music streaming application,1
Love that you can go back and listen to any song that pass. Also the lyrics is nice to read along with.,1
Amazing! Works great.,1
MAKE THE NAVIGATION BAR TRANSPARENT & ADD ROUNDED CORNERS TO COVER ARTS OF SONGS JUST LIKE YOU DO WITH PODCASTS. THE GRADIENT ON NOW PLAYING SHOULD LOOK LIKE THE ONE ON iOS.,0
"Most of the time it's an awesome app. Great music and podcasts. Occasionally, more often now than before, the option to pause, skip, or play disappears and you have to restart the app or your phone to be able to stop/pause/skip the song or podcasts",0
Love everything about Spotify,1
The app is good actually. The only problem is the ads are too much. I hope you look into this matter. Not everyone can or wants to get the premium pack. Thank you,0
i cant listen to the music preview how am i supposed to add it to my playlist?,0
I've loved aspotify for years and loved it. No nothing works properly. Deleted cache uninstalled /reinstalled Multiple times. Now it won't even download. Too many recent problems with the app over the last 12 mo. To list nothing works anymore.,0
NICE,1
Very annoying when i dont even get to pick what songs i want to listen to when i want to even in my own liked playlist. Change it please,0
Bro fix the goddamn bug. I cant listen to the song preview and the play button isnt there its literally broken,0
It's a good app if you want to listen to music and have 4 adds after every 2 songs,1
"UPDATE: Bug fixed. | If you playing some song in one of artist single (obviously this album only contain one song), then set the sleep timer to *End of track* after the end of song it doesn't stop playing, instead keep playing conflicted with autoplay feature. Please fix ! Xiaomi Mi A2, Android 9 last patch",0
Gave me two 20 sec advertisement and two 30 sec advertisement,0
"It's a beautiful app easy to use, and can find all the musical instruments I love",1
"I joined because y'all stood behind JRE, now I'm cancelling because of the mass ep. deletions. I'm not looking to listen to government approved propaganda.",0
"This app is great! But recently when i go to add new songs to a playlist i cant press on the song to hear it, only add it, can you please fix this because this issue is getting annoying!",0
I use this like for 3 years no problem it's super fun and cool experience and now the update come my Spotify keep shutting down every time i play i hope you make up for this .. now I'm using your Spotify lite because of that reason i try everything possible to fix but nothing happen,0
Spotify is the best streaming service there is. You can download playlists play songs over and over again or choose them all for free. My favourite part is the fact that you can create your own music. I like how you can follow artists so that you get notified when they drop a song. Spotify is smart enough to suggest songs you would like based of your listening and what artists you follow. At the end of the year Spotify reviews your listening with wrapped. This is a fun look back at your year.,1
I pay for this and still get ads. It was good until all my podcasts got ads.,1
"The playbar goes missing after a while, and it's annoying. The company is aware of this issue for some days, but still hasn't fixed it.",0
"App simply doesn't work alot of the time, when it does work it's glitchy, unintuitive, and inundated with invasive ads.",0
"People, just use Spotify Premium if you have so much problem with ads.",0
Where it's bugged so bad nothing is allowed to play on my Spotify on my phone so their goes my 3000 songs,0
"They added the feature to hide undesired episodes from your home screen on the cellphone, which was really good. But the feature isn't on Playstation Devices. Those frustrating ""recommended"" episodes still appear on my home screen!!! I've tried turning on Restricted Mode and hiding them from my cellphone but they're still on my home screen when I log in to the app from my PS4. It's so frustrating!!! I didn't even listen to podcasts and they recommended me 18+ stuff that I definitely don't want!",0
I liked spotify but there is one issue in it you can download in premium account but the drawback is you need to download whole album rather than a song of one's choice.,0
I tried so hard to play music in spotify but it doesn't work :(,0
"Can't open the full lyrics, always crash. Please fix it, thx!",0
"It's very helpful to me, Thanks for everything Spotify......",1
"Later edit: Ok, this was fixed, after some updates.Please leave the + and - buttons near each other, in my list (library) for adding/removing proposed songs. Also it would be nice we could have some filters or a way to arrange the songs in the created lists",0
You claim 30 minutes uninterrupted music if I hear 3 commercials or whatever but every damn time it's 15 minutes then 4 ads. Bogus bro .,0
'Now playing' menu keeps disappearing... Not functional.,0
"Didn't know Spotify was soooooo good Has all songs K-pop, Bollywood, Hollywood Like literally all I'm lovin' itðŸ˜ðŸ˜",0
Yeah since I renewed my premium its been buffering. Constantly. The momment my screen turns off it doesn't run. I turn it on and it kicks on for part of the song then turns off like its buffering. I open the app and its running the song at like 5 minutes. When its a 3 minute song.,0
It just stops all the time now. There used to be a banner at the bottom of what's being played so you can rewind or fast forward and its gone now. It won't let you listen to the next episode of the podcast on several different ones. What changed? It sucks now.,0
The new version doesn't display the 'now playing' bar which is really annoying. Can you fix?,0
The app is trash. It was getting on my nerves. I wanted to play a song and i clicked on it like a 100 times and tried to play it but it kept on playing some other song due to its own suggestion and shuffle feature. I uninstalled it.,0
"The hell is this? I can only skip songs 6 times in an hour and I can't see individual songs? They're all just in playlists and all in shuffle, my friend said Spotify is good but it's basically unusable for me.",0
I give it a four because I don't like how long the adds are sometimes and I don't like that I can't pick my music when I run out of premium,0
"The lyrics match up, (unlike apple music) It's nice having 1 month free, even then premiums worth the money.",1
This app refuses to allow me to subscribe for premium and I have tried everything. Customer care is also absolutely useless. They shouldn't be in business if they have no intention to make money imo.,0
"The app crashes now after the update. It now removes the song that I was playing but I can change to a different song but doesn't highlight in green. What was that for??? Totally uncalled for especially that I pay for Spotify premium. Really don't like the new changes at all. FIX IT IMMEDIATELY!!! **Edit**: The update is alot better, 4 stars!!",0
"Was my preferred music app until it started using all my mobile data to update and download my songs, that were supposed to only be downloaded via wifi. I double checked settings, mobile data was set to off but still 2GB used unnecessarily.",0
Love it,1
Get Spotify because they have almost everything you're probably listening too. I really recommend getting Spotify premium because their are no adds you can download songs and you have unlimited skips. Overall a really amazing app.,1
Too many ads like gawd I know I have to pay for premium you don't need to give me three 30 seconds long ads continuously Even once is enough,0
"I've been using Spotify Premium for a long time and it's been great so far, but there is a really annoying issue that I've sure other users have experienced. I have songs on Local Files on my PC. Well, all the time when I visit those playlists with Local Files songs, one or more songs randomly get greyed out/undownloaded. I try to download again, but later the same issue occurs again, and on random playlists. I love Spotify, but I hate this annoying issue and nobody knows why it occurs.",0
Easy to navigate and has all my favourite music,1
This app so great but Add is coming again and again just after 2 song Why so many adds plz do something,1
"I love spotify. It is really nice, and i love the picks for my songs.",1
"I used to LOVE the app but now all my downloaded songs are u downloaded and I had to download them again BUT I can't I tried several times but it just won't download again so I tried downloading other songs abd again no luck! I have premium so I can't say sth about skipping and stuff but I think that since the last hupdate Spotify is just ðŸ’©. It's lagging 24/7, and I can't even listen to music offline cuz it just won't play. Please fix those issues Spotify!!",0
Love this App...i was stoked when it was applied to the xbox platform,1
It doesn't allow me to log in it says im abroad and shouldn't change my location even after i do so it doesn't allow me in i will change jt when when it start working,0
It kept on switching from my favorite song to an unknown playlist that I don't like listening to. I want for you to please make an update that allows people to their favorite songs without having to switch to another playlist just because the favorite songs playlist is playing a song that is irrelevant to the songs that they have as favorites.,0
"If you're not a subscriber, you can't GO BACK and relisten to your favourite track(s). It's stupid. Even YouTube is free for replays. And the adverts don't need to be so LOUD ðŸ”Š it's bothersome.",0
Good experience for music,1
"Terrible app, barely functions",0
Every update makes this app progressively worse. They've just deprecated the ability to preview songs. This is a core function of building a play list. Maybe spend less on Joe rogan and more on basic UX,0
Stops or pauses randomly. Very buggy atm,0
I don't know why I can't see artist followers it's not showing any numbers please Spotify fix this.,0
Philistine,1
Very much I,1
Great app best music streaming app out there does everything I want at a great price .,1
It's a grate app but the only problem is that when ever I watch an ad and play the song and go for gameplay the song stops and the app crashes plz fix this problem,0
It never lags and there are no ads I love it 5 out of 5,1
Ive been reporting about lisa's money song having a problem since 4/24 but spotify seems to just overlook it. Please do something about it. The app is good but the problem/concerns that fans experience on your app like the app suddenly stop/music stop and issue with an artist song being replace/infringe and spotify slow action are making the experience of the paid app not so fun. Gonna change my rating if u address the issue.,0
"The player keeps disappearing, must uninstall and reinstall to see",0
"Awful app and user experience. App constantly deletes my downloaded music (this has been an issue for about a decade as you'll see from googling), says I'm in offline mode when I'm not and thus won't let me search for music, won't let me play downloaded music that it hasn't yet deleted, takes about 5 seconds to load downloaded music, etc. Constantly plagued with issues no matter what device I use (I've tried it on 3 smart phones and 3 desktops). Your developers need to get a grip and wake up.",0
I spoke with customer service for hours about an issue I was having and the final conclusion was that the issue was with my phone model. If you have issues that are specific to a device you should clearly market it as such if you aren't going to fix it.,0
Too many advertisements,0
"I love listening music on Spotify, it's really a great app for music listeners.ðŸ˜‡ðŸ’•",1
Excellent app! You can make your own playlist of your favorite singer!,1
The app has become way too glitchy. Its slow to open and the play button/search disappears requiring restarting the app. Not good enough for a paid subscription app. Might be time to move to an alternative.,0
Undoubtedly the best music app. I experienced bug sometimes in UI hope it will fix by next updates.,1
Basic repeat mode not available it sucks worst experience...everytime I have to add song to the playlist Amazon Music Is Way More Better Period,0
Awesome,1
Welcome to the ad app,1
Best ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘ and amazing music ðŸŽ¶ apps ever,1
Enjoy no commercials..love how it keeps track of what I play and makes me Playlists..,1
This is just an awesome app to listen songs but you should give an advantage of downloading songs without premium.,0
"Disappears on Android Auto often. Spotify trying to be too helpful on making the app easier to use, it is actually a backwards step.",0
My Spotify is not working for more than 2 weeks . When I am going to any playlist it's say the playlist Is empty and in the liked songs section it's saying something is wrong,0
It's been 2 weeks that the app is glitching and stops playing songs/podcast randomly. You go back to the app and shows nothing is playing but the sound keeps playing out. I'm force to restart the app constantly and I even reinstalled the app again just in case it was my phone but there is not changes.,0
"Literal dumpster fire, gets worse every update.",0
Best music streaming app out there,1
Having lots of crashes and pauses for no reason. I've had other issues with getting the app to work in Android car play as well. It goes completely unresponsive and I have to kill the app on my phone to get it responsive again.,0
Fantastic app of music but when i click on a song some other song start's up why? Fix this issue please,0
Why do you keep adding amazing features and then removing them?? I just don't understand.,0
If you don't have premium u can't even skip songs. They do anything for money. Not everyones rich some people just want to listen to music. Also they just put any song in your playlist. You can't even click a song it just plays the playlist however it wants. Disappointing for a app that is so popular and is supposed to be good. I'm deleting this.,0
"This is the best music app that I have ever used. You deserve 5 stars. New songs that I don't know I listen to, and I can play a song in the mood, or environment that i am in. It's really cool. You deserve the best.",1
App just crashed. Crashed again,0
"Spotify is another corporate scam. They figured out an efficient way to steal profits from artists. CEO says artists need to learn to produce more regular content to make more than beans. Well I got news for you slick, that's not how art works you piggish hack. Spotify is trash, delete it.",0
"Look no further, being interested in some rather obscure musicians! I have not been let down yet. Try it . I didn't find anything that compares . And as a bonus you have access too some great podcast. Be Kind in these trying times ! It cost nothing ,Rock On!",0
I â¤ï¸ this app. I get to listen to different singer songs !,1
"If you're having an issue with Spotify not connecting to internet on data, log out of Spotify, restart your device and log back in. This was recommended to me by the Spotify support and fixed my issue. It also fixed an issue where the Spotify website wouldn't load.",0
A excellent app...free music and podcasts !!,1
"Everytime I try to play a song on here lately, it crashes my phone. When it does play, seems to be using more battery too. Is this from last update? If so how do I roll it back?",0
"The app opens by itself and when I exit the app after I finish using it, it would open again and carrying on playing the song. Can you sort this issues out please",0
"Very good and easy anytime, anywhere.",1
Thanks for making me hate you,1
"Can you please add a button in podcast where we can download all the audios. Because we have to do it manually each audio podcast! And also, why is that I cant listen to a song I haven't downloaded when I'm using my data?! When I'm on premium! Please fix this and I will give you 5 stars.",1
i cant play my favorite song because its playing different song fix this!!!!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,0
"Amazing, my husband and I upgraded and we so love Spotify, tried all the rest and this is our favorite",1
"Edited 09/05/22: I don't know what's happened, it's now not so great. I feel sad that it's gone downhill and ripped off artists! Absolutely fantastic! Extensive library of music from the weird and wonderful I like to the old school jazz my dad likes. We get the family package, very pleased.",1
"Doesn't practice their own rules. Not OK to allow your ""star"" to spread misinformation but block others for the same reasons. Do better.",0
"I've had Spotify Premium for 5 yrs 3 of which not by choice. I'm a Grandma and not tech savvy. I switched phones and e mail 3 yrs ago and after 2yrs had forgotten my login. I couldn't access my Spotify account by verification through either therefore couldn't change them or cancel autopay. Calling by phone is NOT an option. Thrilled to say Spotify sent message today UPDATE payment method. Same card, five years, funds available! I am finally free of them!!",0
Super sound quality i love the all songs and this app,1
I love Spotify works great and $10 a month for premium isn't to bad either I'd recommend it for sure,1
Constantly crashing when I try to listen to any podcast. Music works fine.,1
"The App is easy to use, the algorithm also sorts out your song preferences very well. Its GUI is also pretty impressive. The premium version is top notch perfect",1
Sometimes the app does not show the currently played music on screen. I tried restarting the app several times but that didn't fix it either. Had to clear the app's data to fix it,0
Good experience with app has good music library being updated everyday.,1
"For years I used to love me some Spotify. Now it's infuriating. I can't even control to the point where I can't even skip songs, go back, choose playlists. It says I'm offline when I'm sitting next to my high speed router. I'm uninstalling and reinstalling now. Not optimistic. Update: All good, problem solved",0
The app will not open to the log in page,0
Excellent service good listening,1
i love it i listin to music everywhere even ask you what type of songs you want,1
"(NO STAR!) I have canceled my premium acct & they kept charging me, I had to report my credit card lost & they sent me an email stating they're having a problem charging my account so I replied that's because I canceled you a month ago!. I called my credit card to dispute the charge & had Spotify blocked! Google search Spotify & you'll see many people having the same problem. They won't give you a confirmation number or an email confirming that you have canceled your account.Law suit pending?",0
When I select an album it plays 2 maybe 3 songs from the album then switches to radio based on album. If I put an album on its because I want to listen to THAT album not random stuff that sounds kinda similar,0
I love the music butâ¹I hate the ads,0
Spotify is one of the best choices for music that I can think of. I had premium for a year and that was really great cause I was able to make-up some fantastic playlists. And they don't erase them when you go back to free.,1
Not sure if it's Spotify or Google's pushed updates but I've been prompted to update 3 times in just as many days. Not really amused with this. Also noticed that there's not much of an update log to incentivize/provide logic to users to update.,0
"Love Spotify. I've been a longtime user. But right now the app is barely worth 2 stars. I don't know if this is because of this latest update, or what, but it has been bugging out MAJORLY. I have to shut down the app and re-open it almost every second time I want to change a song. It's brutal.",0
I used this and it was the best app for music,1
The Android wrapper is garbage. Extremely glitchy from time to time even though my updates are turned on. Main issue is that I cannot see what song/podcast is playing (so now I am stuck at 1.5 x speed on Stevie Wonder--a setting I used for listening to podcasts).,0
Wow with song is nice too ,1
"Love this app. But only listen 1-2x week, 1-2hrs. Price is high for me.",1
"If I were to compare, Spotify is the best music app for me. I love the interface sm! Although there are some bugs and stuffs, they didn't hinder me much from having a good experience in this app. I hope you'd add more songs and improve the sound quality just like AM (it's already good but I don't think it would hurt if you make it better hehe)",1
"Everything of the app is fine until there's a bug that everyone didn't notice, Most of Armin Van Buuren's songs have Blah Blah song as lyrics... Which is surprising why would every song of the artist would have same lyrics, not even singles, but on songs multiple people have worked with Armin",0
"don't get it, Spotify doesn't work for me. I reinstall the app and nothing worked, it only happened today. Everytime I try to open it just keeps loading, I tried to open settings while loading and the entire app crashed. Good job.",0
I used to really enjoy the app im paying for premium the last update has made the currently playing song banner vanish.and the only way to do anything is to restart the app or turn the device off.im definately not happy,0
I did give this app 5*'s when I first started using it. I'm gonna have to drop that down to 3*'s. No more previewing songs. They totally did away with that in the search feature.,0
Fantastic app for music lovers,1
The daily updates are unnecessary.,0
It's good if your kid can't play bad music the parent can let them only,1
"It is very hard and aggravating to try to get into your personal playlist and pick the specific song you want to listen to. Maybe for the premium plan you can access it better, but I'm on the free plan. Also the ads are SUPER ANNOYING AND EXCESIVE. I do like the fact that I can listen to music without being on the actual app, so that is a big plus",0
Great app. Couldn't do without it.,1
Hear you had better algorithms.. it doesn't seem that way at all,0
Not working properly.. can't hear a preview when adding songs to any playlist and play bar disappears ðŸ˜‘,0
A great range of music,1
The app works great as far as music . However I will be using an alternative app that does not have podcasts that disseminates misinformation on Covid that results in increased morbidity and mortality.,0
"Has a lot of good features like live lyrics, downloadable songs, grouping playlists in folders, song queues... Unfortunately you will get disappointed and frustrated if you start using Spotify on different platforms as the most basic features work on one platform and don't work on another. This app has the most discrepancies I have ever seen in any app ever.",0
"really good app. I love using Spotify because it has most of my favorite tracks, the only issues I see are the fact that most Nintendo tracks aren't on Spotify and that I can't organize my playlist. 9/10",0
I love the discovery option. It's a great way to find new artists to listen to.,1
stays active to suck out your battery,0
Great app! Surprisingly Amazing!,1
I love it but too many ads,0
"It's clunky and not intuitive. Pauses all the time for no good reason. Will stop functioning properly and can only fix with a phone reboot. Nothing about the way its organized is intuitive. Really wish Rogan wasn't stuck on this platform, but money talks baby!",0
"No ads, just music",0
"New update has ruined the app, im unable to skip songs anymore and can't even see what songs playing... don't understand, hope it's fixed soon.",0
This app crashes every 10 minutes.,0
Good and have everything you looking for,1
This is my everyday medicine!!!!ðŸ’œðŸ˜ I Love this app a lotttttttttt ðŸ¤§,1
This is my favorite streaming app. Love it!,1
"After closing the app, Music still plays; also, there are way too many wackos streaming nonsense. The ads are sometimes really STRANGE, and our not appropriate. Time to uninstall",0
"I'm too happy with the update . I mean all the albums were arranged in a sequence specially kpop section is too well arranged , but still keep progressing , u have our support ,, love love ðŸ’•",1
Hate the ads for a minðŸ¤¦,0
Can you guys increase your streaming but rate even higher so we can get better sound quality.,0
A good music app when it works. I keep on running into issues where I click on songs in my liked music and they don't play. Also when I'm playing a playlist from my phone to the Xbox series x it randomly starts playing different music. This is ridiculous for a Â£10 a month subscription this needs to be fixed it's been happening for months. If these issues are not fixed soon I'm going to cancel my subscription and start using a different music subscription service.,0
i keep updated this app but I don't get the lyrics :((,0
"Songs selection very good. Not just English, it covers other countries songs as well. However for some reason I can't see the lyrics in my phone while I know at least one of my friends can in his iphone. Mine is Samsung s21. I can't figure out that yet.",0
"I refuse to rate this app well until there is as much polish on the Android app as there is on iOS. Please, Spotify devs, just bring the swipe to queue songs and the swipe gestures to close/open the now playing screen. Once this comes to Android I will be happy to rate 5 stars. Edit - quick queue added, improved rating.",0
Great listening  love it,1
bring back the old layout!!,0
"It works pretty good, and it have the music that I like. that's all that matters to me.",1
I love this app! I have ditched Pandora and I heart radio!,1
Cool app to use - has a bug where you can no longer play snippets of songs before adding them to your playlist making it harder to recognise tunes,0
Habing problems with this app w/samsung s22 ultra App all of the sudden does show the spng is playing or any way to control it. It forces you to close the app completely and then restart to have some control Normally love the app until this problem,0
You can't listen to a song with out going on a Playlist and you can't start over the song,0
"It kinda stinks that when you play your liked songs you can't pick two genres, you'd have to make a whole new playlist to accommodate your different moods. Please fix?",0
When I search for a specific song it plays something else (e.g: I search and play Sunday best and instead of Sunday best it plays something different) this app is very difficult to use and instead of raising vibes it raises stress I don't recommend this app as a medium for music,0
I Freakin love Spotify!!! It's PERFECT listen to ALL my favorites songs. I am a True Music lover from Old school to the newest I can't complain ðŸ’¯ satisfaction!,1
App keeps crashing everytime I open it and as a paying customer that is unacceptable. Please fix.,0
unless you pay for premium you aren't allowed to choose what you listen to. Spotify is literal garbage.,0
This is one of the best music app that I have download but it is not offline game and you have to have a wifi or load to connect :(,0
This app has always worked fine apart from the last month it cuts out continuously and says no internet connection. Every other app on my phone runs perfectly fine and there are no connection issues. Not sure if it is related to when my phone switches in and out of 4G/5G zones bu. The app is now non functional every ten minutes Edit: it has been another month and still bouncing around customer service with no solution at all!!,0
"my spotify started freezing and won't open. When I try to log in it pretends to log in and then shows the login screen again and doesn't log back in. It started happening like this last night, I logged out of my account and it stayed that way. I deleted the app, restored or restarted but still the same, please help.",0
Best app to listen to music. Very easy to use. I have the duo plan wich is pretty cheap for its offers and I've never experienced a bug/con on this app. 5/5,0
"I've been paying for this service for years but with the newest update it's practically unusable. I can't see what song is playing, and have no way to pause, skip, etc. I'm also using it to play music as my alarm and even if I snooze or stop, it just keeps playing forever or until it inevitably crashes as it so often does during normal use. I'm incredibly frustrated and if this isn't fixed fast I have no choice but to cancel my subscription of over 5 years and move on.",0
The app is amazing but I hate how you have to pay for no ads and for offline But in all is still great Edit 1 Its still great,1
Never had a problem .. I love this app,1
"I use this app everyday. At home, in the car, at the gym, on a walk, etc. I definitly recommend the SPOTIFY app!",1
In my opinion it's dumb that you can't pick what ever song you want to listen to without premium. you might aswell use YouTube unless they change it.,0
good,1
overall great but it has this bug that even if you are on the best netweok this app will show you that you are offline and really kills the mood,0
"Terrible, terrible experience. I can never navigate anywhere, the player plays music but doesn't show the controls/timeline, spins forever even if I have episodes downloaded, just an all-round fail.",0
"The widget on the lock screen is creating a lot of problems. Could not find a way to disable it. Samsung phone, Android 11.",0
"Latest version is terrible, playback controls (play/pause/forward/back) randomly disappear as you navigate the music selections.",0
I'm just a fan of Spotify- Sometimes I'm not very proud of how it works but I'll take whatever I can. I enjoy this app very much! Especially since I'm just the type of person to listen to music nonstop. I'd say it's good! You should give it a try and see it for yourself,1
Frequently stops playing songs or won't open. Downloaded music take forever to open when out of cellular service. App isn't great. Music selection is unlimited and tons of great playlist. When app does work it's a great experience.,1
"The heart button doesn't work, so I can't add songs to my liked songs",0
Easy way to listen on go. I use it for excercise.,0
I really enjoy listing to Spotify If im having a not so good day i just turn it on and my day gets better,1
Why did you get rid of the shuffle button? Put it back.,0
Fed with adds they come like 3 or 4 times in a row,0
I give this a 5 star because the app is designed well for Teens and adults. I really don't mine the ads on this app. My favorite part about this app is it has a setting for Explicit content. It shows E so I know if itis going to say bad stuff. I really injoy that because I don't like bad stuff. Also thay have clean versions of songs that I love. Thanks,0
"Look, I get it. You have premium. I will get so many options with it that I don't get in free account but stop playing premium ad after every single song. It's so annoying. I know that you have premium and i don't want it. So just stop rubbing premium ads in my face. Play some other ad. I am so sick of listening to premium ads.",0
Spotify is the best music app in the world,1
Love it to the moon and back. Clear and beautiful music. Everything I want is here.,1
"I used to love this app. But after the update I'm hating this. The song which i want to listen, which i play it gives u another song. It's really annoying. I can't listen the songs which i want to listen. If you can't listen to your favourite songs, then what's the point to use spotify? It says you can only skip the song if you buy the premium one. Dude i donâ€™t want to buy the premium one. Before updating this app it was too good but what happend after the update. Itâ€™s really annoying",0
There's some adds but it's usually fine,1
"I've been uninstall & reinstall this app for more than 10x, always auto close & back to my home screen, use the app for pc & phone, this problem only occur on my android phone, please do something otherwise i'll unsubscribe.",0
Playlist composition from different genres is impressively,1
The best app i have ever seen love this application !!!! It also gives u free trail for 4 month and u can cancel it any time ! In love witj this application ðŸ’œâ¤ï¸ðŸ’œâ¤ï¸,0
It's very good than the gaana app that i have tried so far...gaana app has sooooo much of adds and it has a little amount less than that....liked it ...can't give 5 stars because it sometimes dont connect to my airpods and I can't listen anything...then again have to disconnect and connect it..but overall very useful..oh! I can also listen to my favourite podcasts (review without premium membership).,1
I'll say it's the best app to listen songs but the ads are so annoyingðŸ˜« so I'll suggest you guys to get premium before they start the ads but you guys should download it.,0
"Just love this......thanks to this app,it has introduced me to great world of music. It's been 3 yrs since I have downloaded it ,had great experience , this app is totally flawless.",1
"It is very nice app, It helps us to remove our stress and give smile",1
I absolutely love this app. The free version is amazing and premium is even better. I get to listen on the way to work and simply whenever I want. There's music for everyone. As a lesson whose tastes varie from day to day and are simply all over the place I'm very satisfied. They also have people who are willing to help if there are any issues. 10 our of 10 in my opinion.,1
This is one of the good app for streaming audio but i have request if u could make the advertisement lesser because it's so annoying to listen 3 ads at a same time. more than songs ads plays it's just so annoying.,0
Covers all the music I enjoy,1
I wanted to use this for podcasts but I found that you can't import podcasts from other podcast apps (opml import).,0
I liked you till you don't even play the song you said your playing like really what the actual ef,1
I can't believe I'm still paying to hear ads during podcasts and have those podcasts randomly start over when I pause it.,0
"The following review is coming from a hardcore audiophile. I've been using Spotify for the last 2 years but didn't get the premium since I believed it was too expensive for just listening to audio. Many times I had thought of switching to other music apps, but once you go Spotify you won't go back. No other music app can hold a candle to Spotify in terms of UI, recommendations and music stock. Eventually I subscribed to the student premium using my stipend money. I haven't regretted it since.",0
Spotify has so many different music types and songs and it's an amazing app,1
"Downloaded music won't play without an internet connection. It used to, which allowed me to listen at work, but not anymore.",0
Amazing but you should add some then features from Apple music,1
Some good old and not too old music. Nice blend of world music.,1
"It (generally) has the music I want. But, their algorithm for suggesting music is garbage. If you listened to an album a month ago, it's in ""heavy rotation"". If you look up the same album everyday, It's forgotten about. I get recommendations for country music every week because I looked up a song once in December. I still get the same band recommended every week, despite indicating I hate that band. And the new UI update is less intuitive and more of a hassle to navigate, while I'm complaining..",0
Too many ads just to play a song,0
"I just wanted do a trial, but...... the ads after trial is over are beyond ridiculous. It also says that it will allow you to search a song after trial. But it doesn't let you look up a specific song once you're 2 weeks are up. It just send you to the artists albums. I barely used it during the 2 weeks. I'm very disappointed in the trial. I will not be purchasing. I'll just stick with YouTube Music.",0
"Spotify is different with everyone, I used Spotify with and without Premium (currently have it) Spotify is the bad apps to use for music if you don't have premium way to much ads and they are like 4 back to back all 30 sec and plays unrelated songs in ur playlist if u don't have premium. However if you have premium, it's the best place for music but there are some downfalls like if you want to listen to Ylang Ylang remix you can't because they aren't available in the app. Premium is required",0
"Nvm, free spotify sucks",0
"Rest all is amazing, the only problem is the large number of advertisements. The moment the mood lightens, advertisements are thrown on my face which makes it annoying many times. Please do something about that too.",0
My experience when it comes to using this app is truly ineffable. A huge shoutout to the developers of Spotify for coming up with such an amazing app.,1
This is a life saver when stuck at my mind-numbing job!!!,0
"worst performance, add appears very frequently. after every add they ensure 30 min break free music but within 10 min another add come. now a days multiple add come after every single music.",0
Would be the best app ever if there weren't so many glitches.,0
"Great app, just wish there were cheaper plans bc when your a kid and dont make bank and you want to listen to music...you dont really have the funds to give up 10 dollars a month...I know it doesn't sound like a lot but if you think about it, you not ""getting"" anything, you are enjoying music, and I guess you can just use the default like I do but it is just limiting. The app itself is great and has huge options and good quality, not glitchy and is great!",1
It crashes on every other song after this recent update.,0
Free version is a pain in ears nowadays. ADs r sucking irritating. Try to create value for more more customer acquisition. These things literally making us apart.,0
"The best music app,lots of song.But I'm facing a issue now,whenever I play a music it stops and goes to the home page.Please rectify it ASAP.",0
I love listening to my favorite songs anywhere anytime!,1
"Love Spotify it is worth every penny. I like that I can take my music everywhere I got with no enteruptions. You can find all kinds of stuff in the app to, not just music.",1
"Beautiful App helps concentrate even when I don't want to, like now, and will hear some soft, meditative songs of own choice and will accelerate my day with refreshness and productivity. - Damodar Boruah, Author, Assam",1
It keeps adding songs I don't want in my playlists and plays a different type of song when I select a specific song for. For example I select death bed but spotify changes it to like a different song and I hate it!,0
So Bad not in a good way. Don't try to change your password. You will never be able to log in again.,0
"Spotify's recent update has made it impossible to manage whatever I'm playing. There isn't a player at the bottom of the app, and the player widget also isn't working. In order to pause what I'm playing, I need to do a hard close of the app. In order to keep playing, I need to open the app and navigate to what I was trying to play. Edited to add: also, the playback on the app stops 5x/hour.",0
Worst app Finding ways to just earn money everyday,0
Awesome music streaming app,1
App now won't open. Worked fine for years yet now just freezes as it starts to open. Pointless unless they deal with this glitch.,0
"Spotify is absolutely awesome,",1
Nice app but only one problem is ads pop-up somtimes,0
can i have a fre premium please,1
It's pretty good but the adds are anoying without prwmium,1
"It's been stopping in the middle of songs and I don't have the option of the now playing screen where I can skip and replay, etc. This is really annoying. And I'm paying for it monthly. If I'm paying for it I should at least have a choice!",0
Best music streaming app,1
It's really nice to have a playlist for every mood you have but what is kinda annoying is when I want to listen to a song and I search for it but I still have to hear the whole playlist till I get to that song in the search bar I search for a specific song but I get a playlist it's kinda annoying but it's ok ig otherwise this app is everything,0
Selection of podcasts is good though I dont like that they practice viewpoint discrimination at times The bigger issue I have is that the app spontaneously crashes sometimes several times within 10-15 minutes,1
"Wont show the play bar, its been like this for a week now and i cant change it.",1
Premium purchase with google play balance not available. There should be a option to purchase premium via Google play balance.,0
Spotify is very useful I like how the app works you can download your songs and listen to them without Wi-Fi it really helps me especially when my data finishes I'm on my way back to my house and there's nothing to do cuz I don't have any data I can use the Spotify and listen to my downloaded songs I really like this app and that's why I gave it a five star for me there I no ads because I paid for the premium and I find it very useful,1
"Generally good, but there's an issue where the file size starts to expand that can only be fixed by uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I listen to Spotify A LOT so it leaves me doing this two to three times a week or having a 3 to 6 GB app. It just gets old.",0
app is great! but please add the swipe queue feature like on ios and add some widgets for the android 12 please!!! thank you!!!!,1
Not 5 stars because from one moth or two appart in the playlists or liked songs it appears a metric ton of recommended music (wich is not even related to any of in the playlists)... Fortunately is only for a moth or two appart... But the rest (normal ads) I'm okay with it.,0
2 much ads,0
Hi to all of,1
I add songs to my liked songs they be unliked please fix this,1
Great app . A lot a songs old and new . Never a dull moment. Gets me through the day n night. Keep it up .,1
It's good the first time I downloaded it but now I cant even play in shuffle or play the songs unless I have premium but it's still a pretty good app,1
"If you like listening to adds this app is for you, but for music there are tons of better alternatives that let you enjoy songs with very minimal interruptions!",1
you can add as many of fav. tune as you want......awsome.,1
"its a very good app! you can listen to other creaters music, create playlists, listen to other ppls playlists, follow creaters and ppl using the app aswell. very interactive with no lag and you can listen to all music on the app for free. the ads can be bad like every 4 songs i get 2-3 ads bad i understand thats how you make money and get others to listen to your content overall the issue is bareable and reasonable. i recommend!",1
Fantastic music app and probablythe best,1
It wont let me lisen to my liked songs playlist without Shuffle on the whenever I use my laptop I can turn Shuffle on and off but I can't do it on my phone and whenever I use Spotify on my laptop I get as many skips as I want but whenever I listen on my phone I only get 6 Skip's per hour and on my phone I can't just play the specific song on my playlist but on my laptop I can,0
Dark theme also not user friendly. Can't even see playback slider and play/pause button not visible. Such carelessness wasn't expected.,0
I wish app had a way to go back to recently played like pandora app to like songs that just played. Over all updated and trendy.,0
Sometimes it lags,0
It's a great app. Whatever music I want whenever I want it.,1
Sorry but I can't figure out how the updated version works. I can't play the songs I want to listen and the shuffle play is making me mad.,0
"Though not bad enough. But the we want to play, it plays another one. That is annoying thing.",0
I like the previous interface which had a distinction between 'podcasts' and 'music'. The current one feels like too much clutter,0
Please fix this app. Sometimes i choose to play a song then it plays something else,0
When I add a song I can't even listen to it to see if I like it,0
Slow app and more ads,0
Paid for the premium and enjoy the ease of use with no ads. Would give it 5 stars if the free version didn't have so many ads and you could select the song you want on your playlist rather than having to listen to it on random.,1
no option to stop music keeps playing in background... where is the PLAY button..?,0
Can I subscribe to premium via Google play? Cannot find the options beside Visa and PayPal.,0
I've been using this app since 2015 and I've loved it. Of course it has had it's fair share of bugs throughout the years but I can honestly say that it's the best one of all.,1
"For whatever reason the bar to pause, skip, like a song is missing.",0
Click on app and click on artits and music comes out,0
With folders for each Playlist. I can change my mood with ease.,1
"Sessions on joined devices are kinda buggy (not the one in the sand lmao). The ""listen on same device"" dialog is missing, therefore they output the music on the joined devices as well",0
Good sound quality,1
Unresponsive. I have premium. A month ago or so the app started freezing. The music stops suddenly and the controller or son panel magically disappears so I can't pause or change the song. Extremely annoying. Same thing happens on my PC.,0
When I try to download and listen to a song you can't listen to it with a little things not there but when I logged in and log back out again back in and it appears but this happens every time,0
Songs I previously downloaded are now showing as not downloaded because I updated the app. Rubbish I have to start over and download over 200 songs that's really bad..,0
The best music app i had ðŸ¥°ðŸ¤© great lyrics and artist,1
I love spotify cuz i can listen to all of my fav songs. But the ads do get annoying,0
It's annoying because it stops playing in the middle of a song. Sometimes only 5 seconds into a song. Fix it!,0
"For some reason...My music is going fast. I have no idea what to do, or anything. I'm quite frustrated with something causing this. This the second time I had some kind of issue with this app, last time it was something to do the music not playing at all, speeding up without option to slow it down, and playing in the background after the music has been stopped. Anyways if anyone is having the same issue did you ever receive help? at all?",0
It's such a failure it won't let me pick the song I want ager a month if they don't fix this I'm never using this again,0
Good ,1
Look I got the ads part but not being able to restart the song or not being able to skip tracks for another 30 mins? Are u kidding? That just makes peopel wanna delete the app instead of paying for premium.,0
Ur just the best I've already recommended this apps to so many of my friends tumb up to you guys,1
Don't like too much ads coming at same time,0
It is terrible unless you have premium or want to listen to a playlist. They made listening to songs a premium feature.,0
"Shocking. Won't play for more than a few seconds, keeps crashing, and cannot see the what's playing bar anymore. Trying to update and just get the spinning wheel of doom. I'm taking my money elsewhere ðŸ˜’",0
"Awesome app ,can't believe I've only started using it now, I've been missing out on the best experience ever, Awesome.",1
Sometimes it hangs when connected to bluetooth audio device,0
Spotify is absolutely brilliant thank you for all my different library's of music.,1
"Best music streaming app so far, Music database is good but still lacking a few old records. But it's okay..",1
Spotify is great but sometimes the ads are iritating,0
"Third class application. Even after connected to wifi it showing no internet connection. Spotify, please improve application instead of adding ads. Such loose marketing it is.",0
"Download songs are not showing offline after 2,3 days without internet , fix it",0
App won't work for me at all. I can't play any music and I have premium! It also says all playlists are empty. The app used to work perfectly for me now I can't get it to work on this device at all.,0
What the hell is the purpose of offline music if you're going to delete them all after updating the app or before renewing my Premium! Now I have to buy cellular data and download 1000 hq songs. Do some better programming!!!,0
Used to have this at 5 stars now at 2. Why? The app keeps crashing and it got irritating I tried updating the app but it just made it worse. I cannot listen to music properly now PLS fix this and I will edit my review to a 5 star again.,0
Keeps pausing on playback.,0
A very amazing app. really helpful on stress full days,1
I love Spotify!! I have ALWAYS been able to find every song I'm looking for and every podcast too. Paying for premium is 100% worth it. Spotify is THE BEST app and I choose it over all the others out there. Thanks for being amazing Spotify ðŸ‘ðŸ˜.,1
I am so enjoying the music not really in advertising but I do tell my friends ðŸ¤ ,1
"I've known this app for quite a long time but was never interested in using it but the moment I attempted making use of the app, I never looked back. The developers of the app did a great job in creating such a master piece of an app. No wonder it's the 1 streaming app in the US.ðŸ™Œ",1
"Gone pretty downhill, lots of bugs",0
Ads.... ans cant skip more than 6 times.,0
I use to love Spotify. I enjoy listening to podcasts but lately the app had been acting up. I will stop out of nowhere. Or it will say that it is playing when it isn't ðŸ¤” I'm thinking of Unsubscribing but I have hope this will be fix â˜¹ï¸ðŸ˜ž,0
Great app gets better and better every day,1
"Recent bug makes the app unusable. The now playing bar disappears so you can't skip, pause or play songs without force quitting the app.",0
Best app for music listening but you can't play and download music that you love.,1
"Songs stop unexpected, currently playing song dissapeard from the app, how am I supposed to change the song?",0
Enjoying lisyening music esp. Worship and praising songs. Thanks,1
Nice adds ,1
"Thanks for providing so many ads here, I frequently come here to listen to those ads. I just love it ðŸ˜˜",1
Awesome has some of my favorite podcast and all my favorite ðŸŽ¶,1
Near perfect algorithm,1
I love all the music i play,1
"Love my Spotify. The biggest issue I have is since my last phone update. Everytime my phone screen goes black Spotify stops. I have been all over the ap and my phone, can't figure out why.",0
"Shocking. What happened to Spotify? Okay so I can deal with a 30 second ad to have 30 minutes uninterrupted music, but what the hell is with the ""only 6 skips"" thing? That is absolutely ridiculous. Spotify 10 years ago used to be the go to place for streaming, a genuine company that didn't try to rake all the cash they could off people. Now it's just ""pay for this, pay for that"" Been around since spring 2009 but I don't feel welcome without paying. Such a shame, won't be using ever again sadly.",0
It was amazing while it worked,1
I love spotify so much. Spotify is good app for listening music but after some weeks. When I open app for listening music I go to search and search song but only albums I see and don't listening music,0
I am a paid subscriber. When I use the app without internet it takes several minutes to load my podcasts and songs. Why? I unistalled and installed it back again. No improvements. Help.,0
"Good all around, also their premium subscribers are totally worth it. I listen to a lot of top artists and they are totally reliable",1
Terrible app for free user it's Soo bad I am very disappointed of Spotify u can't listen to the song want to listen to it will play random song in your playlist also you have to add the song u want to listen in your playlist I would rather use Spotify web player it's suck for free user u need to buy premium if u really want to use this app ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,0
Imagine creating a Playlist and then only listening to what Spotify recommends and nothing apart of that playlist.,0
"Even after upgrading to premium, I'm unable to use Canvas feature... There's no such option as ""Canvas"" in the setting. Please solve this issue, one of my friend is also facing the same in Android version. Feels like Spotify doesn't give a f about us and only taking care of iPhone users.",0
I have had the same songs constantly on my daily mixes no matter how many different genres or artists I listen to. I've had this issue for 2 whole years. Customer supports solution worked for about 2 weeks.,0
"Spotify is simply awesome to say the least, the most is that I've been able to find music that's a lot of time unavailable on other apps. I like the fact that I can pretty much listen to the songs I love anywhere I go. Two thumbs up to SpotifyðŸŒ„ðŸŒŒâ›ªðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡²ðŸžðŸ¦‹ðŸžðŸðŸŒ»â˜˜ðŸ‘½ðŸ™ðŸ¾ðŸ™ðŸ¾",1
I have changed my Spotify account from India to Germany and I am unable to hear my favorite songs on this account . Hence 2 star,0
Why lyrics is not appearing? I'm on premium for almost a year.,0
"I'm a longtime customer and love Spotify! I use it all day, everyday! Lately it's been having issues and cutting out! It's done it several times today! Please please fix it so I can go back up to 5 stars!!!!",0
Won't play anything that I select. It just gives me a black screen. A little mad since I just paid for premium.,0
"Ok i don't have premium subscription but what does it mean..? It's almost after every single song, i have to suffer with add.. Too irritating and tired of this now..",0
GREAT APP,1
"Pretty Good App. Only downside is it's sucks when you don't have premium, cause of all the ads. But you can control that ðŸ™‚",1
Sure I've been using Spotify for a while now. It's good but there needs to be more skips. Not to mention I'd like if there wasn't ads for 90â„… of the time I listen to music in 1 HOUR!!,0
This is a must have if you enjoy ad free music.,0
This is the best music app. I loved it and suggest you to download it â¤â¤,1
"It's a nice music listenning app well nice not excellent but ads are too after every 2nd song add comes, it too long . At last no complaints",0
"Great way to listen to music! Playlist curated for you, plus you can choose radio ""stations"" or make your own Playlists, listen to albums, artists, etc.",1
Podcast player queue is broken. Podcast will lose position and skip to next podcast after ads. Music player shuffle mode seems to give some song higher priority than other.,0
Very good app you can listen songs while your phone is off and the sound is very soft and good,1
Its 2022 & High time to introduce Lossless audio option on Spotify. Come on!!,0
"Good for music but there are too many ads , every 2 songs i listen to there is a double add",0
I love sporify but you messed it up. I want to play my playlist nope you give me a random song I don't even know. Also what happened to me being able to view my playlist? Now it just plays whatever song it wants first instead of being in order. If you could fix this I would feel a lot better that you for your time!,0
Been a member more than 3 years. Still meets my expectation of getting good quality of music and updated songs,1
"Recently it started to crush every time I use it... It is not for the first time, even though I have pro account. Edit: Since I started to use it again, it is working very well!!",1
"Great app for music, I like the weekly Playlists based off of previously liked songs",1
So good and It tells you how much storage storage that you have on ur phone and how much u used and what other apps take its amazing,1
Great music platform use it all the time !!,1
Love it but why did they add it where if I play the song on my tv they show a picture of the artist's profile picture as the background? I liked the solid color with the album cover in the corner better. I couldn't find a way to turn it off either. Love Mac DeMarco but it jumpscared me seeing his face out of nowhere. Need an option to take it off. Ruins the aesthetic.,0
Latest update: Spotify playing but not showing controls.,0
The App just isn't playing the music when i cast it to my tv.,0
I got it for free for staking my crypto Dotcom Ruby card. No complaints for a free product! Love the enhance playlist functionality!,0
"Question: I got a free version with ads. The ad will play for 30 seconds and Spotify will announce that next 30 mins are ad free. So my question is what does ad free and 30.mins means? Because the ads will continue after the announcement and once that's over, more ads will start after around 15 mins. Don't know if to trust the paid version. The music is very limited. 6 months and you are done with Hindi music",0
Love it so far,1
Best,1
"The only thing that sucks is the fact that ur downloaded music is taken away and have to redownload it after missing a payment. Other than that, pretty solid and a lot of variety of music.",0
"There needs to be more options for parental controls and video disable. Spotify family needs to have a LOT more options than kids, or everything. Figure it out.",0
"Really like this app. Have a ton of music. I personally like listening to gospel music, and I have a lot of people that I am a fan of. I had trouble that my backround music was spotify. I gave them 3 stars, and contacted them. Soon they responded and told me to reinstall the app. Did that. No problems now. So I will keep my promise, and give u stars",1
Horrible app to use. Literally unusable in the free version.,0
Great podcast section,1
Very Good App Of Music Loving It,1
"Very good , my favourite songs are available",1
"ðŸ‘Ž Sound is decreasing when comparing to other apps and albums shows few popular songs only ðŸ‘Ž, playlists are interesting ðŸ‘,fix well.",0
Nice ,1
It is the best app to listen music on.,1
I never really checked out Spotify & I must say that I'm pleasantly surprised at the choices.,1
Nic,1
This is a great app with very good music quality,1
"Love spotify and never had any issues with the app until a few days ago. My most recent songs i put in my liked songs wont play when i click on them, they only play if i put every song manually in the cue. Idk if this is a bug or whatever but its very frustrating.",0
"Stop breaking the app with useless UI updates, and stop removing music you don't like the politics of.",0
It rarely shows what song I'm playing. Stops randomly and still plays at times adds even though Im been paying for premium.,0
Would give 5 stars but it is hard to listen to my Playlist if not connected to the internet. 95% of the time it's great.,0
100% the only acceptable music app to use,0
"At first I rated this a lot lower because I wasn't finding anything that was making Premium special... but now Spotify has grown on me, so I wanted to upgrade my review...",0
Thanks for the new update ,1
"It's inexcusable that a large and well established company/app should have the glitches and bugs that it does. Spotify, will you refund me for the failure to deliver as promised?",0
Whenever I start to play any song add starts popping up I thought that the add will stop after playing one or two but this showed me 4 ads and it wasted a lot of my time. This is sooo annoying that we can't even skip any ads please do anything for this and reduce ads,0
"Sometimes the bottom bar disappears and I can't see what is currently playing, nor can I pause, change the song",0
"My podcasts keep cutting in and out, the status bar goes away, and there is no longer a pause, skip, etc on my lock screen",0
Everything is good in this app but i don't know why lyrics are not shown in my phone....please fix my problem...,0
Spotify plays all of my favorite songs ðŸŽµ,1
Absolutely love this app. Works pretty seamlessly between all of my devices and is easy to use. My only wish would be a way to leave ratings on podcasts in particular so I can support them more directly.,1
"The app is user friend, fantastic ui look and great user experience, ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¿",1
Unable to scroll through my 3k liked songs. Been listening on shuffle since last major update.,0
Easy access to play my favorite music at any time. Easy to find my favorite artist and the songs with lyrics,1
Appreciate you guys still standing for free speech. Keep up the good work.,1
"Very slow, keeps crashing, removed car mode",0
Best music app I've ever used. But one major improvement on this app is to download the songs individually without liking and downloading them.,0
Lots of options when it comes to artists and albums. I also appreciate the fact that I can access all this great music for free. The audio(output) though is not that great hence the 4 stars instead of 5.,0
"its pretty good overall, but theres so many god damn ads! i know that people need money and all, but jeez, theres way too many ads. maybe have like one or two ads every four or five songs?",0
"Mp3 songs best quality but 3 & 4 songs 30 second ads extra....,",0
"Some bugs on Android 12. Album artwork doesn't display on the now playing bar, when you search within a playlist the keyboard doesn't come up. When I'm playing on bluetooth and I open the app, the song will skip a bit. Small things but they've been going on for over a year during which I've switched phones and still have the same exact bugs.",0
I've had Spotify premium since 2017 and it's never failed to provide the right tunes when nessecary. Never need wifi to play a song. Spotify is the BEST!!!,1
"I have Spotify premium, I was loving it, but the last couple of weeks it has been complete rubbish. When streaming to my Heos speakers It constantly stops during a song and drops out, comes back, drops out again. It is so annoying - I hope its fixed soon, as I dont know if I want tp pay for a continually glitchy service.",0
"I've tried them all. It's the one I pay for. Would love more if my volume control worked better. Never listened to Joe Rogan but if he goes, I go.",0
I've tried all of the top music apps and I haven't been able to find another one that is as user friendly and cost effective as Spotify. So I want to thank you Spotify and I'm sure my neighbors want to as well!,1
Awesome,1
"Will not stop, stopping while I'm trying to listen to music and playing a game with no sound on.",1
"Love it Wide batch of artists Actually recommending songs you like and the release radars, just amazing I would love however to be able to share my like songs in the form of a playlist to my friends or have them be able to see like a form of stats",1
Love it,1
Cant like any songs or unlike them since about a month,0
"The new update broke app, please roll it back. I'm paying for premium.",0
"Great music app, premium is even better.",1
"The music plays instantly with lyrics as well, that's super cool",1
It seemed easy to go to places where I wanted to go and had a great selection of music,1
"Always loved spotify but as of recently it would only play like 20 of my 3000 sum odd songs before I would have to re shuffle, I'm sure they did this for cache reasons but I'm not a big fan of it",0
It's annoying like when ever I'm doing my play list it comes up with random songs that I don't like ðŸ˜ andit evens makes me so frustrated with this app I did it as a 1 star because it doesn't play Ur song it plays something else.,0
Great aap so good there r so many of songs and playlists for everything,1
Great experience I get all the songs I need when I need them.,1
Unstable performance on S22 Ultra. Podcast will play for 5-10min then begin skipping. Then will stop playing. Happen with downloaded content. Happens with normal play. Happens in airplane mode. Happens after Uninstalled and reinstalled. Previously worked flawlessly on Pixel 5 and S6.,0
"Poof, my local files are gone. Despite being on my phone in the same folder as always. Why? Lord knows.",0
Enjoying access to a great collection of music. Different genre.,1
Really surprised at the ease of use and the content. Should have been on years ago but didn't realize you had a free version. Great,0
"I'm extremely annoyed with the way the app automatically logs out of my account. For the last 2 days I haven't been able to access it via any mode whether its facebook or google or using my own account id and password. Have tried all possible ways of solving the issue whether it's reinstalling or clearing the cache but still the app just doesn't work. Had it not been my curated playlist of liked songs, I would have uninstalled it long time back. Best collection of music but worst operation",0
"Worst app ever. When I search up a song to play, it doesn't play it when I hit play, it plays another song that I have no interest in. This app sucks, don't get it.",0
Love this music app! We never have any issues with loading or finding new music or podcasts. Easy to navigate. Easy to give ratings on podcasts. Love it!,1
"I only have this app to listen to Joe Rogan,if yinz kicknhim off I'll just delete your app as well.i don't Care about any artist you offer on here.there are alot of other music sharing apps.an I stand with our brothers and sisters in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.",0
Overall good! Have noticed a lot more ad's in-between songs which I dislike.,1
"Great music choices, recent update has a bug in which the current music playing doesn't display at the bottom of screen when on the home screen. Fix that and you get 5 stars!",0
Just needed to auto update,0
"I'm satisfied haven't used any other music apps so I couldn't tell ya. I tend to stick to what I know, and I don't know much.",0
Killer tunes at your fingertips at a reasonable price All genres Podcasts that will amaze you too a bit of everything Get it,1
"If we are using for 30 mins , 10 mins only song will come... Remaining 20 mins Ads only will come... Contains more ad's... Very disappointed ðŸ‘Ž",0
this is so nice ,1
Love this,1
Player often does not work correctly and Too many ads. Prefer Pandora and Amazon Music. And they deleted Neil Young music.,0
It's an amazing app and I love it. Definitely recommend,1
stopped working after 2 months of being downloaded updated it and everything reinstalled over and over again did everything i thought i might need to do to fix it didnt work,0
Best app ever! 5 stars! And thank you spotify for not canceling/censoring something just because it is different!,1
Very rarely produces any new or different music. Just try to play the same few songs over and over on all play list.,0
"Used to be 5 stars but recently theres a lot going wrong with the app. It's buggy and glitchy. Music randomly stops, sometimes the song won't show up when I press play and I can't replay/skip/etc. Also lock screen/notification widgets aren't working anymore. I can't skip/change songs etc. without unlocking my phone and going into the app. Never had problems like this before a month or two ago, but I'm seeing that a lot of people here are having these problems. What's going on?",0
The car stereo still doesn't show song titles after changing songs. (Bluetooth connection). The latest version where it worked was spotify-8-5-98-984.,0
I love this app u can turn ur phone off and still hear the song it doesn't turn off,1
bruh why did you guys add an auto shuffle that you can't disable. not only that but why do y'all add songs to playlists for no reason.,0
Great selection of music and information!,1
Spotify is a good app but the fact you can't turn off shuffle and keeps playing different songs is really annoying if you are gonna it that way count me out,0
"""Premium"" still allows ads. Interface is confusing and hard to navigate. Has no problem providing a platform to misinformation.",0
"Bugs for months! The app is close to unusable. Unacceptable, especially for Spotify premium A podcast started playing midway through a phone call. Controls for 'currently playing' not coming up in the app. Including no sign that Spotify is playing at all. Let alone outside of it on the screen or drop down menu. Randomly stops playing music. This is a previous bug that has also been occuring in recent updates.",0
"So, unfortunately after their most recent update, it seems I and a few others can no longer use Spotify. I haven't been able to listen to Spotify for a good week and a half now. Every time I try to listen to my playlist, it'll just endlessly load. It's really a shame because Spotify has been my go to music app for a while now. I've tried all the recommendations to fix this, and nothing has worked. I downloaded YT Music and I'm remaking my playlist there. I may come back if the issue gets fixed.",0
LIVE Spotify!!! I refuse to use any other music app. XOXO,0
Stressful App.. Keeps stopping every now and then.. Spotify Fix these issues,0
"It's a good app with premium but as soon as it runs out you have ads and you can't skip songs if you do it to much for a hour, A FLIPPING HOUR!! so I only really recommend if you can afford premium",1
"Basically, its none of the much, but it is in concerned with the privacy of users. So, I would like to point it out. ""In android there is a feature which allows users to hide all notification in screen lock. But spotify does not follow the same."" In next update make sure to get this one. Overall, app is doing great.",1
"I like that your apps will always suggest more artist I enjoy hearing. You cater for my taste in music, I guess that is everyone else's experience as well.",1
"Just a cash grab at this point, they stopped giving me my 30 minutes of uninterrupted music and I don't know why, I can only skip 6 songs (and it's extremely frustrating when a song I don't know comes on that I didn't put on my playlist) I can't even chose the song I want to listen to and the audio keeps skipping during the songs, just use an adblocker website and listen to music that way guys",0
One of the best app,1
Excellent app. Very rarely is a song choice not available.,0
"I have the paid version of Spotify, and along with the YouTube-Pro app it's become one of my most used apps! For anyone still buying albums/singles on CD, give Spotify a try and you'll soon realise this is the way forward in 2022. If the ads annoy you, get the ""pro"" version, it's worth EVERY penny. For the cost of a SINGLE ALBUM each month, instead of just one album you get almost EVERY album ever made! Seriously, give the paid version a try! Without ads it's so much better! 10/10",0
I love all the podcast,1
Good experience but not being able to play specific song unless you are premium is not cool at all .,1
Cool fine tunes every time everywhere,1
Editing my review. they say they would play only 30 second ads but wth...i see 6 consecutive ads after just 2-3 songs just spoil my day.,0
Spotify is the BEST!!! If you don't have premium then you have limited options but when you get premium it is amazing. You can download and listen offline and play songs individually.,1
"Used to be a good app, but after a couple of updates, it became impossible to actually listen to the stuff you chose without having to listen to both ads and other songs it 'recommends' to you. No looping or skipping, you can't even find and listen to to singular song because as soon as you play that song ""on its own"" Spotify puts it into an auto generated playlist that doesn't even start with the chosen song.",0
Nice,1
"One star (from 4) until they fix this latest version. Player widget disappears, has issues with Android Auto too. Ugh.",0
Its been pretty easy to use but there are some songs that are not on spotify that i want to listen to,0
Amazing Experience But could you just provide a song recognition featureðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
"I'd like to identify issues. -Music volume goes down on apple when battery low. nearly audible -Crashes do occur on certain devices -bro, come out with your own headset. Annoyed you guys aren't taking initiative -where do you store music on my device? You're being shady -add a permission so I can't accidentally close Spotify -""are you still listening"" setting every 50 songs or something to save battery. Automatic close app. Anyways, hope someone reads this",0
The subscrition is totally worth it also I like the year playlists as well,1
Oops! Well wishy washy fence-sitting company with a meh app caves to radical leftist cancel culture. Free speech is free speech even if you don't agree with it. We're not communist China but you're sure helping us get there. DELETED APP plenty of other options.,0
Awesome experience. I wish there was a discount for veterans. I love the Spotify structure. My ears need music now!,1
Love it can hear all the music and podcasts I want.,1
Love the old and obscure music you can find on Spotify!,1
It's just perfect... the best app ever!,1
It's spectacular to listening your favorite music everywhere you are,1
seriously so good. their system is great. music wow ðŸ˜».,1
"The experience could be improved for offline mode. If I start playing a playlist that I downloaded already online, I'm unable to just continue playing it if I go offline. I must replay it from scratch, which is a problem if I was playing in shuffle mode. Please improve on that. Also, if a Spotify playlist is updated by just reshuffling tracks, songs don't need to be downloaded again if they've already been downloaded. Please find a way to just rearrange without downloading again.",0
LOVE IT SOO MUCH I LISTEN TO ALL MY FAVORITE SONGS!!ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„,1
"Easy to use, and good content",1
Does not always play the exact music required,0
"Good marketing strategy on ads which intentionally leads to use or listen to this app 30 mins. The next 30 mins. After an update or long break for usage i am unabke to open the existing account this is my 3rd account.â˜¹ï¸ðŸ‘ŽBut still i am using this app because UI is good, otherwise i would change..",1
"It's just pathetic. You cant choose what song you want to play because it will always take you onto A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SONG. I had a playlist with only friday and rasputin in it because it's my birthday soon and I was going to add more. I press play and it played ""let me take you dancing"". WICH ISNT EVEN IN THE PLAYLIST!!! it's impossible to use and so frustrating. No point of downloading it what so ever!!! Its not just that either, its constant!!! You cant even scroll through songs!",0
"Works for me. Don't use it very often. Today is a rainy day, and some music is more than welcome.",1
"After update if i choose one song in library, after the one song finish in second song.. the secong song was stop the middle of listening.. why??? And the song bar now is dissapeared.. just gone.. dont understand why again? Maybe should stop subscibe premium, uselesss aplication",0
I love this app it is the best app for music in my opinion but I hate how I'm listening to a song it ends and a whole different song pops up not even in my playlist I get it's supposed to get you into new music but it is so annoying I can be listening to my favorite song I cannot wait for this next song I really like here's a song that I've never liked and the artist is not the best otherwise it's pretty good app,1
Plis upload some new songs. I m so excited.,1
"I Love Spotify, but I only thing that make me give 4 stars, is about the lyrics' songs, in some song they're not available, and if the others the lyrics disappear.",0
"It such an amazing app to use,while busy with choresâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸.....I mean there is no need of making your playlist. They have everything you need.",1
Went down the drain. As the app updates rolled on the app got worse. Well once you took my Playlist I had and took the shuffle feature away to what was left. Well on I go. Pandora wins.,0
This music app good. This music app has alot of songs such as trending and old songs. It's have all the generation songs. In my opinion is this is a best app ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯,1
"The app keeps freezing and not showing what I'm currently playing so I have to exit the app and reopen it to refresh. It's quite annoying. I'll make you a deal spotify, if you can fix this issue then I'll give you that 5th star.",0
"Music stops and plays, after latest Spotify app update on Samsung Galaxy Note 20 ultra 5g, music seems to now stop and play with no reason, music downloaded, phone software upto date, solid Internet connection, Bluetooth headphone upto date, never had this issue before recent update, restarted phone and still no luck even reinstalled Spotify! Not worth paying for premium with problems like this, rather use YouTube which wouldn't have this issue!",0
need to fix ability to correct passwords,0
The app is good but the ads are annoying,0
"What a ridiculous amount of Ads. Nine in and haven't heard a song yet ... nine before I decided to come here and comment. They are still going. Then, once a song starts, even if you don't finish it, you'll get an ad before the next one plays, only one ad if you are lucky. Terrible app. Interface is lacking, can't find songs easily enough. They don't even pay artists very well. No thanks.",0
Will rate 5 stars but the music keeps cutting out and when I'm listening to podcast it won't even show that anything is playing while playing that podcast. Even when I close Spotify it still continues to play. I have to restart my phone for it to stop. Please fix or I will undo my subscription.,0
"The default music app. This newest update makes it incredibly laggy, especially on startup and when scrolling through large playlists. Update: I now have to relaunch the app twice every time for it to work properly. Every update seems to make the app worse",0
All song play with high sound and clearly audio listing,1
Update the style music selection keeps gltiching out and making me mad,0
"It shouldn't be this difficult to use a music app. I want to the app to play songs *in the order I add them* although it has a sort feature to select recently added, it starts in the middle of my Playlist, and not, you know, recently added. Beyond frustrating to have to force stop an app every time I use it to get it to work right. Absolute garbage.",0
"Love, but..app has had alot of bug issues lately. No play bar, not connecting to Bluetooth, crashing. Please fix",0
Amazing app!!! Hard to add song to playlist.,0
"I been a loyal subscriber for years probably a good 5 years maybe but id say the only problem is that when you go to ur liked songs an you are looking for a specific genre out of the music you've liked the list of genre on your liked songs isn't accurate an it's a bit of a pain cause if it was accurate it would be the best for each mood, for example ""wait a minute"" by willow is pop an alt but it doesn't pop up on my pop genre an I don't even have a alt selection even though I have a lot of alt",0
"If I could give it 0 stars, I would. It used to be good but now it glitches and crashes all the time. If I didn't have months of premium left on my account , I would of went to a different streaming service by now. Maybe instead of worrying about Joe Rogan, Spotify's employees should focus on fixing the bugs and crashes this app has on Android all the time.",0
"Still connects to my car and no option to make it stop. I can pause it, but restarts after each gmaps voice instruction or call. Really annoying. Lately, an add is delivered 5 minutes after JRE podcast starts. Ok, fair enough. After the add ends though, the podcast restarts. Twice in a row. I had to go beyond that moment to be able to listen further.",0
"Worst android port, I want to listen to a single song right? It adds recommended songs, like bro I want 1 song",1
Excellent app! Easy to use and have no complaints.,1
Sooooo good app to listen to music from and real original music.,1
"It keeps losing track of itself. Plays music when its paused, sometimes plats music without the abulity to pause (no status bar).",0
I love this app! It is just perfect for music. The reason I'm giving it 4 Stars is because you have to pay for premium if you want to download music for offline listening,1
Personally my experience is been good but recently evry time i start a song pause or a next song starts my phone shuts off and it's very annoying please fix this Spotify,0
The app works well with high quality audio and seemless continuation playback from different devices. A very useful feature for me,1
Easy app to use and search for your favorite tunes,1
My experience with the Spotify was very good,1
"The best listening music I can find,to hear at work. A lot us listen to music, however most use ear bugs. Thanks ,",1
A lot of issues since the last update. No player showing up while the music is playing. App crashes willy-nilly. Used to be just great an update ago. What happened?,0
"When I'm listening music on this device or any other, it pauses, I checked the settings out and nothing. It's really uncomfortable that it just keep pausing",0
"Dude not only do you guys mess up the scroll bar you also make it hard to swipe the song....whatever you call it, away. So now if Im not listening I have to close the app completly. Just stop messing with the tools. Also fix the thing where I have to restart the app everytime because it doesnt let me do or play anything. Dude when are you gonna fix your damn app I dont pay almost 15 a month for this bs.",0
Best app for music listening!!,1
Stop moving all the controls I am constantly looking for everything that can't be the idea.,0
Good,1
"The app has horrendous lag on my Note 10+ yet works fine on my brother's phone, I am fully updated to the newest version I can, and the issue persists. There is something deeply wrong with this app, and it needs to be figured out soon.",0
Unbelievably the best. Lost of words really,1
When i open the app it's automatically closing,0
I wish the sound quality was a bit better!,0
Audio cuts out sporadically. Doesn't show the play bar until you close app and open again.,0
"has too many ads, but other than that great app!",0
"It's a great music player app but it's just missing one thing.... A ""play next"" fiction would be really helpful when we listening to songs and it'll make things much easier for us if you'd add it. Thank You",0
"Amazing music and stay entertained 24/7 all moods, and all that jazz for all seasons only on Spotify!!!",1
This app is good but when I make a Playlist with songs i WANT to listen to the app adds songs I don't wanna listen to please fix this.,1
"30 minutes it's a lie, and it doesn't work always",0
Cool but maybe just play the song I click not other ones I don't like and stop adding songs to my playlist s just let me vibe,1
"After so many years in operation, one would think that they would fix al least some of the bugs.",0
"It gets very annoying and frustrating because of the amount of ads. After every 1-2 songs, they will put in 3 ads in a row. Put one ad in between every 4 songs, but they just go crazy when it comes to putting ads. Its annoying to get ads 3 TIMES IN A ROW when you are enjoying some songs. I know you are supposed to get spotify premium for no ads, but come on, not everyone is wanting or allowed to spend money for listening to songs.",0
"My worst experience ever with this app, since last week it is only displaying no internet connection while connected to wifi network and works smoothly while on mobile data hating it since then",0
"This app has every music gender, plus has affordable monthly membership plans that let you rewind, fast forward, go back to a Pacific part or line in a song or skip to the next one without any adds. I love how you can make Playlists and it saves them as long as you are a paid member, even gives recommendations of other songs, albums, podcasts, interviews with artists and so much more. Giving 5ðŸ’«ðŸ’«ðŸ’«ðŸ’«ðŸ’« out of 5ðŸ’«ðŸ’«ðŸ’«ðŸ’«ðŸ’« with two thumbs up ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾.",1
This app is amazing! I can listen to music while playing my game and I LOVE that I can leave the app and it still plays music. I recommend you getting this app because it's amazing!,1
"Convenient, however extremely buggy, especially in offline mode. Beware, it will suddenly erases all your downloads, prevent you from adjusting playlists because it complains of being in offline mode, or only show a black screen. I only use it because I work in remote areas and the offline mode works better than other apps(but let me be clear, it's still terrible, and these bugs have been present for YEARS). Do not recommend!!",0
It's a good app to have especially the Spotify premium it's great for me who I can rarely choose a song to listen to them unlimited skips work like a charm and the the no ads is even better in such of hearing the same ad over and over again,1
Brilliant,1
I hate how it plays a diffrent song sometimes and that its only avalable fr premium subscription but its a great app,1
"The best music service I have ever used. Spotify Premium is the only way I listen to music. At first it is like a big box if your favorite songs, but after you start filling your favorites list, and selecting artists you want to follow, it will blow your mind.",0
"It is an amazing app to cheer up your mood but resently when I tried to open the app, it didn't open. Thats the only problem.",1
I love loVE LOVE my Spotify. So many memories from the 90s rock playlists!!! And classic to new Metal ðŸ¤˜ðŸ’¯ðŸ¤˜,1
Love,1
Paid member. Will keep paying as long as Spotify keeps defending free speech. Should anything happen to JRE. My subscription ends immediately.,0
Great selection of music for all the family. Removal of always on display is disappointing.,0
It has my favorite songs and artist ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜,1
Superb music app. The best around ... by a mile!,1
Cant listen to any song that I want to pick,1
Very good and a lot of music,1
Its the best,1
Nice apps,1
It's so easy to access on and offline. Definetly recommend because of it being such a good app for music.,1
It was good so far but recently whenever I play a song it pushes me back to home screen without playing so yeah basically i am not able to play any songs there it's literally so annoying,0
Love the app. The only thing that bothers me is the new playlist system that was implemented. I can't play the songs in my playlist without it being mixed up with other songs that weren't added to the playlist. Now I usually open Spotify on my laptop because it doesn't have the annoying feature.,0
Smooth and clean what more to say,1
Love the selection and pay for premier but constantly have to Uninstall and reinstall the app. So glitchy.,0
I hate it everytime i click something it needs premium and the playlist im playing after the one song ended theres this random song thats gonna play even its not in my playlist.,0
This is the best music app for me I want have it no other way thank you Spotify,1
GOOD,1
"How do you turn it off when you're done listening,instead of just pausing???",0
"Jesus this is frustrating. Even though I force close this app several times, it immediately opens in my car and I can't get it to not connect. It is ridiculously frustrating. Borderline useless. I hope the engineers that worked on this get diarrhea and a cough for a week.",0
"This is trash, I CANT LISTEN TO MY SONGS!! I add something, it dosent work. PLS for the LOVE OF GOD don't download this game.",0
"It's super reliable and many choices for listening throughout. Although, the have taken down many epic and amazing JRE podcasts and for that alone, they suck. Otherwise pretty great.",1
There is an issue when using a gear watch 3 with it that you can't pause or skip the songs with out physical changing them in the app after the watch is disconnected and have to restart the phone to fix it,0
Getting more glitchy. Integration with HEOS is horrible and unstable. Please fix!,0
"can't play anything. it just continually skips, playing nothing in the process except the first 1 second.",0
"Latest update makes it hard to scroll through songs, especially if your driving......",0
"Easy to use, never has any problems.",1
"Hate it... Hate the suggested songs Whats the use of a playlist when you,they add they're own music. I dont wanna hear your random azz song mid workout.. uninstalles",0
"Free Spotify does nothing, using app for years, can't add music and if you go on to artist it days it's empty, disappointed",0
I love every playlist i choose....all the music i wanted to hear was there...,1
I have to echo what a lot of other users are saying. The app is great but the weird changes made recently-- I just don't see the benefit. Offline mode needs serious work. And why now do I have to click on artists or Playlist at the top of the screen when I go to my library instead of having buttons below where your thumb can reach easily? Makes zero sense. There should be an option to go to your artists by default when you open library. And of course the disappearing play bar is ridiculous.,0
Free got too much ad. I get ad every three song,0
Overall experience is good but app close after every 3-4 minutes while listening a songs.,1
"Won't load a searched playlist, loading symbol keeps spinning. Tried different accounts, clearing cache/data, reboots, nothing works.",0
Need more recommendations on contemporary hits and other matching hits. Quality of sound is superb.,1
At first it worked perfectly but now I cannot even log in,0
Why is spotify turning into YT? The amount of unofficial songs & people hacking spotify? Spotify needs to check up their security.,0
Solid app. Rarely crashes. Great features. Wish the free version wasn't shuffled,1
Hm awesome,1
Its not good when I'm offline I can't hear my favorite songs ðŸ™„ðŸ™„,0
"Spotify prompts us to get premium every 2 songs. So i thought.. yea it's worth it cus the song collection is massive. I got premium and now Spotify decides not to work. First it said ""no internet connection"" eventhough my connection was just fine. So i uninstalled and reinstalled it. But it won't even let me log in. Dissapointed cus it was such a good app before.",1
Love you Spotify....You are my everything!!!!,1
Spotify but freaky Friday is awesome,1
I Really Love What I Get From Spotify And It Has The Best Music That I Would Tell People To Join Spotify,1
It adds songs to my playlist that I never wanted on there. And the 30 minutes no ads thing is only about 10.,1
"I want 6 skip limit remove and let me choose the specific music to play without any other music I don't want to hear when I SPECIFICALLY chose the song I wanna play, and there is too many damn ads in this app, I'm not going to pay premium for this",0
Always my go to app through out the day. Has a little to many ads in a row but other than that it's perfect ðŸ˜,1
"great app, lots of songs.",1
The app is UNUSABLE after latest updates. Its way too slow to load and crashes. Was better before. UPDATE: Re-install did NOTHING. If you use your phone exclusively for Spotify it would be better to go with Youtube Premium or any other mobile music app. Update 2: Unable to Report Joe Rogans Podcast aa misinformation and unable to remove it from being viewed. Spotify is the worst music app.,0
Mainly good and great selection of artists. Don't.like all the adds and how the music just stops.,0
Greatest platform the is five star,1
I just downloaded this app because of their sponsorship with FC Barcelona and anytime they update it I will do my own because my favorite team in the world are suffering but Spotify is there to help myself too I will always support Spotify,1
I really liked the app but then there was WAY to many adds! I can't even skip to the song without it stopping me and telling me to get the premium!! If you don't have premium there is no way for you to Evan enjoy the app just use youtube!!!,1
I love music and this app makes it so easy to find any music I like. Worth every cent,1
Essentially a good app but there are certain flawd when we cast the app on pc browser and firetv Spotify. The songs don't stay in sync even though the internet connection is really powerful. Also many many songs don't have lyrics. Many songs used to have lyrics with them but then the lyrics disappeared. Otherwise it's good ... Better than all of the others.,0
Was good while it worked but stopped working on my phone hopefully future updates will fix,0
Nice app but having some issues okkokkasari app open cheyyagane back ayipothundi and malli two'days tarvata open cheste malli normal ga open avutundi soo konchem aa issue anto configuration cheskoni fix cheyyandi,0
"It is nice all of best songs are there, it is recommendable to other people",1
Updating my review. I still absolutely love this app and service. They recently just brought back their widget. My review would be five stars if they would bring back the scanning function for group sessions. It works better than sending links.,1
Why can I no longer SEE which song in the Playlist is playing???,0
It's one of the best music apps that they have on Google play store in my opinion,1
"Best app, best songs, sounds good , all information about singers , best service , continue.",1
Spotify is censuring open conversation podcasts because a small group of bad actors... unistalling because Spotify has no spine.,0
i just love spotify:),1
Good Variety and love seeing good takes on sports topics and listening to new artists I have never heard before.,1
So nice and better than all of the tunes,1
Ads is over inthe app stop first ads just a music player no ads player okey,0
I downloaded this app and it after 14 days it would not let me skip a song for more than 6 times a hour. It also would not let me pick a song. And it needs internet when in the description it says it does not need internet ðŸ˜‘ I think u should not get this app,0
App is good but one thing that please convert the kpop lyrics into English ( especially i want BTS songs must be in English lyrics than i can read easily)ðŸ’œ,0
Really slow loading times when you open the app,0
They remove all the good song. Stupidify!,0
Wonderful. Premium is wotlrth it. They will barage you with ads if not.,1
"Play menu suddenly stopped showing up, so now I can't control the song I picked, like pausing or skipping it. And when I lock my phone, it just stops playing.",0
This app is so cool and if I listan these song that I want to listen and it's has lots of playsit so I like it and my favorite singer is bts so I like to listening bts song and also English songs and I like to listening this song and this app is so amazing ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ in my opinion.,1
Simply amazing product.,1
The music is great and the ads are tallerable be Spotify adds songs to your playlist and you can't remove them and on top of that you only get 6 song skips a hour.,0
Great app but there are just too many ads in between songs.,0
This is the best app I can listen to my all kpop favorite songs,1
"Was loving the user experience until they updated the UI. I know it seems like a pretty thing to be annoyed about. Theyve put the buttons closer together and left empty spaces on the playback page making it really easy to what you want to hit. Also, would love it if they could add an undo button in case you accidentally remove a song from your liked songs playlist (which is really easy to do)",0
I really like it but I wish we could select the songs of our choice and skip the 1 we don like without premium,0
"This app sucks. You have limited amounts of skips and ads but that's not the problem. The biggest problem in my opinion is that they keep adding and playing suggested songs in my playlists and it's just annoying. Also it's impossible to turn off the shuffle on this app, unless you have a premium subscription.",0
Please please reduce the ads. They say 30mins and there is an ad again after 1 song. Not good. Spoils everything!! Just two things i wanna suggest:- I) add an option for Listen later just like Youtube has watch later option! II) Reduce the number of ads in non-premium! Edit: Do u even watch your customer reviews?,0
Spot on in every aspect of music industry,1
"Increasingly buggy. Can't rightly determine if you have internet or not, when other apps can. Main ""now playing"" UI breaks and gets stuck playing music. Notification bar gets stuck and won't clear despite nothing playing. Music presumptively resumes after other audio ends, despite explicit pause of Spotify beforehand. A mess, probably by design at this point. Default of ""shuffle"" baked into play button is just suspiciously ill-conceieved.",0
"The new update is very upsetting, u only have 6 times to skip the song and its per hour like how and why?? Considering that you can't even play the songs u liked.",0
Everything is great but advertisements. Why is it so frequent? It's so annoying.,0
Glitchy mess right now. Stops playing songs mid through even though they're downloaded. Pausing causes the app to set down ( if it will let me pause in the first place ) . Undownloads songs and app freezes comstantly,0
"It's absurd that Spotify keeps breaking for weeks now with the same issues. Songs randomly stop playing when the phone goes to sleep, songs keep playing after disconnecting my head phones, no tab showing the currently playing song or ability to pause, skip, or rewind songs, and the active song being a completely different song. I understand an app having the occasional issue, but it's been multiple weeks with the same issue now.",0
"Free version sucks, pay to play music version is my favorite music app.",0
"Whenever i skip a song, it goes hidden. Why? Just because i didnt want to listen to that song then, or i accidentally skipped it, i cant listen to it? And removing it from hidden is hard too. It doesnt work most of the time. I tapped a hidden song hundreds of times to get it unhiden, but that only worked twice. If i want to make it hidden, give me the option to do so, dont make it mandatory to skip the song. And i cant link to google account. I have just lost everything because of that. 0/10bad",0
This is too nice appBest app for music lovers,1
"Spotify is so bad atm, keep getting disconnected, control bar is not showing, randomly playing music which I can't stop unless turning off my phone ðŸ˜‘ ðŸ˜¤ I'm having issues like everyone else, if this doesn't get fixed, I unsubscribe this app asap.",0
"Its a very nice app.with good personalised mix and all. But my spotify is now showing ""no Internet connection "" when I have data and the network is working for other apps. I've updated it, but it's still the same. Please help!",0
"My score is actually 3 & 1/2 Stars but there is no 1/2 star option!!! Good App, not great........needs a little more work and then it would be a SOLID 4 Stars and on its way to 5!!",1
Love this app!! Easy to download & use in an instant!,1
"Can't really use cuz can't play songs that I like because it add songs for you, deing able to download 1-2 songs for free,light mode but like I'm gonna use it and make it easyer to find settings (mobile)",0
Best music and podcast app to use!,1
"The free version is ok, but it's far too many ads. But hey, you gotta break profit records every year, right? They also host some horrendous podcasts that love to disseminate misinformation. That alone is worth avoiding Spotify",0
Easy to use. Great selection of songs,1
Ad to music ratio is abysmal. Literally open the app and it plays the same 2 ads back to back okay thats cool then plays 2 songs and then I gotta listen to 6 ads? You're ads manager (whatever their actual worthless title is) should be locked in a room only listening to the ads. You're literally driving people insane till they purchase premium. Very scummy.,0
Ridiculous update. Don't pay for their premium until they bring back the now playing music bar both in app and in notifications. Where is the dislike button?,0
Good apps in music!,1
It's a really nice app to stream song you love but I didn't give 1 start out by mistake but because the ads are really annoying and stupid. Why do you even put ads Spotify?,0
It is too good I love this app only the problem is that without premium we can't download the songs . rest is god,1
Awesome collection just bit expensive,1
begging you guys to give back the music previews when you're adding songs to playlists. i add stuff to my playlists based on vibes and i also have trouble remembering song names please you're killing me how do i make sure it's the right version of the song without the previews,0
The reduce star is just because I can't see the lyric together with the song. I truly like how diverse the choices of songs are.,1
It's the best music streaming I've used so far and cheap,1
"Easy to use, has everything i search for and i listen to some pretty small metal bands, premium is great ðŸ‘Œ",1
The app is good allover but the problem is the advertisements which are really annoying have some shame Dev's!! And Than i will think to give rest of the stars,0
Apprehensive at first but the fact that they didn't cave to censorship(totally) is why I love Spotify. Free speech always!,1
I moved from ios to android and now i cant choose a song from a playlist? This is a rather large inconvenience. I cant pick and choose music or play something specific for my friends.,0
Out of 0 ðŸŒš very worst app Is not a Spotify addfy app ðŸŒš,0
Bug: doesn't show what it's playing and continues playing when I open up another media source,0
"They remove the equalizer options, that makes it more suitable for better experience I wish they could improve it. The previous one is better..",0
I Can't pause my music anymore I have to shut down the apps complethe options weightly and it doesn't show me what's playing currently anymore It used to be a cool app,0
my spotify stops playing in the middle of songs or podcasts. Iv googled it done literally everything they say on google to fix the problem. Still does it. Samsung s22,0
The new update sucks it will not let me play my music like that's the whole point of Spotify.,0
"I enjoy it. My only problem is, it turns on every time I get in my car without me starting it.",1
5 / 5 . Very Best. Sound quality is also very good. I hope spotify will rely just limited ad. Just like now all time. Thank you..ðŸ‘,1
Since the latest update the play and pause buttons disappear all the time.,0
Music access is fine but app is extremely buggy and often crashes,0
Amazing ,1
Best music app that I had used yet,1
It's the best music browser,1
"there seems to have been a decline in my control of music played. Also PAY THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE MUSIC. Other than that,it's pretty cool .",0
This app has the best features and is very much clear than the other music apps ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
"This is so good experience about the other music but the problem is I'm going to spotify premium to free skip but I can skip when your going to continue to skip, the skip has been stop and the skip is available when after the 6 hour. But spotify its so important for me because spotify it's my door to get out for vecna's world. Joke heheðŸ˜…",0
It was good I was on it 24/7 but it's newest update messed it up I can't listen to song I'm putting on it takes me to a completely different song and artistic do not recommend plz don't use it and I can't take put it on a loop so no it's lost all replay do not use,0
Why are you removing some songs from your application.,0
This is the best thing I ever ever seen in my intire life brooooo.,1
Great sound. Easy to use.,1
Always has been a good app most every song I've ever looked for has been here,1
Great app for music But you improve so one can listen offline â˜ºï¸,1
The TV ap and casting from phone to TV rarely ever works.,0
"I would rate lower but I cant, there are so many problems that spotify has from being non user friendly to not even being able to manage your songs, find songs, listen to the songs you want to without adds or interruption despite premium and more. Honestly I recommend using YouTube for your Playlist, sure it has some downsides but its better than this trash excuse for a song app.",0
After using this product I found the artist I wanted to listen to with ease Sounds like he is in the room with me Thank You so much,1
"Great for when you wanna turn off your phone and listen to music, unlike youtube -3-",1
I listened to 2 songs and the ad came 3 times!,0
"The app is great tho idk why but I don't have the canvas option so that's sad, but still 5stars. I also got the family premium so ya it's cool ðŸ¤Œ",1
"Would not open no matter what I tried, spent about 2 hours trying to fix it. :( It was pretty good when it did work.",0
Terrible ever since April 5th update keeps cutting out while I'm sitting still connected to wifi and data... also the controller has disappeared... get it together spotify as much as yall charge us get it together or in going to Google music,0
Excellent,1
I like Spotify but the new update made me mad bcs even when Im trying to play the songs I want it chooses random songs and when I'm shuffling it took me hours just to find that song. Please fix it,0
"It's really amazing and comfortable, I love it",1
"Dude what did you all do to your app?! The player at the bottom just vanishes sometimes and I have to close it. Half of my ""favorite artists"" I've never even heard of. When I'm listening to any album from certain genres and it ends, it plays the same songs afterwards every time. Songs I like, but used to a lot more, til they automatically came on all. The. Time. Was 5 stars until the last couple updates.",0
Best way to listen to the type of music I enjoy. Fantastic.,1
"The app is truly driving me crazy lately. It randomly pauses a lot, won't play from the home/lock screen, and when I do open it it won't actually show what is playing, which means I can't pause from the actual app. I have to close and completely restart the app only to have the issues repeat anytime I pause for more than 5 minutes (which I have to do often if I'm listening at work). I've un installed and reinstalled and am nearly at my wits end.",0
It's good but there's no canvas options for mobile please fix it,0
"Definitely useful at any point of time when awake with Spotify, spoilt for choice with soothing music. Also heard that Spotify is also going into web creation, so will be grateful if can get more info from anyone aware of this.",1
I love Spotify me always music â¤ï¸ðŸ’œ,1
"Actively hosts, promotes, and distributes covid misinformation. A shame I'll have to move to another service.",0
Very good been listening of this for 2 years highly recommendedðŸ‘,1
I love this app alot and I will recommend u guys to use this app and listen to your favourite songs. The best thing I like about this app is the playlist with we can make of our own and that's one my heart touching feature I lik about Spotify. Hope you enjoy Spotify music and podcast. Thank you â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ,1
Best app overall ....it sometimes has it glitches here and there but I wouldn't complain,1
"Confusing, hard to use.",0
Amazing app!!! I don't have to select songs after every 5 minutes during driving. It automatically play similar songs and very user friendly .,1
Affordable premium and good quality music,1
app is absolute junk any app is better i can't even select 1 song from an artist. again this app is junk,0
This app is good for listening to music every where,1
I like the app and the music but I don't like how we can't do almost anything with out premium. Like I cant repeat songs and other kind of random songs pop in when I'm listening to my playlist.,0
"Keeps crashing. Didn't used to do that, but now it happens all the time.",1
"Love the variety of music and the ability to create playlists with music i like. Don't really mind the ads (since i use the free version), but there are too many covid ads and ads for music that just plain sucks.",0
Using from 3 years except for some minor bugs everything works flawless,1
,1
Creating account is so annoying. Errors everywhere ðŸ˜‘,0
"Super slow loading of phone app. And no, nothing's wrong with my connection, and nothing's wrong with my android. Every other app in my phone works perfectly fine, but it takes forever just to open library or searching some artists/songs. Things simply won't load, and it used to work fine too!",1
I've heard of Spotify for years but never thought of getting it until I accidentally deleted all my music off my phone. Spotify has been a savior when it comes to my music (I use it to help with my anxiety and calming down),0
Spotify is the best music streaming app I've ever used wow,1
Idk what id do without this cuz pandora puts to many ads and soundcloud jus dont hit like spotify does so thanks for being free and easy and having all my songsðŸ˜­ðŸ˜•ðŸ™,0
Ads are a little much but other than that it's great,1
Unparalleled music streaming. There is a reason spotify dominates the market.,0
The only music streaming app worth using.,0
Soooo lagi,1
my experience before with Spotify was great i got to enjoy the music i like but lately i can't play any songs on the app bcs it always says I'm offline even tho my phone has an internet connection I even uninstalled and installed it again hoping it'll be okay but instead worst did happen i can't now log in bcs it says im offline tho im not even the links they send to me don't work pls fix this,0
Amazing! Music & Podcast App! Spend about 8 hours a day on it!,1
I love Spotify with all my â¤ï¸,1
Fine l would like to have more songs with tyric and cords,0
Great app love the music have the best,1
I've had Spotify since college and the update is nice,1
Very bad application here is no way to play default player,0
Perfect,1
Adds ,1
"So easy to use, I love the simplicity of playlist building, adding to queue, dowloading and organizing!",1
I came to Spotify from another streaming app because I had a lot of problems with the functionality of the other app. Here everything just works and the search is much better too.,0
Nice app always plays my favourite songs automatically,1
"I love Spotify but the thing is that my playlist only allows me to play on shuffle mode. It doesn't let me choose what songs on my playlist I wanna hear at the moment and I understand that premium is totally the opposite but it annoys me because I just want to enjoy my music on Spotify instead of having to pay to be fully satisfied. Other than that, spotify has always been my go to and I love it",1
Spotify has introduced me to so much great music based on what I already listen to. Every music lover should have this app!,1
"Until You Spotify don't do smt about Lisa's Money on your app,there is no chance I'm giving u above 1 star!!!! GET AFECTED U BIOTCH....",0
In devotional section why kannada song not available ? I'm uninstall this app. One u added let me know.,0
Spotify has been the best music app i have ever encounterd the app consume less data and it is very enjoyable,1
Creates Happiness and Happiness Fulfilled.An e compendium of Music that Satisfies your desire for Music.,1
Nice app and better music options compare to jio music.,1
"I've been bored with Spotify playing the same small list of songs for months, somtimes many, many months. Even across different stations. Now, with the Joe Rogan controversy, I'm tossing them out. Bye bye Spotify! You were great in the beginning, but got greedy...",0
You have the best music Spotify is Awesome,1
Great app and finding music is excellent.,1
"I love the user-created playlists and the emails you get from your favorite artists for upcoming concerts or merch. Definitely worth the money for Premium - the free version has so many ads, it's unusable.",0
This service is great but the app crashes and causes the app I am using to crash.,0
Very nice,1
Very good but its annoying when they add songs to your PlayStation that you don't want,0
I've had to lower my rating because lately the app is getting worse and worse. You seem to prioritise minimal UI over functionality. Main issue I'm having is that my playlist which has 48 hours worth of music in it will start repeating songs an hour or 2 in to playing through BT speakers (yes repeat is off) and then often switches to playlist radio which I don't want!,0
"The app is broken. I've been using it for years with little to no issues but right now its constantly stopping in the middle of tunes and podcasts. I can't use the play menu to stop or skip ahead, it's simply not appearing. Something happened in a recent update that completely messed up the usability of the application. I hope this gets fixed soon or I'll just unsub because right now its basically unusable.",0
Easy to use and very wonderful,1
My downloads to my SD card get lost every time I reboot my phone.,0
New App. SO far so good after 6 months will add +* PS. Best of all types of music!,1
It is a good app i love the app but the ads are annoying,0
"A lot of errors from each update, they change things that actually work well and the algorithms are poor.",0
Spotify premium is a good service. Spotify the free version is literally unusable. The app runs just fine,0
"Recently Spotify had been. Playing up I can't listen to more that 3 songs before the app closes down completely not sure what's going on, I'm upto date with payments and stuff it's only Recently started acting up",0
Unable to download music and yes I do have a premium account.,0
Good quality music quick and easy,1
This app is the best music app. Hope they don't switch on us for worst. Big up Spotify,1
Sucks when trying to play music in another device google asisten and play the same in my cellphone,0
YouR NeVR AlOnE Best of 1 of MiNe,1
"Like a lot of other reviewers, I've been pretty happy with the app, however the recent glitches where the music won't stop playing & the now playing tab keeps disappearing is quickly getting to be more trouble than it's worth. I've had to force stop the app at least half a dozen times just today. Please fix these issues.",0
Best app for songs,1
"There are no downloads and still takes 6.5 GB. DO YOU USE STORAGE FOR LIKING PLAYLISTS? The only way to remove this problem is to delete all DATA (Not just cache) that includes deleting the account. Why would I want to do that? There's not even enough space for an updation. PREMIUM EXPERIENCE IS GOOD hence the 2 stars, but it hinders other activities on the device. DELETING CACHE NEVER HELPS HERE. This is my first and last trial of spotify premium. Also, TERRIBLE shuffles and discoveries.",0
Love this app. I have had it for several years and it has its down and I have never doubts,1
"Good and all but the playlist update is very annoying, Wheni go to one of my fav songs ky plays a diffrent song.",0
Easy to use and free services are also very nice,1
Been using this app for as long as I can remember and all I can say is that this is the best music streaming app that I've ever used. Been a premium user since 2019 and was satisfied with the benefits. Never encountered any problems or whatever in this app so I'm very happy. I absolutely love the Blend feature right now cause I was able to match with my friends' music tastes. This has served as my comfort since I learned to use it. So this is a 5/5 because I'm being generous lol.,1
Has a music lover. This app is good and huge collection of music but one thing is about adds .Spotify broadcast same adds repeatedly please change adds after one by one and make some long gape between two adds it's comes quickly soo please solve itðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—,1
Fantastic music any time,1
I love this app it allows me to listen to all my favorite music.,1
"I don't know what happened this past month with the updates but the app is terrible. Freezes, stops by itself, completely unusable.",0
"Using enhance option reduced my playlist length! Spotify agents are a bunch of idiots. Nimmala B. said Spotify automatically saves in SD card and then to internal storage. This was his solution for my playlist length problem. I showed app screenshot where Spotify is saving in internal storage and not in SD card, it also had tickmark next to internal storage. Do Apple iPhones have an SD card? No! Then, how will Spotify save automatically in Apple iPhones which don't have SD cards!",0
Great when it's working. Occasionally needs to be deleted and reinstalled to fix glitches.,1
"Used to like this aap. But now i don't like this aap as i am unable to listen to my favorite songs, it is added to a playlist and is not playing solo , also when i tried to return to song in shuffle list it was not working.",0
While being a great music app it's expensive for the underclass,0
Its good but i dont have lyrics on my acount yet i have it updated,1
Good morning ,1
It's good but its frustrating when it won't play my liked songs list. Plays every other playlist but that.,1
Music is great and so many songs to choose,1
Brilliant and very Enjoyable everyday ðŸ˜€,1
"I really loved Spotify. Been on Premium for long time. I could download songs, podcasts etc so I could listen offline. However recently all these are gone. What happened? Why I have to be online to listen to my downloaded music? When I'm on long haul flight I cant listen to my favourite songs anymore. Very disappointing. :-(",0
Really aggravated when you're listening to classic country with family and then No Filter by ASTAR starts playing.,0
It's far better than other music applications. ðŸ˜Best experience ever!,1
Excellent. No adverts henceforth no song interruptions.,0
"Spotify is the best for me I m really happy to have this app all music available at the tip of your fingertips, tjovitjo",1
Sometimes the song currently playing can be paused thru the app or thru the notifications when i pull down. Sometimes i have to close the app in order to stop the play. Sometimes the music stops for no apparent reason,0
"Since the update the music keeps stopping 3 times a song, truly thinking of cancelling my premium. As not worth it's weight n e more. ðŸ˜ž",0
"Great app, love how I don't get to watch any ads ðŸ’…ðŸ»",1
"Doesn't have a real range of artists. Too many conventtional, mainstream, performers. I can't find any underground or indie acts that I've long been familiar with.",0
"The best music streaming platform , have been using it for a year plus now and I have no regrets ðŸ’œ",1
"It was good, but then after only like 2-3 months it said my free trial was over (which i wasnt informed of the fact its a TRIAL). After that it didn't just give me alot of ads, but it made it to the point when i listened to my liked songs playlist, it wouldn't even play them. It would just play some random song that wasn't even liked by me. Wouldve given less stars but I'm being nice.",1
"This used to be my favorite app. In the last 2 yrs it skips, crashes, and rarely ever plays a half hour of nonstop music even when the ad says it has completed for that service. I regularly use multiple apps at a time, and if I'm using spotify, it almost always crashes everything. Permissions are on for what it needs, and it still doesn't work. It's tiring. Plus when a song no longer can be played for the app due to lack of rights or change in ownership, there's no update; the song appears as 0.",0
POOR CONTROL FEATURES Would it seriously kill you guys to add a BLOCK feature? I would rather jab rusty nails into my ears and eyes repeatedly then have certain podcast artists recommended to me. I should not have to follow and listen to garbage politically bs just so I can rate it as Garbage,0
"Something is wrong. They claim a short video advertisement will play then I can enjoy music. However, their video doesn't play so I have no music, nothing, just a dumb frozen page. And when I Uninstaller it somehow remembers me and right back to an add that won't play.",0
Too expensive quality not as high as other apps for same price,0
"uh, hello. i really love your app but i havent got my spotify wrapped yet? it should've been on my account. i listened to many artists, have a lot of genres so please put spotify wrapped on my account.",0
"Constantly crashes, restarts what I'm listening to, and frequently makes me have to restart my phone. Every new update is a new problem. Absolutely embarrassing for a company of this size.",0
"Its great listening to it on desktop, but when it comes to the phone, u can't play the playlist in order. It will always be shuffled and you cant go back to the song before the one u would be listening to right now. The rest is great, I enjoy using Spotify a lot :)",1
Best app for songs ,1
"I have been a Spotify customer for 5 years. I loved the app and Spotify was my go to choice. After 4 years of Spotify premium my membership randomly cancelled. My account was softlocked by Spotify and I can't log into a free version of my account. I tried repaying with 4 cards that all have money and even bought a prepaid. Spotify declined every single one. When I changed it to a free account it deleted everything. My playlists, liked songs, podcasts. Everything.",0
I dont like your playlists and have turned off. Either play what I request or I will get my music elsewhere.,0
What's wrong I can't take student premium it again n again ask to verify me after that blank pages occurs what's wrong that Sheerid ???,0
"Easy to use, what I want to listen to.",1
This is the bestest app i oftenly use this during my office works,1
Excellent music selections. I love my gym jams Playlist,1
Like people have been saying something is going on w the app. The play/pause bar is disappearing. Whenever I open the app and try to select Liked Songs or another Playlist it won't open them. The glitches are seriously annoying,0
"I cannot see anything when I go to my library, all my playlists are gone. The app is unusable.",0
Best music application ever,1
It is quite good. It can get 5 stars but the only problem is that whenever I want to read any song's lyrics it just says no internet connection but it plays all the song perfectly. I even tried reinstalling it but it didn't work. It can be the perfect app only if you solve this problem. It is a request to please have a look at my problem and try to solve it as fast as possible. Otherwise it is the best app that can ever be.,1
It is best website for listening the music I use many websites like gana Spotify is best website to use for listening the music,1
The spotify app is amazing! I can listen to my favourite music whenever I want for free.,1
Very good! Have been using it for almost 2yrs now! Only Problem is ------>ADS!!!,0
I used to love this app but to download music offline sucks. I downloaded music offline multiple of times and when my phone was cut off. It never work. What's the point of a feature you can't use.,0
So today bug is I have no play or pause or anything to stop music. I can select a song and it plays. But I can't pause it or anything. Lol,0
Enjoy listening to this daily. Now I need to store fewer mp3 tracks on my pc and phone. Love how versatile it is,1
Please!!! Fix!!! It wont stop playing I have to Uninstall it everytime just to turn the music off soo annoying!!!,0
Only advertisement for our premium,0
"Very frustrating, the app constantly claims I'm offline when I have good reception/wifi connection. Makes it a pretty bad experience. No problems with other apps or browser. Just Spotify.",0
Shut up with the ads,0
I really love the fact spotify comtains the lyrics for most of its library without taking me to a completely different page. Plus im allowed to make my own custom playlists unlike pandora. I also applaude Spotify for standing up for free speech.,1
"Been using for 6 years+, never fails to disappoint me.",1
I like that it knows the type of music I like and offer good suggestions on discovering new music,1
Can't pick your songs if you don't pay. May as well use YouTube music if I have to head ads. At least I can choose my songs.,0
"Used to be fine, now it won't even show the play/pause bar. Only way to stop my music is to force closed. When connect to Bluetooth it won't show the song etc. It force closes it self almost every other song. I can reinstall and it'll maybe work for an hour.",0
If any playlist on very fastly nice ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—,1
Woww spotify is so beautiful you can see all internal musical song in spotify app so you download now ðŸ˜‡,1
Offline mode toggle needs to be on first page. It takes far too long to toggle from the settings menu. Like heading thru deadzones line elevators. Too many clicks for something I need four times a day minimum.,0
Spotify app is getting worse day by day. It troubles a lot if you don't have a premium account. No facilities for free account holders. It's ads are so annoying. They pop up after almost every song. Spotify should remember that if it can create problems for non premium users but putting more ads non premium users can also show Spotify nightmares by giving one star rating,0
It's pretty good but when your a free listener u get limited skips and u can't stay in the same Playlist like for example if I'm listing to boy with uke three songs later I get a whole new different song so can u please fix this?,0
Best application for listening song,1
"To all the people tryna complain about ads, don't buy a Starbucks (or fastfood, that extra snack, etc) tomorrow. Now pay for premium which you will enjoy for longer. Repeat every month. Enjoy life. I'm willing to bet half of y'all pay ~80 for a tv box a month, which you rarely use. If music is part of your daily routine, pay for premium. It's worth it.",0
"Very good music player as expected, also has lyrics which I love",1
"Very wide variety of music, however if not on premium ads are shockingly frequent",1
like,1
the best way to listen to music. reccomends songs for me so i can find music i wouldnt have been able to find otherwise. also makes it extremely easy to share playlists with others,1
Barely works and it is making me question why I keep paying for premium. How does it have no internet connection while connected to WiFi. If I could give zero stars I would. Absolute garbage of late.,0
"It won't play anything but playlists, and it won't let me play my songs",1
"Just. Amazing. But I gotta warn you tho, you can't really enjoy this app to the fullest with just the free version, the update sucks, really showed how eager Spotify is for peoples money, because of the update, I had no choice but to buy premium, boooo hoo, overall though, 4.3 stars,",0
Brilliant have many songs and features,1
Many of the problems with playback and crashes haven't happened recently.,0
Please fix the latest update. I cannot play any song. It keeps on crashing once I click play button. Device: VIVO V21 Location: PH,0
Apps nya bagus tp utk premium nya masih mahal  lyric lagu korea  cina tidak ada text nya ,1
I love Spotify! ðŸ˜ It's the only one I use.,1
Love the service but the mobile app keeps freezing then not allowing me to pause or anything. Have to restart my phone to get it to work again. Incredibly annoying,0
The only reason why I give it 4 and not 5 is because it adds to many songs to my playlist and it doesn't give me enough skips to skip them so I get stuck listening to songs that I don't like and that I never even heard,0
"It's a good app and love it, but I hate how many ad's there are.",1
Super,1
Currently playing button keeps disappearing. Or is that a new feature? Lol.,0
Amazing technology and sound.,1
Perfect music player application ever I had.,1
Love all the options of music. It was easy to understand and great experience,1
Why has the bar below disappeared meaning I cant start or stop the music?? Please fix this.,0
forces me to listen to other songs even though i checked an option not to.,1
Brilliant music ðŸŽ¶ and very enjoyable,1
I really like this even though there un skipped able ads I'm used to it really I can even song sof encanto! We don't talk abou brunoOoO!,1
"Switched from Google/YouTube music to this and have to say it's so underwhelming. Really buggy app, takes ages to open, cuts out randomly, if signal drops to half then music stops. Can't see what the hype is about at all.",0
It's easy to use and complete content,1
Everything is premiumi cant understand this app,1
I love Spotify. I just wish it were a little less expensive. The trial period definitely gets you hooked.,1
"Spotify is wonderful and there is almost no problem with it, but I would constantly have suggested songs pop up while I am listening to my liked playlist. I find it extremely irritating if I have to use all my skips to skip songs that are not on my playlist and songs in a language I can not understand. I have disabled the autoplay function but it seems that is not enough. I would only recommend Spotify if you plan to use Spotify premium.",0
I think it's a great app if you want to get a playlist set up to your liking and can make multiple on and also it has premium witch is unbelievable with it's prices because it's so cheap for such a good app that has so much potential. :),0
I hate the upgrade! You can't turn the songs off!,0
"Worst music app ive ever used, only allows 6 skip songs per hour and auto populates your playlists with suggested songs instead of what you want to listen too...that you cant remove or skip.",0
"Stop updating the app and making it worse. I'm writing this review because they updated the currently playing song banner to a ""new"" version. Except this new version is buggy AF on my pixel 2 xl when the old one worked fine. I have to end the app and reopen it to fix it almost every time I'm using the app. Stop making the user experience worse in the name of user experience Update: new phone and now the bugginess is in the lock screen ""now playing"" notif.",0
"Even the free software is very good, I just love this app, thanks to the people who created this app! ðŸ˜ƒ",1
All most all songs are available. ...... happy ðŸ˜Š,1
"Usually I like Spotify and even use Premium, but lately, every time there is an update, the apl crashes as soon as I start playing a song, which really makes the app very useless. Mostly this issue is resolved after some time, but it keeps coming up. Without this problem, I would give Spotify at least 4 stars. Please fix it.",0
It's a bit weird on the Google pixel - takes ages to load download podcasts when offline and recently random songs are being added.to.my playlists and they just randomly start playing,0
Great music with informative and educational podcasts.,1
"An app which is recomendable to everyone, makes your life enjoyable and fun to the fullest of the day..",1
i like it but i cannot see the lyrics i dot kniw why but can u fix this,0
"Like the app but it's become buggy lately! It doesn't run in the background consistently when the phone is locked (even though it has the permission) also sometimes it takes too long for it to load the song, even on high speed internet. My phone is Google Pixel 3a. ******** Update in summer 2022: The problem is solved. Thanks!",0
All the things work on premium,1
This is worst...it shows too many ads..although it shows that after one ad there won't be any ads for the next 30 minutes but if you close the app and reopen it...it will again show you ads..just here to criticize it for being so greedy for earning money by showing ads..whereas ....its primary function is to let us listen song peacefully rather it ruin our mood sometimes by showing irrelevant ads..this app literally forces you to buy their subscription,0
Spotify where do i begin I just started using this a few weeks ago and i didnt know that i had prenium for 2 weeks but then all of a sudden it now adds its own songs and its on shuffle play Dont use this unless u dont care about what i just said i hope they change this,0
"Damn it if u don't take premium these ppl keep begging by putting 30 sec ads between every 2 songs!! If u take premium then it's good ,if u want to listen for free them don't use this",1
They keep updating and seem to understand the customer's needs. There is so much more to hear in their use of radio stations and I can discover new and forgotten sounds. The linking to speakers is so easy. More than Amazon's own app!! And that is when using echos,0
App performance is good but one thing which make this app not good is a lot of Ads and it is soo irritating so I am disliking it,0
One of the best app and please stop adds and we want lyrics for all songs ðŸŽµ â¤,1
Fix your app its garbage water Constant issues when app wont close properly and reload,0
"I don't know what happened in the most recent update but it's excruciatingly frustrating. It stops midsong, it doesn't allow me to control through my phone, it doesn't stop playing if I go to another app that has audio like it did before, it won't stop playing when I press to pause audio on my headphones, it asks me to allow Bluetooth even thought it's already allowed and it keeps asking me after I've clicked the affirmation *multiple time.*",0
Really nice app. C cool place where I can find almost all my favourite musicians and podcasts online without having to spend hours searching for any streaming service available online like i used to do before and the speed is also good. Maybe a suggestion is if you could also include the audiobook section for major bestsellers it would be great. Thanks again.,1
"Used all of our data despite not using the app. Just having it on in the background. I've made the switch to other services, the app will just burn through data if not kept in offline mode",0
I love to listen music in Spotify its add irritating me now adaysinspite of this its good,1
"Music is the most therapeutic way, of me just getting through life. I have had my Spotify membership for years. It is my gift to myself every day. I'll never give up my Spotify!",1
"The most recent update turned the ""Download using cellular"" option back on without any notice and it just drained my entire month of data in 3 minutes to redownload all my downloaded content. Very displeased.",0
"I paid last month for Premium Family & my wife. Unfortunately she past away two weeks ago. Love the music, but I'll keep her phone too for when family come 5o visit.",0
Spotify is #1 in the world ðŸŒ.,1
"Since last update the queue system is broken only lets you add one song to a queue and will frequently bug out and hide controls for currently playing podcasts and makes it impossible to pause it from the app. I dont know how you managed to ruin your qrues system more the YouTube music buy this is embarrassing, if this isn't fixed by next billing date I'll be forced to move platforms so that I can actually listen to my music and podcasts",0
"I love the app so much, best music app I be ever used. But all the playlists made for me to discover new songs by Spotify are filled with my liked and downloaded songs, so I take away 1 star for that.",1
"It's a good app overall, but I can't view songs in albums of artists. Edit 05/29/22: Ever since I got my new phone (Samsung galaxy a20) none of my Playlists pop up or my liked songs. My music is unplayable. Recently it started saying that I was offline when I wasn't. I am extremely upset with the situation because music is my happy place and now I have to use Amazon music which isn't as good as this app. When I looked to see if my phone was compatible it said it was. So what's with that.",0
I like how it allows you to have 5 accounts so your family can have their own personal Spotify,1
The best music app till now ...,1
Neverminds,1
"So much frustrating app, too many ads ðŸ˜‘ Just moving on other app",0
"Please make it so we are able to refresh videos, it's annoying when all you get is black screen on phone, and I do have a good connection when watching them. Otherwise everything else seems great.",1
"The app is good. I can play all the songs I want. And no adds, the songs continuing to play.",1
The app crashes and Is slow on sooo many ocassions . For a tech giant their main product kind of sucks now.,0
Amazing experience but too adds,1
Very good its fast and very helpful when searching for songs we want,1
Best music app period,1
Sucks always buffering and it eats up my data unlike Pandora. Fast forward to song in the middle of the song I'm listening to.,1
I love it,1
Nothing More Than The Best! Thanks fir all the Music l Can Handle....,1
Wonderful app been using it for years like everyone else I've been experiencing issues with glitches and songs stopping and restarting can you please fix this issue,1
Super wow app,1
Amazing,1
I wrote this a bad review because every time I make a playlist on Spotify they add different songs and add songs to my playlist.,0
A lot of fun enjoy listening to good Ole music,1
What is the point of making an app where you can listen music when you have to be charged MONEY to be able to play THE SONG THAT YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO? Turning off shuffle mode and playing an album or playlist that should be played in the same order it was supposed to be listened to shouldn't be a PREMIUM FEATURE. There is no reason for me/someone to use this app when they can't even be able to listen to an album/playlist in the order it was ment to be listened to WITHOUT ADDING SONGS ON THEM.,0
"I'm not sure if anyone else has faced this problem, but there is one thing that has been annoying to deal with. So I'm listening to a song that's further down my playlist and then I go and leave the app for a bit and pause my music. I go back wanting to continue where I left off, only to find Spotify has resetted my playlist back to the top. The bottom bar shows the song I had on, but now I have to scroll all the way to where I left off to continue. It's so annoying, and I hope they fix this.",0
I hate the ads but I can't buy premium because I'm poor,0
"Such a glitchy app, lags like crazy (displays incorrect songs frequently due to this). Expected so much more from a brand like Spotify. Update 5/2022 the network connectivity of this app is dire, have to force it to close constantly when travelling for it realise there's a connection - even get the no network connection whilst the app is working and connected. As I've said before, expected so much more from this brand when actually the experience is really poor. Have to reboot to see now playin",0
"What happened to Spotify? It used to work very well but since recent updates it's a disaster. The song currently playing bar dissappears so I can't control what's playing, the music keeps randomly stopping all the time. Very annoying, please resolve",0
"This has been a great app until I experienced not being able to see my queue nor edit it. Note: I'm on premium. Also, I tried online suggestions that might help fix the problem. Unfortunately, it is still a problem.",0
Super ,1
Its arguably the best music streaming app. The ads are annoying but I can tolerate them. The thing that I and many others hate though is that the shuffle feature isn't actually random and favors popular songs and plays them A LOT more often then less popular songs from the playlist. Please fix this spotify,0
Still people cant see the lyrics in spotify on some devices. And the app seems like laging at some places or the animation speed would have not been nice,0
Have been a Spotify just for over a decade. Need I say more!?,0
"the recent update was a trash! lots of app crashes and bugs. I've been planning on switching to apple music because of spotify's stupid user interface, loads of bugs and app crashes",0
Just great,1
Been an absolute train wreck of an app lately. Maybe use some of your billions in profit to pay some decent UX designers and developers,0
Love it,1
Gotta use for rogan. Music player song radio is random. Pandora does a better job and the song now playing tab is always gone. Gotta restart app to get it back. DO BETTER! Focus on the product not the artists views.,0
Its so good. so many music. omg my life,1
Worked great until a software update. Now all the Playlist on my phone appear empty and Spotify claims it can't connect to the internet whenever I use search to fine music...,0
Enjoying the variety of music.,1
Amazing! Love it! â¤ï¸,1
"Perfect app , Though i can't afford the premium... It's still a good app it's having alot of songs which are f2p and the ads aren't soo annoying it's bearable so yeah this a is an excellent app",1
I just wanna listen to 1 song. It keeps taking me to Playlist of song that isn't what I search,0
Such a interesting experience in music.,1
The lyrics feature used to work when it was in beta but it doesn't anymore and I want it on phone to learn the songs from the Silent Hill 4 soundtrack,0
When I use singing apps I want to listen to the music I WANT TO but when I make a playlist it plays songs I did not even put into it it's annoying â”Œ(Ëµà¼Žàº¶Ù„ÍŸà¼Žàº¶Ëµ)â”,0
"Can someone explain ,why am I not getting the lyrics with songs, I've reinstalled it many times ?? à¼Žàº¶â€¿à¼Žàº¶",0
"I have to log out and sign back in every time the app is closed in order to access my ""Liked Songs"" playlist, otherwise it only shows the few 2-3 I've liked from my desktop, but not the remaining 500 others I literally listen to on the regular...",0
"Sound quality seems better than YT, I guess coz Spotify only streams audio, not video. Also, I am constantly surprised by the selection - I purposely search artists that I think are too obscure or too unknown for this popular streaming site and lo and behold Spotify has them. Sometimes I'll search an obscure artist and Spotify will suggest albums that I've never heard of! From dusty vinyl classics to the latest underground sounds, check Spotify.",1
I love this app and its flexibility. The search feature crashes the app on my old 2016 LG Tablet unfortunately.,0
Spotify is good app but the main fault of giving two satr is that he don't play those song who choose me and play a rondom song plzz spotify do work on this fault I am done with this fault,0
Great access to favourite tunes past and present. Easy to use so far.,1
"This is the best app for listening to music, like i can't live without Spotify. i would defenetly recommend downloading it and getting premium.",1
This app keeps on taking me to other songs i dkn't even want to watch whenâ‚© i press the play button it plays another song please fix this!,0
I love this app here all song come out english urdu hindi punjabi everything i give 5 stars to this app,1
I always enjoy the good music,1
Frequent bug fixes are appreciated!,1
"I hate this with all my heart this app is sooooo stupid because you have a limit to how many songs you can skip and I'm just trying to listen to the songs I LIKED and it just decides to give a similar song if I like a song I will like it of not don't give me those songs I can't even listen to like 3 songs before it gives me a ""similar"" recommendation it is sooo stupid and I thought that I selected a setting to make it stop and it didn't Spotify on phone is so stupid",0
"Spotify subscriber, duo premium. Awesome Awesome music app this is. We love it Highly recommended on subscription.",1
It's great you get to listen to the music that you like and whit out interruptions,1
Great app to enjoy music,1
Spotify app bhut hi gjb h,1
App keeps letting songs play for 10 seconds when try to select and then stops. It diesnt recognise it's in playback mode (best way I can describe). You have to turn phone off and then on to reset and make it work again. Such a pain as you cant even just close and re open app to reset. Incredibly infuriating.,0
"The Spotify version 8.7.30.1221 is very bad , you all have put this play pause button into the left , earlier it was in the middle part, please make it correct",0
Pretty bad almost unusable... Podcasts cant play.,0
One of the best ðŸ‘Œ Music ðŸŽ¶ APP ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥,1
Too many ads,0
bwcause it other song that i do not pick and it play other song and i not know how i go back to the sony i play it is keep add music i not want,0
Why same liked songs list getting downloaded everyday? Otherwise it can't be played offline. Then what is the use of paying money every month? It should be downloaded only one time. Please improve it,0
When I try to play my playlist it starts playing random songs that I dont like and are not in my playlist and now I can't listen to songs by my favourite creator without hearing songs I never asked for.,0
The songs stop midway! I have to click pause and play for the song to continue! I am subscribed to premium so why is even this happening? Please fix this!,0
"Anytime I wanna listen to music even when I'm offline, Spotify is right there on my home page and I only have important things on my home page it's basically the ð”¹ð”¼ð•Šð•‹d(ï¿£â—‡ï¿£)b",0
Don't like the new update to the playlist,0
It's a great app to listen to music on but there is way to many ads,0
"Playbar on my android has been disappearing or not working for days now. You'd think Spotify would rush through a fix for a major problem like this, before people started bailing.",0
Good app with little interruptions,1
Great app. Works well and connects well with google devices.,1
I have to keep updating the app. The music can't be controlled. I have no idea what song is playing. The app was great at first now that I pay for it it is not. Pandora is old but it is always reliable. I have to switch back.,1
Talk about the best app ever you deserve to listen to that inner rockstar...... You can unwind from life hereðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
Excellent choices in music based on my tastes,1
I have been using spotify for many years and never complained before. But it has been a month or so that I keep having problems with it. Main issues at the moment : -Music shopping in a middle of the song -not being able to see what is playing,0
I love spotify but the new update caused it on my phone to play songs but not show at the bottom of screen and unable to skip the song unless reshuffled. Therefore I delete multitasking and try again and it works. Very irritating.,0
"Occasionally, the app freezes or shuts down. I also don't appreciate the censorship of certain podcasts. Still one of the better streaming apps out there.",0
It keeps on saying 14 days to use then brings me back to the login page over and over same with ps4.,0
"I do love the app, however, sometimes whilst listening to a podcast it stops randomly, then says the podcast is played/completed and starts playing another one ?? Please fix this",0
"This update is terrible! I really Can't listen to podcast this way, there's now way to reach the one that's playing",0
Play at disappears randomly and frequently. Don't care to reproduce error and record error.,0
"Awesome app, finding new music is never been easier!",1
Very interactive up with a variety of music,1
"Recent update broke the music controlls. Sometimes Spotify decides you aren't allowed to stop the music anymore. You can CHANGE it, but never stop. Hopefully some poor developer is working to fix the problem.",0
Premium is the best! Best paid music app you can get,1
"I use premium, app crashes alot when i open it, seems to only do it for JRE podcast.",0
"Why just you don't play tge song i want to hear, evrytime i look for a specific song i have to hear some other irrelevant playlist.",0
It's Dope Spotify music on my finger tips keep up The good work,1
When i downloaded Spotify app it was working very nice and smoothly now it's showing loading and displaying the message that it is taking much time than usual.Please check your internet connection. I don't know why? Please check this issue,0
"It would be great if this app could play music. It constantly stops for no reason, the playback notification disappears, and I just see ""Spotify is trying to play."" It also will sometimes continue playing when the notification has disappeared, leaving no way to pause music.",0
"Horrible app, you cant play songs, when you do it just doesnt work, though the ads are not too bad, would rather use youtube because i can CHOOSE what song i want to play, absolute L",0
"You people are full of sht I select a song and you play your own song, making it impossible for me to play a song that I want",0
Good to hear from you and thanks for the songs and joy :),1
"Just be careful you dont get scammed. They had me update my payment method and signed me up for a new plan without my knowing it - I thought i didnt have anything new selected, but apparently not. Its not about the few dollars i lost, its about what that behavior says about this company.",0
Easy and versatile,1
The app is great. There a few reallly old songsbi just can't seem to find on it.,0
No issues . No glitch. Can find music most wouldn't listen to .,1
Always works and so nice to make favorites lists. I play my Iris Whistle along with some great tunes.,1
Spotify is changing the way we listen to music. Keep up with hard work. Best mobile app ever!,1
I love this app starting to build up my own playlists,1
"My go to music app everytime, love the music but I've never checked out the podcast,5 I'll be sure to give it a try but",1
Would be 5 stars but Spotify keeps adding annoying songs to my playlist I dont like and wont let me remove them.,0
It's really good but I wish more songs were available. There is a huge variety but there are certain songs missing...,0
Spotify used to offer the best musical experience. Now they're more interested in misinformation campaigns.,0
"Ok app, but there is currently a bug with my ""good morning/good afternoon"" headed of the homepage in which it refuses to update. This is despite several deletions of the app on all devices, and clearing of all caches/storage too. I enjoy Spotify but until this bug is fixed I will be pretty upset :(",0
"Great, love it, has majority of things I'd like to listen to.",1
Nice aap,1
It was great until this new update I can't listen to any of my liked songs and random songs are appearing that I don't even like.,1
The stability is terrible after the latest update. It's been 12 days now and there still isn't a fix.,0
"I've reinstalled the app twice. I've created a whole new account. No matter what I do, I cannot get podcasts to play. Aldo your music streaming is complete garbage. I listen to one song and you hit me with 5 ads.",0
Best app but I think spotify should add karako of all song in app for better singing experience. .... Over all app is best for song If you take paid verson your experience is more majedarr. That's all form my side ...,0
Spotify has been a really helpful platform where I can stream music for absolutely free!! The quality is top notch and every song in the world can be found on this app. You can even listen to your friends playlists and have a great time listening to your favourite music. Premium definitely unlocks a new world. 100% recommended app.,1
It is the best music listening app even if you don't have spotify premium you can fade into songs the audio quality is amazing when I have my airpods on I can hear I guitar on one ear and Other instrument in my Other ear I recommend you buying this.,1
It's so aggravating I'd rather use YouTube because at least when I use YouTube and play what I'm trying to play it plays it on like spotify it picks and chooses what you listen to even though you've clicked on that certain song Do better spotify,0
What happen to spotify? Why do I feel like I don't know how to play song. The update is not good. Bring it back to normal.,0
Great collection of music!,1
The best application to listen to music,1
"Spotify keeps cutting off while playing song using Bluetooth device!!! This includes ear buds and Bluetooth speakers, its very very frustrating!!!!",0
I am enjoying it so much so that I take my phone to shower and just listen to my Playlists,1
"I've been using Spotify for a few years now, we've a family membership. It's great, I rarely find that they don't have a song/tune I'm after. I have my favourites, and every now and then I go through their suggested listening and sometimes find a new favourite. When I visit my Dad it's on with Spotify and we're filling the house with some oldies, such as Bert Kaempfert and James Last ðŸ˜€",1
"I absolutely love Spotify. If it were a female, I'd put a ring on it. Way to many reasons that won't fit here. I've had literally ALL the other music apps, Amazon, IHeart, Pandora, YouTube, you name it; I am speaking from experience: Spotify Premium is the BEST music app in the world! ðŸ’¯ðŸ¤˜",1
Best music app,1
"Until recently, I could play any song of my liking, no problem. But since the past couple of months spotify is not allowing me to play songs like I want, I can't skip more than 6 times in an hour and I can't manually fast forward the song either. I've tried to make a new account, I've uninstalled and reinstalled but nothing has worked. I don't want to delete this app but unless this gets fixed, I will delete it.",0
This is best app ever with no ads and we can listen unlimited songs in every language this app is realy bestâ£ï¸â¤ï¸,1
Super and real time,1
"Love it, downloading stuff to be able to play offline has saved me so much money.",1
"Your contact us section doesn't work, so that means your review changes. Why am I paying for ad free and still being forced to listen to ads. Doesn't make much sense to me.",0
Just the cursor on mobile if they can change that so you cam scroll faster be much appreciated,0
I love the update but.... my pc account dont have premium stuff but i have it purchased just fix it please. But that it have good song up to 10 million songs.,1
Spotify Premium customer for about 8 years. I don't like not owning my music but this is absolutely the best alternative. Wonderful eclectic catalogue. Super reliable streaming. So long as they continue to be a free speech platform I'll love them. Six stars if I could.,1
"One of the most favourite music application. I am Anmol Patwa (Artist) on Spotify, I recommend Spotify to everyone enjoy music.",1
I like it it's free to listen any where without internet,1
Hey?? Spotify??? I don't pay you $30 every 3 months for the app to crash every time I try another app while it's playing the background....,0
Ads forced on you even after paying. Need the option to filter what is on your homepage. Paying for premium I should not have to see podcasts period or genres that I have no interest in. Paying and then seeing these forced upon you is the same as seeing advertisements. Why are they here.,0
The only reason for a 4 is because I can't share my liked songs. Everything else is just perfect for me. The recommendations engine and discoverability is the best. But not being able to share my liked songs as a playlist is a bummer.,0
very easy and pleasant to use. The ads are annoying.,0
"I have used this app for music and podcasts for a long time and within the past couple of months there have been annoying glitches. The biggest issue is that the controls (play/pause) disappear from the app and the status bar. It even happens in Android auto while driving and i can't stop the music. So I have to reset my phone, uninstall the app or something similar. Extremely annoying!",0
"Very buggy, freezes, won't show play/pause menu etc, won't save podcast progress sometimes or even restarts progress randomly. Hope they can get this fixed ASAP considering I pay for premium.",0
Nice,1
"Why is there no way to view what songs you have in your queue anymore? The button that would bring up your queue is grayed out. I've added songs to the queue and it plays them, so I know my queue isn't empty.",0
When i open spotify its just stuck on the logo screen(means the screen right after opening spotify). Please fix it,0
Everything is good except taking to long to get to song,1
All is very good. Had a few problems but it got solved as new updates are coming.,1
"The best music experience... Old and new... When something is not listed, based on what you may listen to Spotify will eventually find it.. I understand that you have to put in ads when listening for free, however less is better.. Thanks for the comfort in hearing...",1
"Easy UI, infinite range of podcasts and etc. I love Spotify",1
"Spotify used to be fantastic a few years ago, but idk whats happened recently, its always crashing and my music stops randomly, or it freezes up on me. Its still great to listen to music but im hoping it stops crashing",0
Lately there's been Glitches in the showing of Album Artwork,0
My experience with Spotify is great. I love this platform. Thanks Spotify team.,1
"Fix your App, Spotify on Android TV Sucks. Freezes up device completely, forcing a reboot is only solution.",0
"I wasn't having any kind of problems, but then, i opened the app and i can't hear the entire song and only hear 10 seconds and i can't even open a playlist.",0
"Love this music app , I own an iPhone and prefer this over Apple music only con is (not many lyrics to the songs...well when day come thru with all these lyrics it gotta get corrected thanks for all the lyrics Spotify is my Spot",0
It helped me handle stress better. It relieves my soul when i listen to inspirational talks and songs,1
Love this app it makes me feel better when se thing happened.,1
It's overall a good app sure it's pretty annoying without Spotify premium on a phone but apart from that good,1
"SPOTIFY Music is very nice & l am getting varied & all types of music instanty, Thanq",1
I am really enjoying Spotify. I am still learning how to work everything.,1
I really enjoy a personalized oriented playlist i can put ALL the songs i enjoy into. Need more artists on this. I run programs everyday! LOVING IT! 5 stars for more 90/2000s music ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¦¸,1
Best music streaming service no cap,0
"I cant control what song to play. The bar below where you can play or pause or go to the next or previews song is not there anymore that also meansno lyrics. Music stops sometimes when I lock my phone, people share links with me and they dont open up. I dont know what for Im paying premium",0
I used this app it's so smooth in one click the song/podcast start. I really love it ðŸ˜. Thank You ðŸ˜Œ,1
Can't find video option to see podcasts anywhere. This sucks,0
Very easy to use and has everything I want to listen to!,1
Keeps crashing or playing music without a player.,0
Spotify is great!,1
"Bugs and features missing. There's been bugs on it. Recently, the playback buttons aren't showing up, even when you uninstall and update multiple times. I pay for Premium and it glitches from time to time.",0
very greedy. can't we just skip ads? and why do we have to play a music in shuffle if you don't have premium,0
What's going on? I have to force stop this app before every use. If not it won't show my current playing songs. Really annoying. Please fix!,0
Logedin on my family premium plane to listen to music on plan flight and loged out wen u landed and I now just can't get in I have uninstalled it 3 times and it won't work,0
Thank yall for updating and making Spotify better but the thing i hate is 6 skips just why 6,0
"Best music App ever. I love that, besides showing the lyrics of the song, if gives you extra info about the artist, album, song, etc.",1
"after latest update,it will stop playing after a few songs... and sidebar always shows Nothing is Playing.",0
New update crashes not user friendly,0
"One of the best music streams apps i came to use and love everyday that goes by! Keep up the good job guys, personally to me its a full package!",1
"Stops working, doesn't want to play and freezes. I have reinstalled the app 4 times In the last day and update regularly. It's becoming a pain. I've been using it for awhile but recently there are more and more issues.",0
Everything was going good until the new update. Its kinda unfair how I cant preview (listen) the songs before I add them anymore. I just wish it was like before.,0
"You promote guns to invade other countries, and you don't pay enough to the artists, Spotify sucks.",0
Really awesome and amazing App but can you please reduce the comings of Advertisement in often manner either than That everything is just perfect,1
This is truly a good app. However spotify it is glitching and once it finishes a song it won't automatically play the next one also I can't see what my friends are playing anymore. However definitely recommend this app,1
Super,1
"too much ads, hate it",0
I love this app so much. It has a big and positive impact on my life. And it has all types of podcast.,1
Sound quality is best butAfter playing 1 song their started play 4 ad at a time this start to irritate the music lover's,0
It is using too much battery life on my pixel 6 for some reason even if I am doing background listening of already downloaded songs. Otherwise I really like Spotify app over youtube music even though it doesn't have some of the punjabi songs available.,0
Beautiful and so gifted Thank you for your music,1
Love using this app it is great and now i can find the music i love to listen to,1
"Any music I want, anytime. I love it!",1
Best app help me while I'm preparing for neet exam,1
The best! I'm an Artist on Spotify too.,1
I like spotify:) it's got a HUGE selection of different songs wich I love! And u can make playlists of ur favourites.,1
its ez to use even tho there some song that arent there its still nice especially the podcasts,1
"lots of ads, says ""after this add you will get 30 mins of uninterrupted listening just to get another add after just one 2 mins song. its literally a advertisement app with some few selected songs of yours in between",0
Excellent choice of music,1
"Spotify used to be great, but this last update made it so I have to pay to skip songs, I can't pick 1 song because it's jumbled up with others, and the ads are constant. It was fine before, they made it worse.",0
"Loving it & still learning more through it , in mine best opinion it way better than boomplay sound quality great and lyrics at the same cool. We get the chance to meet our old and current artists and upcoming just the right spot Awesome, thanks guys keep up the hot spoti for fans so we can feel soptified at home n everywhere!",1
"Very nice we like spotify , YouTube music or other apps are down in front of you I love spotify. Now also I am hearing kaka songs on spotify",1
It's a pretty good app I just wish that I didn't have to pay after my free month,1
"Missing features that are small, specifically customization in settings. But it's manageable, and still good",1
I like this app a lot because this app contains a lot things like playlist podcasts and more,1
Great app with all the music I love!!,1
Greatest music app!,1
"I LOVED Spotify, It's the only subscription I feel like I simply cannot go without. However, as of recently the control center where you play, pause, skip ahead, etc has disappeared 90% of the time. So now, it I play something, I can't pause unless I close the entire app. Please fix!",0
"Why does shuffle play the songs in the same order every time? I might as well go down the Playlist, and every time I start to listen, I will start it from the beginning. Shuffle the songs more.",0
"I like this app cuz it stores your favorite sobg and episodes but the main problem is the ads,The ads are irritating when you start a new song it justs pop up and ad and talks about premium things but i still like this soooooo its still a 4 star thats all And by the way.......DONT BE SUS :)",0
"I find this app super. I use it to listen to podcasts more than music,but also for music sometimes.",0
helpful. can find any music I need Enjoys listening to a wide genre of music!,1
"it's a nice app where you can listen to music, I do wish when connecting to bluetooth there wasn't as many ads though. Overall its decent",1
Brilliant music app. None like it!,1
Really buggy app - doesn't show currently playing song - randomly stops playing songs,0
Amazing music app,1
Very good selection and quality,1
This app constantly crashes or just stops playing. Sometimes it's still playing but the playback controls disappear. Android auto claims I don't have spitify premium but I do,0
"I really love songs,but I want to listen them I don't like them to see. So, I choose SPOTIFY to listen my favorite music with ad-free",0
Great app. in most cases I just listen to known songs and rarely go look for something else but nonetheless it is a good app. even without premium the app is nice to use but you are capped on 6 skips per hour (Mobile only). You can also remotely control your desktop Spotify versions via your phone without additional settings. Few years later and still happy,1
The only reason I have this app is the Rogan podcast. There are many other options. Once they dump Rogan I am done and gone from this platform/publisher.,0
spotify is a really good app to hear music if you like to :) but they might not have all the songs you like.,1
The fact that I have to pay for a premium membership in order to skip songs or listen to any song I want in a playlist in which ever order I want is just stupid and scummy. I didn't have to before so why should I start now.,0
Has been and always will be my favorite music app,1
"So, I switched from IPhone to Google Pixel a while back, never did get on with Apple. So Spotify it was. I wear hearing aids and recently upgraded to ones that I can stream to and are also the best buds I ever owned ! I was stuck in the 80s, as I guess that's when I last heard music properly, and dismissed new acts. With these new ""buds"" and Spotify both learning what I like and finding what I like, it has been life changing. From 1 song I now have a 26 HR playlist, New Tunes 21, I'm 59, get me",1
Whenever Im hearing a playlist its always shuffled but the problem is there is no shuffle button. And I couldn't see the songs that were included in the playlist. PLEASE FIX THIS. Its stressing me out.. Edit: I'm sorry I keep whining but please fix this.. Please please please please please please please,0
Great streaming platform I use Spotify for all my audio entertainment,1
I'll drop down on Spotify but the Play store wouldn't let me so so the Play store apps they need to fix this now ðŸ¤¬,0
The support team didnt help me and kept blaming my me and my bank.. I missed 1 payment... I tried to pay my subscription in every way possible but it wouldn't work and the bank told me Spotify is the one declining my card.. i had money ðŸ’° and a working card but they just wouldn't accept my payments.. this happened 3 timed..so I had to switch to Tidal!...,0
My Spotify is crashing again and again after the update,0
It is amazing but too much ads if you don't upgrade to premium,0
It's fun to listen to music and relax,1
Just wow,1
Best app for music. I recommend it to everyone who likes music. Has overall best options of genres and artists available.,1
My premium account was HACKED. No way to retrieve ..bank has Blocked spotify.,0
Spotify India still doesn't have many songs. Popular songs. Ed Sheeran not to be seen. his latest songs are not there,0
Best service out there. Works great with my Android Auto.,1
Your favourite music always with you â¤ï¸,1
"App is good and I use only this app for music but since last few days there are too many annoying ads for free version , yes I can get your point that you want more people to buy your subscriptions but this is not the way you should force people btw I am going to upgrade for Quality of music. I feel premium subscribers will get richer experience",0
Playbar is disappearing when playing music. Have to force stop app to get it back. Happening VERY frequently in this build. Needs a fix...,0
"If I was stranded on a desert island with wifi, a phone, and only 1 app, this would be it.",0
Great music! Links to your likes and chooses the best suggestion songs,1
"It used to be a wonderful app and I was about to finish my 1 year usage of this app. Spotify was my favorite, just until they made streaming on other devices PREMIUM. I mean, how can you change a feature's identify of being free or premium after a long time, even after it was free for years! Seriously disappointed with the Spotify company's promise and agreements. Never gonna buy or use this app's features again. I quit Spotify Ltd.!!!",0
"Updated and now I can't get video, thanks spotify",0
"I never liked the free version, but the paid version gives me access to nearly every song I could ever want to hear at any moment and it's worth every penny. Love it.",1
what is this behavior spotify...??? every time when I'm listening to the ads suddenly a song starts playing between them... very much disappointed... ðŸ˜ ,0
Love potion is no longer on here along with some of my other favorite music like rise against.,0
I don't use it a ton but it is good for my podcasts.,1
Bcz of that it's not easy to listen to the music while offline but the experience is good cz I can listen to any songs I desire,1
The app is great but the artists aren't paid enough,0
Sorry this is the best you're getting there is no 0 star. The last update was horrible having limited skips and shuffling the music and adding suggested music is just annoying please change it because I'm going to YouTube music and tidal,0
"Recent update has bugs - playing music with no control bar visible. Can't control pc on phone without the app glitching (literally). If this can be fixed, i will give 5 stars because it's an awesome app all in all",1
"Why there is two copies of same song, ut confuses a lot...When im shuffle playing songs that i like it plays same songs everytime, dont know how their shuffle works cause i am hearing 10-12 songs everyday again and again which teases me a lot.....do something fix it improve it...",1
"The app was great when I first got it. I could choose the song I wanted, loop the song I wanted, AND listen to a song in my playlist in any order. I don't know if this is the update, but please get rid of it. I now can only listen to my playlist in shuffle and it doesn't show my songs.",0
"Most unintuitiv program I've ever come across. After using it for a while I know where to find stuff, but it's still irritating. I'm not a designer but I could easily come up with a better interface. Is this so it's easier to show adds for people who have the free version?",0
It's a tiny bit slow at times but otherwise great. I love the download feature for when I'm driving and offlineðŸ˜,1
"I Enjoy the music selection, artist, album and songs offered. I deside my music, the artist and tune I'm liking... Everything from Head Banging, Country, Rap to Rock-'n'-roll (Then and Now), Elavator, Gospel music ðŸŽ¶ and if the tune Sucks, I've no one to blame but myself... I appreciate You, Spotify, for allowing me to be the DJ of my days. Many Thanks to you guys for all you do and allowing me to choose the Days Tunes... Thanks again, ðŸŽ¶Paul ""MadMax"" MaxsonðŸŽµðŸŽ¶",1
30 min. No adds or interruptions is a LIE ! And why playing songs not on my playlist . If you were honest I would get premium.,0
this app is genuinely bad on purpose and throws 3 minute ads at you every 10 minutes ðŸ’€ it can't even properly play songs i add to a playlist it's permanently on shuffle and plays stuff i did not add to it,0
So many ads while listening song. They are trying to push hard to buy the premium. If you can please cut off the some number of ads play in an hour. Overall the app is great.,1
Excellent service and downlaod feature helps me listen songs when on travels,1
Please make us play any song without using Premium,1
The bugs just keep getting more and more,0
"Liked this app very much after it's launch in India, but some of the songs are unavailable in my country and this made me very dissappointed.",0
The canavas feature is not available for many countries so please add it,1
"Spotify has the best selection of music with an easy to use plattform ,there always updating there criteria so your more likely to find music youve been unable to track down on other plattforns its definantly my go music app for all my listioning needs",1
Super cool life-changing moment when I realised that Spotify premium was missing from my world!,0
This app is very useful and good! But the thing is that I can't listen to my favorites that I've saved without wifi!,1
Great music and lots too choose from in all types. Keep ya days moving .,1
Neil Young deleted and some misinformation podcast instead! Is this a music app or what? Sort your stuff out Spotify or lose my premium subscription.,0
Too many option hidden for non premium. I cannot choose one song from an album and have to listen songs which i do not like. Suck!,0
Great app with a diverse collection of music and audio.,1
Best app spotify,1
"Every time I would listen to my favourite songs while Im doing my homework, but the songs I want to listen plays a different song and pls fix it",1
Good diversity of likable music,1
Love all the different music and mix,1
Had no probs for so many years in my Android phone but now idk why but my Spotify doesn't lauch its always hanged on a black screen.,0
"It is still, a best experience... I've been using Spotify from the start. I'm loving it ðŸ’¯â¤ï¸",1
Had it with Pandora it was glitchy played lists on top of each other and the sound quality through the car was terrible Opened this app up sounded amazing and a whole lot easier to use Going to subscribe right after this,1
Easy listening experience.,1
Spotify is outstanding.,1
It's goood but there are just too many ads ( without permium),0
Its perfect,1
it is just good not better then good because I just got premium and it didn't really work with no internet. then I searched up if you need internet for premium and it said no you don't. so idk what to do.,0
The music isn't playing! I've uninstalled and reinstalled; I've even restarted my phone. I have no idea what is happening. Edited 4.12.22 It keeps stopping the music while playing and not showing anything on the lower part of the screen while in the app. Sometimes the buttons don't even work!,0
I love the opportunity to listen to anything I want whenever I want something specific.,1
"ANOTHER awesome update! The crashing frequency gets worse and worse, now occuring after literally EVERY ""30 minutes of free listening"" ad. Trying to replace two songs in my library has taken over two hours and it's STILL not done. Also, the ""local files"" feature looked good on paper, but that's not working either. Plays 2 or 3 secs of a song then says it's ""not on the device"". I swear to God if this 15th uninstall/reinstall doesn't work, Spotify is history from my life for the last time.",0
Many ads in app this should be fixed but is good so I give it 3 stars,1
"Like Spotify under Family plan, also love the UI interface but the audio quality is bad specially for rock/heavy metal music, after 4 years using Spotify, I finally switched to YouTube Music and the quality audio is amazing, specially on the car.",1
I love this it help me relieve stress,1
"Quality poor! The sound quality of the music is poor! I have a bose headsets and the music quality is poor using spotify. YouTube music is a lot better quality! I have high speed broadband, so its not that and i have over 200GB of free space on my phone!.",0
Not great. Constantly freezes and has glitches. Bugs with every update.,0
A fantastic app without many logging in and it access just perfect,1
"Kind of weird how your app seems to crash every time I select a podcast that has a covid-19 banner, even one I've already previously started listening to",0
Super good music and really easy to figure out if u just started to use it is recommend,1
"I love to listen music in this app and I have been listening music in this app for a long time , but recently I m having some issues,like music often stops in the middle and needs to touch the screen or needs to open app again to play music.(downloaded music)",0
Great app. Good for Christian music,1
"Some genius thought the interface needed a revamp, and changes the layout of all the play button. So frustrating!!!",0
Music helps keep me grounded and Spotify gives me music. Perfect match,1
Why don't your l have the premium mini And why did you're make this app can't listen to a music with out paying,0
"got locked out and cant get back in. also, you should let me see if a song is the right thing instead of shuffling it with random songs before adding to a playlist.",0
Awesome service! Share a plan with my 14 year old son and we love it.,1
I wanna rate it 5 stars but i didn't because the ads on spotify is so anoying like you cant even skip and sometimes so much ads on one song so yeah theres premium but i dont have enough money to buy premium,0
Worst Music Listening Program It's too bad.,0
"Been using it for years, it's always been buggy and has gotten much worse lately. Quits playing in the middle of songs. Quits playing in the middle of podcasts. Doesn't realize it's currently playing a song or podcast. The podcast library and list are so inferior, no reasonable sorting algorithms or ability to manually put your podcasts in order. Yes, I'm even a paid subscriber with a family plan ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸",0
"When you search the music and try to play it, it always shuffle plays which sucks...you guys need to fix this",0
I'm pleased how easybitbis for me to find music and listen plus the library bod music in here is amazing ðŸ˜,1
"This is probably the best music app you can get and I strongly recommend it. The app has very good customer service and the subscriptions are cheap and well made. The music selection is really good too. If I had to rate this app I'd say one out of ten is... Ease of usage 7-8 Customer service 8-8.5 Music/podcast selection 7.5-8.5 Sound quality 8.5-9.5 So over all 8.3 out of 10 but that's still really really good ""compared to the 6-7 Pandora got """,1
"It has no drawbacks or anythingas such. But just way to many advertisements, all about Spotify. Only that has to decrease a bit",0
"In general I like the app, but if it let's you create your own play lists then it should allow you play it in the order you arranged not shuffled. Lower rating after I noticed that the majority of time I'm getting ads after every song.",0
I canceled my subscription 2 months ago soon as my free trial was up and I still get charged.,0
Love Spotify. HATE THE APP. It's the worst. Shuts off randomly. The widget barely works. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. It's not the phone either. It's like this on my last 3 phones. Been terrible for years.,0
Continue to have problems with app not stopping play. App will say nothing is playing but there it is definitely playing. I have to go into settings and force stop the app. Also will do the opposite. I will open the app and can't get anything to play and will have to force stop the app. Then it seams to work for awhile.,0
Do glad I subscribed for this my mental state got way better ... Hello Spotify won't it be cool is I can just play random musics like shuffle musics without choosing a category,0
I just can't understand how it works He doesn't give the song when I ask for it He puts a lot of songs in front of me and I can't get over it ðŸ’€,0
It has been glitching for the past few days and I can't pause it or skip bc the bar where it shows music doesn't show up!!,0
Good music but way too many ands there not too often but when I get them I get like 3 at a time,1
Since few weeks crashing all the times. Looking for other app.,0
Still exploring but enjoying Spotify for the first time!,1
"Amazing experience! All the songs and albums, whether local or international, for last 30 years I've been enjoying...are now at my fingertips at the highest quality...thanks to Spotify.",1
Really good app but i wish it didn't keep playing recommended songs instead of playing my liked songs and I can't switch to my liked songs after either,0
If it would play thru an entire JRE without having to close and reopen multiple times as ads come(finish ads and the show won't start no matter how many times you hit play and pause) causing you to force the app closed a couple times and restarting the app just to listen. Now I can't even click on JRE or an episode or it just sends me to the homescreen? Thanks for taking Joe and then failing to provide as good a service as GOOGLE PODCASTS come on now..,0
Fantastic app with great content. Love the wide range of podcasts.,1
Great,1
Im much happier with my previous music app,1
"Constantly being harassed to allow Bluetooth and they will only let me say ""maybe later"". Every time I open the app I get harrassed. I wouldn't be surprised if Spotify was run by sexual predators living out thier fantasy of people not being able to tell them ""no"". If this harassment continues, I will be canceling my subscription and sailing the seven seas to get my music.",0
There are a lot of ads. There are 3 ads after every 1-2 songs.,0
Very nice and international music app,1
"Hi everyone... It has been a great experience with Spotify. But last 2 days I am not able to play the music, the application closes automatically after playing. Kindly help me to fix this problem.",0
"I would love to take your premium... I desperately want your premium, but all i have is either Rupay card Or UPI and you take none of it... You don't know how irritating it os for me to miss so many offers when i really really want your premium...",0
Nice with all diversity of beautiful music.,1
"Very good app to listen to music on, I use it almost daily. Just one thing is that they recently removed the shuffle play button. I hear why they did and it makes sense, but I think it should be added back for personal playlists. Overall great app",1
"It's a great app but whenever I want to play a certain song and I click on it, it gives me a Playlist with the dong in it and others songs. Like yes I want other songs like the one I'm looking for AFTER I hear the song I originally wanted. Like if I'm looking for the song ""the Edge"" by Panicland it'll show the song cover and instead of that being the first song played it gives me othes like it then after like 5 songs it finally plays like tf?",1
"I love this app,it's my best music source!",1
Really glitchy on my new Samsung s22 ultra. I had no problems before.,1
Good but it deletes downloaded songs for no reason and it'll be nice if you could check your music stats at anytime not only at the end of the year,0
"Since the last update, it's been quite glitchy. The screen won't show what current song/podcast is playing, it will show the last one I was listening to. At times it would also stop playing when my screen would go black. Other than that I love Spotify.",0
"Non-stop exuberance, only next to God's Presence. Great worship!!",1
"Easy to navigate, lyrics are available...",1
"No controls visible anymore. (Play, pause, etc) My app will stop playing for no reason. This just started over the last few days. Without the play / pause option, I cannot pause my podcast or music when someone comes to speak with me. Additionally, the app keeps playing despite receiving phone calls.",0
Great content and variety. Does it make it the radio of the 21st century? Minus 1 star for lower sound quality on mobile but otherwise it's really 5!,0
"All round great app. Well worth paying the subscription for. Discover weekly is my favorite feature, I've discovered so many artists I now love. Also appreciate the ability to download songs for offline use, no other app has stood the test of time like Spotify has for me.",1
"It's a good app , best part is i can listen my favourite k-pop music all kinds song genre are available ,so listen whatever you want to listen .",1
It is such a great app. It has all the songs a men can imagine. It also recommends good songs,1
I have been using this app for so long.... And it's great,1
Best music app i have downloaded ever..I am surprised why I didn't get it before ðŸ¤¦,1
Really enjoy Spotify so easy to use too.,1
"I am in love with this app , this is the best app for music lovers.",1
"Spotify had absolutely tanked. Why am I, a paying customer who PAYS for NO ads, GETTING ADS?? What is the point? The app continually glitches, has always given me trouble when I want to download podcasts and just crashes (even after clearing cache, force quitting, and restarting my device). It's absolutley terrible and I really hope they fix this soon or I'm switching back to YouTube once I'm fed up with it.",0
"This app is useless, unless not being able to hear the song you look for gets fixedðŸ˜’",0
"To be an app you have to pay for, it sure crashes a lot",0
The app works well has a lot of good music.,1
My favorite way to listen to music and podcast,1
"I enjoy this greatly however a update recently or something caused my filter in liked songs to look scrambled and not scroll over aka rock, etc etc looks garbled mess overlapping hopefully it'll be fixed can't even side slide it llke before.",0
I think it's great. I find ALL the music I listen to,1
So far I love Spotify. Had great results so far.,1
"Been a prime member for almost 2 years straight. Found myself in financial problem. Couldn't afford anymore. Hate hate hate!! The fact free users have a completely different app for mobile. It's insane! Can't sreach an album or artist without it obscuring the list. There in no click more. Made a playlist added 2 songs. Because it is so vastly different, it added your suggested song? Why even do this? Think I'm gunna go back to downloading my music again. Windows Media Player has been reliable",1
If I could have only 1 app it would be Spotify. Love it and use it for hours every day,0
"WAS a 5 Star! My husband and I are Spotify die-hards! Gladly pay the premium monthly, but if the constant app crashes doesn't stop- we will be looking for another streaming service. I'm glad I came to the Reviews, because I was convinced that there was no way it could be this app and they hadn't fixed it by now.. Plenty of reviews before mine for Spotify to get a clue.",0
I love Spotify. Buts so buggy on my S21 ultra. Can't get the now playing bar at the bottom to display. My music will just start playing out of no where. Sometimes it just won't play. Every day the bugs get more and more frequent.,0
It won't play my podcasts if I hit play it plays songs that I don't even have or listen to.,0
"Used to love Spotify but now not so much. For starters,while the mini player is active, it often disappears from notification panel and I lose control over what's currently playing. Even switching songs does not bring it back, I have to force close the app, then reopen and track down whatever I was last listening to and find the specific episode all over again. Not to mention, how are you going to take it upon yourself to add songs to my Playlist...",0
Pathetic the music just cuts out at times very annoying going back to Apple music ðŸ˜¡,0
"I would like to be able to sort my 'favorite' songs into categories, but it's still a good choice all around.",1
It keeps crashing all of a sudden. No play bar now either. What the frik? Spotify is my Dopamine. Please Fix. Thank you.,0
Fantastic best app for listening music,1
"30 minutes of add free music? Great, I'll watch the add. 20 minutes later, ""Want 30 minutes of add free music?"" Yes, yes I do. Can't find that here though. They cheat you of your time.",0
Can no longer pause or change songs. See lyrics on my phone.,0
"I only signed up to claim my artist account and have ended up loving the app! Can't fault something that brings so much joy, aaaannndd, I've found so many new artists through suggested songs and such. Brilliant!!!",1
"I am begging you, improve the offline functionality. Song that are supposed to be downloaded won't play, the menues are buggy as hell offline and half the time will just not load, sometimes I can't even pull up my library.",0
I really enjoy using this app but some time it automatically stop but I like this app ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚,1
Music list is excellent,1
A lot of app issues From time to Won't react to play/pause/stop. the bar disappears and from time to time can not be controled from my Jabra earbuds. To stop sometimes you have to exit the app. The UI is not intuitive. takes time to understand. Difficult to find the recent played songs.,0
App is great but need to work on the group session because I can not join my friends group session and they can't join mine.,0
Too many add but good to use,1
The app will randomly crash or not show what song I'm playing. It's been happening way too consistently and for too long and needs to be fixed.,0
Nice app for hear,1
Friendly and easy to use... Great APP.... All the music you want. I totally Recommend it.,1
"Best developer team among app teams!!! Enhance has good predictability, success with the dynamic multiregression/multivariat algorithm. Smaller sample sizes for breaking habits gently and creating variation.",1
"Pretty good so far, better than YouTube music.",1
"I can't open the app no matter how much l try it keepa in saying ""spotify is not responding"" even when l just installed it also an ad played and after the af finished it said ""enjoy 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" but a long ad played against after 3 minutes",0
I firmly believe this app is the best music app because you can basically have any song from UK drill to 70s and the adds aren't even that long nor are there alot of adds so that is why u should choose Spotify over anything else,1
Awesome,1
At first it was good when i had a option to not suffle but now i cant even not suffle,0
"Good app for music but.........,...... It want subscription for download musicðŸŽ¶ ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜…",0
Great app. Almost any song you can think about and one flat fee. No ads thank god!,1
Verrrrrrrrrrry good app I found my favorite songs Incredible!,1
My podcast stops playing after 5 minutes and when I hit play it continues to stop I'm switching to stitcher,0
Shuffle is not. I would like my playlists to be mixed,0
It's about time they swipe to add to queue was added to android! Hallelujah!,0
"Always liked the app but recently it's started to not display what I'm listening to so i can't pause it, rewind, skip, anything basically. Only way i can find to stop the app is play the last song on an album and turn the sound down and it finishes after the last song. Don't want to uninstall and reinstall as a friend did that and lost a load of songs somehow.",0
A wonderful choice of music!,1
Easily the best music app in existence,1
I am giving 4 stars because there is too much of disturbance in between the songs like in every song I am listening a add. I know that it is important for u to show the add but plz show with a limit so that anyone can listen the songs peacefully. Plz fix it your next update. Thank you,0
I have premium,1
"Was great until this new update, I can't even pick what song I want to play, have to go through playlists to reach the one song I'm trying to listen to. Spotify needs to get its act together again. May aswell just use youtube.",0
"I have my settings set to not play any additional songs after a Playlist has completed, yet every time I've played any Playlist in the past two weeks there are additional songs that get played. I have my kids around and I don't want them hearing some random song that popped on. Update: still happening.",0
"It used to be perfect. But now I can't even play anything. Everytime I try to play a song, the app crashes",0
"Love this app. Very happy with it. But if you drop or censor Joe Rogan, I will drop the app and go elsewhere.",0
"Is this what I get for a paid premium service? A buggy as hell app? Latest is the player just disappears so there's no control, or playing randomly starts in background. How can a company the size of Spotify just not just get it to work right???",0
Very easy to use & navigate,1
Best way to listen to music and poscasts!,1
"I use spotify everyday, its my favourite music streaming platform. ðŸ’¯",1
Amazing variety and great quality audio track,1
"Great uplifting Christian music by Bryann Trejo, and more..",1
Good easy and simple for uploading your own music ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽµ,1
Spotify did play good earlier but now it keeps cutting for 5 seconds multiple times per song really annoying,0
Great place to leasen to podcast,1
Love it music is the best feeling when your down,1
Can't even login using Google despite having premium membership. No matter how i try to login via Google it just won't work.,0
The search bar keeps telling me it can't find songs - it doesn't matter what I type into it.,0
I like 50s and 60s ðŸŽ¶ holds lots of memories for me and hubby John that I care for 24/7 we have sing song just the two of usðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ’ž,1
Honestly with the choice of quality variety and access to podcasts and audible tracks as the home for my music I dont think you can do better right now Now if they added whole music videos theyd be my favorite even over MTV back in the day,1
"I have this ""glitch"" where my currently playing doesn't show at the bottom, and if I leave it be it will often freeze/stutter and eventually stop. If close the app and open it that seems to fix it at least until the next time I stop leave and come back to the app",0
I like this app cause you can type in any song you want but I used to have JOOX but I couldn't find my fav playlist or song but I'm only giving it 3 stars cause it just starts playing the song I listened to the day before when I'm doing my work and it's very annoying pls fix it,0
"This is my best music app i use everyday, but the ad is so f**kin anoying.",0
i really inlove with this app but i don't like the ads and its free!,0
A great app for listening to music and podcasts!!,1
"Please, fix the bugs from the last update.",0
Best music streaming,1
"It's so damn buggy now. The play bar at the bottom of the screen no longer appears when I'm playing music so I CANNOT PLAY/PAUSE, USE SCRUBBING OR FAST FORWARD, REWIND, SKIP. Ya know all the most basic and essential functions of a music playing app.",0
"I just paused a song and went to do some errands on another app. When I come back, all of my queue and now playing song is gone and it just reset to the home screen. So annoying!",0
"Worst App for music. Firstly you can't choose where the Playlist starts (I would like the beginning) and then once you get the music to play suddenly a random song comes up (hidden gem, they call it) that has ABSOLUTELY no link to the music you want to hear. Playing Disney songs for the kids and suddenly some random music?? Who would pay for such an abysmal app?!",0
More than song ad are shown. After every song that is ad that to 3-4 ads. And it always shows no internet even when there is full internet.,0
Love the content! JRE myeft favorite. Please don't cave to the 'left'.,1
Idk it's just hit different on Spotify,1
It's the best music platform,1
I love Spotify so much this is so easy to use and you can make it on playlist I listen to my playlist all day and everyday,1
"Great product. The algorithms are pretty spot on, I suspect because there are smart people monitoring and revising them constantly based on continuous feedback data from users.",1
Great selection of classic period music from the sixties ...,1
This is how it goes when you go to play Spotify alright I want to listen to this playlist after 15 minutes of ads I rather go to SoundCloud or YouTube,0
It's my favorite music app tho sometimes the music just randomly pauses idk if it's just my phone other then that it's really good â™¡Â´ï½¥á´—ï½¥`â™¡,1
Like it is really good app . I found every song in it ....but there should be feature of download of that song for offline .,1
google assistant commands not working on spotify from yesterday,0
Too much a adds,0
I use spotify on my chromebook. I have issues where if i have two windows open side by side my music will lag. Today Im having an issue where in the bottom left corner where when your playing music the song your listening to is there but for me its saying nothing is playing yet im listening to a song..,0
I don't like the Spotify anymore because it's shuffling it's own and I don't know how to remove it.,0
Its and amazing app but when your premium ends the playlists you had downloaded will only leave the episodes and podcasts downloaded like its the only thing you downloaded its pretty annoying some people cant pay premium every month like minors Im 14 and my mom wouldnt be letting me waist 160 pesos every month But as I said its an amazing app cause its got many songs and playlists you can share with other people,1
Although the app is good it's really irritating that the songs are played in shuffle. Like making this feature unavailable for free users was absolutely unnecessary. We can play the songs in order on a laptop then why not on a phone? This is such a simple feature and why is this not available for free users? Hope you can update this for free users as well,0
Good app and the only subscription I pay for!!! I use it 9 hours a day so I get my money's worth. It can be buggy at times but they are always updating and improving the service.,1
"Love it, so easy to listen to your favourite songs!",1
Why the hell full screen album art on lock screen was made mandatory? It should be optional. It makes the lock screen more ugly. Please fix this. We users are asking to fix this issue for years and you guys are not even listening to us. Really disappointed with Spotify team ðŸ‘Ž,0
When i open shared link like shared music or album from friends Spotify app just shows nothing I can't see what is shared with me on my android phone,0
Best music app I ever seen sometimes ads disturbs you but it's ok.,1
"(April 26, 2022)App stability has gotten unacceptable. The app just stops playing music randomly, it stops accepting inputs from Blu tooth devices randomly and the only way to fix this is by restarting the device. Honestly the quality of the app has declined sharply.",0
The new update for the phones is not like it is on Ipad,0
I can listen to the music while using another aplication.,1
"Don't use this app, don't give your money to Spotify. Switch to bandcamp and actually support artists and not be force fed platform exclusives daily or be bombarded with ads in your listening. Latest update appears to have completely borked the shuffle function, frequently goes over songs that were playing only minutes before.",0
I love this app bt i have face a problem. I'm a premium user bt my download option is not properly work in my device.,0
Love the app but keep coming into glitches where it doesn't allow background running. The music will stop as soon as my screen goes off.,0
App is glitching really bad doesn't show what you are playing and randomly stops music. Please check it,0
"After 1 hours(Non stop) used this app and I think after 10 time advertisement I received that, Why should I get a premium a/c?. And I realised this app creator does not care about if I'm listen music through their app(when I used in free), I cannot get into a mood of my favourite song list (like songs) cuz advertisement always interrupted me. When 2nd or 3rd time I received advertisement I think I must get premium. But after 10 times, I'll never waste money on this app, I'll uninstall this app.",0
Amazing podcast for me,1
I had no problems with Spotify until a few days ago.. I used to link it to set my alarm but now it's not qorking the same.. Fix that issue and it's one of the best music apps ever....,1
Phenomenal listening. I love the playlists.,1
The latest update is buggy. The song currently playing doesn't appear in the banner. The song intermittently stops playing.,0
There's an issue where the songs that are playing disappears. I have to keep force stopping the app and opening it again for it to show up again. This is a huge nuisance. Please fix this. I've cleared the cache of the app (within the app and on my phone's system.) I'd install and reinstall however I have 20 gigs of downloads. This shouldn't be an issue if the first place.,0
"New update pauses songs while listening on mobile and desktop for no reason (on wifi as well as data mode, doesn't matter at what quality).",0
Lots of good sounds for free!,1
GOOD,1
I don't like being prompted to rate any app,0
This is very good song app ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,1
The play bar isn't showing the song will play but I cant pause or see or use the little bar in or outside the app,0
The app is fine but pay the artists fairly. Literally worth billions and they pay fractions of a cent per stream,1
"If I'm listening to a podcast, after playing one episode it will stop and won't load anything. It's no just paused it's just like the whole thing breaks. They always play 'suggested songs' even if I have a playlist with a ton of songs already there. Also, when I pause it, I come back and its playing again.",0
spotify premium is fantastic. i use it every single day with out fail for huge amounts of time each day. bit pricey at Â£9.99 but with student discount or when offers are on at Â£4.99 its perfectly acceptable,1
Can find all the songs I am looking for and with ease. Very commendable.,1
Relaxing and enjoyable to listen while walking,1
"app hasnt been functioning properly since a while, ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times but none of the cover arts are loading and my playlists are taking too long to download, kindly look into this :/",0
"I hate it when play the music you want, it plays other music",0
My network is fine but it doesn't download and says no internet connection,0
"I have had Spotify for 10 years and love the app, but what drives me nuts is that every once in a while they add a feature that auto-adjusts your volume for you and I HATE it; it's so annoying to set it up and then your music gets quieter when you didn't set it that way. The most recent add is the worst though, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TURN IT OFF. Spotify, fix this. I have always hated this feature and I need to be able to turn it off.",0
The inability to download individual songs from an album.,0
"Premium sucks, it won't let me play the songs that I want without shuffling, and it doesn't even play the songs from that album",0
Where's the playlist? I can't edit the playlist when it's played,0
What's gone wrong. Having the same issues as all the recent negative reviews. Control bar disappearing constantly. Random pauses and dropouts even while playing downloaded music. App crashing also. So frustrating. Never had issues like this before the most recent. Hope Spotify heed the call of their paying customers and rectify this ASAP.,0
Freedom to listen to the music and podcasts I choose without censorship! Excellent music library. Keep it uncensored!!!,1
It is a nice app but I can't add my other favourite artists so I had to give 4 stars but I really love this app.,1
It's great in all but song from other artists puts their song even tho I wanna play my song. Please fix this issue.,1
This app isn't special when it comes to music and podcast. Where it fails is if you live in a poor service area. You can't access your downloaded content until it finishes searching for an internet connection. Every time. It will tell me there is no internet. It will show a blank screen. all I want to do is listen to my downloaded content. It's very useless in most low service scenarios. Plus the app constantly malfunctions. Very unsatisfied,0
Auto play is good .very best app for music listening with less data .if ðŸ‘Œ â˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºâ˜º,1
Easy to use. Plenty of songs and artists to choose from.,1
While listening to podcasts the app pauses sometimes 10 to 20 times an hour. Sometimes it will close out of the podcast I was listening to and I'll have to find where I was. Very irritating. This has been going on for months.,0
"Good app, but I don't know why I can't play a certain music. Whenever I click on a song another song will play, this is so irritating and I beg the programmers to remove this.",0
I don't like this app cuz I play bad liar it open a wrong soundðŸ˜¢,0
"I enjoy accessibility of variety of audio genre, specific albums and artists thereto. On Spotify, one has all music in one space nicely. I'm loving it â¤",1
Very good app for music!ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ðŸ¥°â¤ï¸ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,1
Works quite well for my musical needs and has been my favorite musicial app for years now!,1
App is pure sht. It plays randome tracks instead I had chosen.,0
"I've been using Spotify for a long time and it's worked wonders! But recently, the song stops mid-way for no reason! I check the app and the icon in the bottom to pause and play the song isn't there, then I have to shuffle my playlist again. Another thing is anytime I want to add new songs I can't hear a preview. For me I used to be able to hit loop on songs but now I'm not allowed to anymore (if it was changed to a premium feature I wasn't aware of that, sorry.) Besides that the app is great!",1
Best app for music love ,1
"Often buggy and when you need customer support it's hard to get to it. If you finally do, the help takes way way too long and they still don't manage to get it all right (even though they say they did)",0
"Loved it until recently. I am sick of seeing the new artist ads for music not in my interests, the covid notifications, and the general pushing of content that I wish I could turn off and just listen undistracted.",0
Why i can't play the song? I have paid for premium,0
"Good experience, I downloaded just for the Joe Rogan podcast, all I've ever used before was Pandora, and this app seems to be alot easier and better to manuever thru, and maintain your channels, and you pick up where it left off, I hated on Pandora when something would happen and I'd have to restart something or another, then I miss the song that was just on.. you gotta just wait it out to hear it come on again. There rotation was small so it wasn't long lol",0
"This is better then Amazon music, I love it. I keeps me up with new songs. Pretty sure they dont have all of these on it. But i hate the advertisements",1
Best music/podcast app I've used. I've cancelled a lot of subscriptions based on needs vs wants and the has been with me through the hard workouts and the long study sessions. I'll probably never cancel this subscription.,0
"WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE ""REMOTE"" OPTION FROM THE TIZEN SMART WATCH APP? I'm asking over here because u guys are obviously not reading the feedback of tons of PISSED OFF smart watch users in the Galaxy Store. You basically killed exclusive functionality that kept a lot of us from switching to TIDAL! At least give us a stand-alone Spotify REMOTE app for TIZEN if you feel the need to remove it from the main app. U guys basically fk'ed us with that last TIZEN update, or should I say DOWNGRADE.",0
"Spotify tells that it gives 30 mins of ad free music but it gives ad after every 6-7 mins. And now it contains sexual content too. Idk what are sexual audios doing in a music ap. It's disturbing when such cheap content pops up on the screen while searching for my fav songs. Your ads are very irritating I swear. I know they are made to sound irritating, I swear the voices get to my nerves so much.",0
"The autoplay setting is completely broken--it will always keep playing different music, regardless of what your app setting choice is. Very annoying!",0
To many ads especially it cuts off song to play a ad,0
It's a good app for listening to you favorite music,1
Good. But it can only connect to my boom box for short time.,0
One of the best music streaming service,1
Amazing app best app for listening to music ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ,1
"I don't have any complaints over the app but, I've got a suggestion if you can consider. I was just thinking, if there would be an option to mute all notifications that could disturb the song. Like a slider near shuffle or repeat option so that the user can listen songs without disturbances. But keeping in mind the importance of the notifications in one's life, this option could be turned off manually or automatically when someone clears the RAM or closes the app.",0
Great app brilliant music the best,1
New update crashes the app all the time. Sometimes it'll be playing but won't show the banner at the bottom with the song playing so no way to stop the music except force closing the app. Frustrating.,0
Need to add option to redeem spotify card from app itself .currently I only see a credit card and paypal options .guess you guys dont seems to care .please add that option to the app or me personally I'm done .it shouldn't be hard to add that option to the app.,0
All of you that are complaining about skips and ads need to buy the subscription lmao ðŸ¤£ stop being cheap ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ GREATEST MUSIC APP YETðŸ¤·ðŸ½â€â™‚ï¸,0
I love Country music and I can listen to it any time I want to. Also I love that I don't have any commercials because I really hate them.,1
"Unable to do simple functions. It should be imperitive for any app that the ""search"" function work. Unfortunately this app, with as much money as they put into it, is unable to do so. Sorry spotify.",0
I'm definitely enjoying my everyday listening to my playlist. It's best when you go premium. ðŸ‘Œ,1
"Love this app been premium for like 2-3 years, but now i can't go into home (like first page when u enter) and would be cool if that is fixed",0
I love being able to pick what kind of music and artists to listen to. Also you can skip songs if it's not your favorite. Great streaming service.,0
"Its good app, but atleast am not seeing provision for downloading songsðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”",0
"It is the best music streaming app in the world , its personalised recommending power is incomparable .",1
I've tried all kinds of music apps and I like Spotify way better than the rest it's a good price and you can hear what you want to for the most part the way you want to,1
I honestly love this app But since last night it started crashing once I viewed my 2021 wrapped I hope y'all look into it,1
Has all the songs I like. Easy to operate without a bunch of unnecessary frills. More than willing to pay for this app.,1
"Crashing since November 2021. Please fix. Uninstalled/reinstalled, cleared data and cache...",0
Amazing if you have premium and if you can't afford you still have 3 months free,1
"What happened? It's been working brilliantly for years, but now I can't change the song, the play/stop bar doesn't show it, to stop my music I have to close the app completely, and it's started randomly stopping while songs are playing.. give me the old Spotify back!",0
"Premium User. After hundreds of ""likes"" and hundreds of ""dislikes"", the Spotify algorithm is still recommending 95% of songs I don't like and only 5% songs I like. Lyrics functions is not good, somehow seems programmed without adequate interface. Deezer is way better! Button to dislike Artist not on main screen, kinda hidden. Offline mode not great. If you decide to unlike a song it will not record your action, because you are not online. It could record the action and update when online.",0
"I am giving this app a 2 outta 5 cuz it's way too many ads. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE TIME I PLAY A SONG, IT'S AN AD AFTER AD. ITS STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢",0
"It's amazing, just bummer that you can't get songs that are only found on YouTube on Spotify but otherwise I like this app a lot",1
Absolutely Brilliant ways to enjoy my favourite podcast Joe Rogan. It's good there's a platform where you free to discuss ideas. Plenty of choice and opinion to listen to other things for free,1
Um I've had this app for 2 years now but the last update you had on it was weird and it would kick me out of the app,0
It's an absolute cheating against those people who don't buy Spotify Premium... Because there are 3 long nasty ads after each and every song... I'll delete my account if you don't reduce those long ads after every song...,0
"Great app! Great settings, great mechanics, great everything \(^-^)/ Edit: 6/3 happy birthday to me yesterday, anyway I got a suggestion. Will you guys ever implement 360 Audio?",1
"The best music app... I can relax, unwind and energies with any song I wantðŸ˜ðŸ‘Œ",1
It's a good app but downloading songs shouldn't be a premium luxury As a broke student with no income its an inconvenience not to be able to listen to music offline,0
"Stops playing from library randomly,doesnt even show the window where u pause and stop till u force close and restart...awful app Gonna 1 star it because for a paid service they don't even bother explaining what is new with the updates. They don't even put any description usually and today they said: ""We are always making improvements and changes""....What improvements? What changes? This is a disgrace. They don't even bother with update logs...unprofesional.",0
I just love music and it's so easily accessible through Spotify. everyone knows that.,1
I love to listen to music and I love podcasts so much,1
"Love the app , Instant music and more !!",1
"Suck app . Don't Tell me what to listen . I'll listen whatever i want fk app stupid . I can't even choose the song i want to listen . When , i was emotional it totally suck . I so mad at this stupid appp!!!!!",0
Keeps closing unexpectedly after an ad plays. Sometimes several ads play before the app closes.,0
Well it's all good but there is only one problem that it so so many adds but besides that 1. It's very easy to use 2. The audio quality is very good ðŸ™‚ 3. It has dark mode baby aha...,1
Nice,1
"Geez you guys are so desperate for money, i cant play the songs i want without you having to keep the damn playlist of shuffle, i can never get to the right song with skip cause we only have 6, i get about 5 ads ever 2 songs, and then you start to play other songs that wernt even in the playist to Begin with, and so much more. The app was good at first untill you had to ruin it by trying to force us to get premium by making the app even more shittier ever update money stealing bastards",0
I can't see lyrics of any of the song,0
"Worst music experience it only plays the suggested one and not what i searched, it has so many bugs and so many ads, i logged out and logged in again still it doesn't play my searched song its totally dictatorship",0
I've just pulled my premium membership and will be finding new platforms for my favorite content. This is directly due to your treatment of Joe Rogan and the fact that you are censoring free speech of ANY kind on your platform. The app has become too inconvenient... I've enjoyed this service for a while but my complaint is I can only stream on one device at a time. If I'm going to pay for premium I should be able to have multiple devices listening at once.,0
"Spotify is not only great for the music you love, but for the music you're yet to love ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ",1
The app is goof but since the last update it keeps glitching and whenever i wanna change a song i have to close the app and reopen it,0
like th apps,1
Loving it. It's just what I have been looking for.,1
I like this app sm very recommended but when I want to see lyrics in some songs its always said cant load lyrics I think it was my connection and tried again but still its just the same I just hope you guys can fix that,1
Love the selections do many to choose!!,1
Usually I love Spotify but now NONE of the lyrics load (are you removing this feature??) And it randomly turns off lately,0
Very user friendly and handy related songs helps you find some classics.,1
I am having problems in listening songs as whenever I search for a song it ask me to go online and search even though I am online and every online app is working problem except this one from few weeks,0
"This is good, but can we get a ""friends activity"" in mobile version, please, make it realtime.",1
Spotify knows my musical taste better than I do. Great suggestions!,0
Great music keep it up,1
The ads can be very annoying if you don't have premium. I bought premium but I don't think should have to just to listen to music without getting interrupted ever couple of minutes.,1
"GARBAGE! wouldn't play a single thing for longer than 2 seconds before the whole thing just went away. No ""stopped working"" notification or anything, just POOF. web player audio is all weird, gets loud for a second then quite. Whatta waste of time.",0
Happy as King I love Spotify ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— Spotify is like my medicine â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸. I am buying this companyðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.,1
Only 4 stars because if you don't have premium you can't peak at the next song and that it sometimes just stops your song and you have to open the app to play it again. Other than that its great.,0
Its too much advertisement..ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®,0
"How about instead of the ""We added"" part you just let me have my playlist JUST with what I added?",0
Why is Spotify crashing constantly all of a sudden?!?!?? You still love this app beginning to hate it..... Whyyyyy?????,0
"Ok so u used this app to listen to all my favorite songs for years, But got it on a phone and it was different. Idk if it's the divice type but this made me stop using the app, so first, when I go to find a song and click on it, I canot loop it. Secondly, when I save songs to my playlist I cant listen to the ones i want to, it just makes me listen to all of my songs when I dont want to, Thirdly, when I search up a song it doesn't let me play it, instead it plays other songs from the creator.",0
Awsome app love that I can get a variety of music that matches my mood,1
As some songs are not available at it so m giving it 4 stars and hope u gonna fix it asap.. â‰¥ï¹â‰¤,1
I love spotify but recently it will stop my music alot of times during the song even if there downloaded,0
"All songs and even ads only play for a second before it pauses. I have a strong connection, and video streams fine in HD in other apps just fine. This is garbage.",0
It has all kinds of great music that I like to listen to,1
I have been missing music and didn't know it!,0
One day I was able to switch between songs and fast forward or go back a song but now I cant anymore. It's always telling me to buy premium. And I HATE when songs that are recommending are put on my playlist and I cannot fast forward past them. I shouldn't have to pay for wanting to listen to music.,0
It stops in midle of songs always,0
"Offline music is terrible doesn't seem to play until I have service. What is the point of this..? Too many negatives with this app, don't even get me started. Apple Music is getting better day by day but offline is needed. I'm off the grid more than you would like or know!",0
I love Spotify it's a great app but recently it was has been super buggy and glitchy. Please fix this because it is becoming a huge problem.,0
Excellent music app,1
"The worst app I've ever used, ads all the time and a lot of them, six skips AN HOUR plus not being able to play any song you like you have to listen to a whole Playlist in a random order with a few songs you were actually looking for, I also constantly run into problems that span across four phones and a laptop so it isn't my device, another limitation is listening on only one device at a time and it takes a little to switch, the only thing I use it for is listening to podcasts which isn't bad",0
Good but not enough lyrics,1
You have excellent quality and millions of songs it's very appreciative,1
"App doesn't work well! Doesn't show which music is playing! Supper slow! Hangs all the time! If it doesn't get fixed soon, I'm unsubscribing premium from next month!",0
"Top quality recording. Links to albums. Words of the songs, augment the total experience. Bravo Zulu",1
Please bring back the dragable slider in your liked songs!!!,0
Buggies app for the past 3 years. Can never stay consistent in operations throughout updates,0
"Been amazing for a few years and has recently been stopping play, not showing what's currently playing with no way to control. I give it another week or so before canceling sub and going back to Pandora.",0
"Would've given 5 stars because I've been enjoying and using it for years now. But there are things that I didn't like, like I exit the app and I stop listening, then if I go back to the app after minutes or hours. I can't seem continue what I have been listening. I have to click my playlist again just to make the music work. I don't know what to do with this kind of thing.",0
Long time customer but cannot continue to support spotify. Their response on rogan is completely inadequate. Will not return while he is there.,0
Spotify turns on automatically even when the app is closed and starts playing songs from the radio when i use ear plugs This is very annoying please fix this issue,0
"After the last update, it sucks donkey balls.. Keeps crashing, freezing, spontaneously erasing songs from the quege..",0
"What improvements you making? You need to mention what you updated, not just write you updated it.",1
"I have been using Spotify premium for 1 year and it has become an application that I really cannot give up. The only problem is that some songs do not open when offline mode is turned on for too long, even though they are downloaded. I think this problem needs to be corrected",0
I think you have to bring back the search bar that come out after you scroll it instead of using the three dots. It needs more clicks and people already used with the previous one,0
Very interesting more energy and enthu...,1
70 years old and love to hear all my favorite songs again ez to use,1
New update broke the app. Can't see playlist insde folders,0
Very good app better than yt,1
"This is a amazing app, but there's a flaw in its development. Its loging data in local storage increasing apps data size while using the app",0
Normally I would give this 5 stars but what happened? I don't have the bar anymore to be able to pause the song! I can't get the lyrics. Where did it go?,0
"I appreciate Spotify, though, at times, I find that some of my favourite music are unavailable.",1
I love the radio theater and the music lots of good songs,1
If Spotify doesn't fix the playlists i will start to bring old tablet to school so i can have control over what plays and when.,0
"Spotify is a perfect example of something being popular, yet mediocre. The features for the phone app compared to the computer is a joke. Basically everything is locked behind a paywall, and even if you do pay, the user interface is still a work in progress. Spotify also uses DRM, which restricts your freedom and ""ownership"" of ""downloaded songs"". I wouldn't support them for this reason alone.",0
It's really good and you can make Playlist with your favourite songs ðŸŽµðŸ˜ŒðŸ’•,1
"We'll, gotta down grade it again. Your Shows can't be removed and therfore you are forced to view podcast thumbnails you don't listen anymore",0
"App is designed for kids lacking the attention span to enjoy an album. Should have an option to open Band- then automatically list albums in chronological order, not backwards. Shuffle should be removed.",0
"Pls fix the bug,went I play the song I want it plays other song",0
"It says ""no internet connection available"" when connected via wifi (not happening with 4g), which is very annoying because some of the content won't even try to load. However, internet connection is available.",0
"Terrible, leaving the premium plan ASAP. So tired of seeing that bald idiots face in my suggestions. Spotify profiting off of disinformation that is killing people. App sucks.",0
"Poor interface, crashes all the time. I am a Spotify premium user. Poor service",0
Fantastic! Easy to use and making a playlist is simple.,1
Best Music Streaming App,1
"Look, I get that apps need to make ad revenue to survive, but I just listened to 7 ads in a row to start listening to my playlist, SEVEN!!! If you're a glutton for ads, this is it for you.",0
Spotify is awesome keep up the good work,1
There is no option to change the lyrics languages,0
When it works it works great but every 30 seconds or so the songs will pause themselves for 5-10 seconds. Really kills the mood when you're jamming out in the car. Might be sticking with Pandora after all...,0
"Great music app, but since having my new phone the music is cutting in and out and turns off on its own. It never used to do that. Then when I want to skip a song, the player disappears. Please fix this issue!",0
When I try to play some music it crashes,0
"Very good experience with Spotify, I recommend to use this app, also need some minor improvements.",1
I LOVE SPOTIFY.when i play my ps5 i can just go in the spotify app and play my games while listening to my fav songs and when im going to for my run i can just het my airpods and run with no inturps with the the app too.,0
LOVVEE,1
4-8-2022 update is trash music is constantly stopping or app crashing and it won't even show what's its playing and I pay for this service,0
discover weekly doesn't even load. paying premium and can't even see this playlist.,0
"Amazing app I can hear any song I want, but the latest update, I can't skip or choose the song I want.",1
Extremely glitchy after the update. I want to cancel the subscription,0
"The worst app for any listener! This app consistently doesn't work. I'm a music maniac who at any given time has between 1-200GB of music or more downloaded. Spotify doesn't like this. I find that whenever I get my library to the point where I'm happy with it, Spotify stops working almost entirely. Whenever I'm downloading a new album, the app becomes completely and literally unusable, and downloading an album can take up to ten minutes! Fix this broken app. I'm fed up.",0
Love the playlist created.. You never lack a playlist for any type of situation or vibe..,1
Amazing!! Love this app for music !,1
Such a wide range of awesome music and artists. Glad I stumbled across Spotify...,1
Horrible app after the newest update would not recommend!!! Downloading a different app and deleting Spotify immediately!!,0
"If you have the Premium version, it's way better. I would rate the free version a 2/5.",0
Excellent. The only thing missing is program notes. But the extent of the library and the availability of new issues makes up for this.,1
The thing I love about Spotify is if you have something you're listening to and you listen to it can you come back the next day and listen to it again I just love this app and it has every song you can think of.,1
"The go to app when I need HQ, uninterrupted and pure sounds",0
Filled with ads. Not to make money from ads but just to irritate people so they buy premium. Because the don't play ads just announcement to buy plus after 1 or 2 songs it's hopelessly. Sometimes 2 3 ads comes repeatly and then they say no more ads for 30 min. Hopeless experience,0
Awesome except I don't like how you have to have Facebook to find friends,1
"I listen to music a lot. Spotify has some issues that need attention. No matter how many songs are selected ""Liked"", only one queue will play. Shuffle as you may OR play individual albums it does not matter, music queue does not really shuffle. Spotify is about as good as it gets and it is average as far as function goes. I have to delete the app and reload about every six months due to other performance issues. Many songs/artists available but no real shuffle, that sucks on the road.",0
"I have a paid account as I prefer having my own playlists. Recommendations are usually good, I've found a few real gems.",1
I love it it's just the ADS TO MUCH ADS FOR ONLY ONE SONG. It is really annoying but overall I love the music just make it easy for people to listen to songs withe less ADS. (à¹‘`âœªÌ¤â—¡âœªÌ¤)â—žáƒ¦ÔµÕ°É‘Õ²Æ˜Õ,1
Good music collection. Recommended to learn from the yt music suggestions algorithm which gives a really good variety of songs.,1
Everything is fixed. I really like spotify,1
"Premium is a very good experience, much better than the free version. I would've given it 3 stars otherwise",1
A lot of fun finding old and new tunes.,1
Spotify has made me be more into different types of music and it has so many different things that you can listen to so what are you waiting for download SPOTIFY now!!,1
It is the best music app,1
"Don't like the ads, that's why I have premium",0
"It now can't play a thing, I mean I could kinda but the pic won't show, the loading stops and the app stops working",0
"Dude this app rocks.! Heck of a lot better than Pandora. No glitches, music just flows. YOU ROCK SPOTIFY!",1
Crashing every time I try to open it,0
"I enjoy using the app and have all of my music, podcasts and some audiobooks all in one place. I wish there was a better way to organize files a little more specific then what is available now but I make it work. Quality has always been good! The one or two times it messed up after an update I cleared cache, forced stop and the reopened the app. Simple enough!",1
"This is a good app! But I think you should change it so the ""hey spotify"" feature works wherever, not only in the app. Still a good music app! Lots of song options, you can choose other's playlists, and you can turn off your device and still listen to music!",1
"Your app is crashing whenever i play music on my vivo v21e. It never happened before, just right after i updated the app. My device has the latest updates. My other phone with spotify in it doesnt have any issue.",0
"Well worth getting even with the free version. It doesn't force you to listen to new things, just prep a playlist and rock on.",1
App is a super and incridible app own playlists also super ad will be coming once whill playing song 10 to 15 seconds this app is useful and motivation for me,1
"*amended* You brought back the previews!! And the bugs were temporary Lately had trouble with songs not playing, or have to skip 3 songs ahead for it to begin and even then it stops part way through a track. My internet connection has no issue and now without being able to preview tracks when adding songs to playlists or generally trying to find new music this is just another music app. I might as well use the free version as the features now offered are average. Please bring back the previews.",0
"Last update broke it, now goes from Spotify logo to hanging black screen to ""app not responding"". Customer support is non-existent. No rep reads these reviews, maybe they'll respond on Twitter...",0
"removing content for political reasons, I do not need nor want some company telling me what i can and can not listen to.",1
"If you wanna listen to 60 minutes that's one hour music in Spotify, 45 minutes will be pointless and irritating ads. Switch to wynk music that onlu gives fewer and comfortable ads",0
Not a good and very bad but song are not played in front page. Mans will search the song and playing song,0
"It's fun to listen to music and they have the ones I love but I don't like how they make you listen to the SUGGESTED ones and not the ones on your playlist, I barely remember my playlist but when I get the chance to listen to the music I put on my playlist it feels good to listen from this app",1
Nice app but premium adds are not good,0
recomendations are based on geolocation and not from the songs I liked. UI awful navigation,0
It has been beautiful experience and I am anticipating innovative and revolutionary content on the platform.,1
As I am a Kpop fan it l really love it and there many more songs with lyrics lt is just awesome ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ,1
"Very bad, horrible. You gotta pay for premium, otherwise 1000 of advertisements. Also, I wanna play a sing, and when I click a desird song, another song will play from a playlist Shittiest app ever.",0
You can't play 2 songs in a row without getting a ad without premium,0
Music,1
"Annoying notification and shuffle issues! Going for a drive? Going for a drive? Going for a drive? Going for a drive? Going for a drive? Going for a drive? This notification KEEPS POPPING UP after clearing the notification, when I'm not even near my car, I can be sitting at my desk working and it will pop up several times an hour. And yes, shuffle issues, stop playing the same 6 songs in a playlist of hundreds!",0
"Downloaded playlists have trouble loading. App has difficulty streaming to my Amazon speaker, or will change where the output is randomly and without my input. Had this app for over 10 years and it has gone way downhill. Spend less time on my wrapped playlist and more time improving your UI",0
"Totally on point for great tunes, news, and podcasts.",1
"I was a passionate user of Tidal, that if you own audiophile gadget it really sounds better than Spotify. BUT Spotify's library, playlists (type almost whatever and the list exists ðŸ˜…), artist selection, algorithm is galaxies more robust, and further more, now posseses CD sound quality, which is an OK compromise from Tidal's sound.",0
Why can't this app produce caller tune . Besides it is a great app for music.,1
"I find it weird how you can only skip 6 songs per day, I'd be better off using YouTube music.",0
Spotify Widget barely ever works. I still have to launch the app in the end to get quicker results. So much for having a widget.,0
"So easy to use. Can set up playlists, find music, podcasts, share interests. I haven't had an issue finding a recording artist I was looking for, yet.",0
Awsome well organized app must be purchased like everything else on the web.,0
"Good app recommended for seamless, shuffled playlist that makes me wanna visit the app on no countdown ðŸ˜",1
"Great appðŸ‘ Constructive feedback: desperately needs a function for changing playback speed (American ""authors"" often speak so slowly, with long pauses between words, that their podcast can become tedious) Edit: Still bright blue adverts for bat-flu info in the app, it has come and gone already - Im sick of hearing about it. Deducted a star.",0
Wonderful playlist thanks,1
First of all we listen to music in your Playlist and then you can't have the Playlist anymore. You can't choose your music from your Playlist to listen to,0
"I have a premium version of Spotify, it's crashing again and again",0
It is very good app but it's new update is very very bad I am deleting this app ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ,0
Its great to have anything you can listen to in your palms or even anywhere with Bluetooth thanks Spotify,1
No longer allows me to pause of rewind!,0
too many ads unlike before!,0
I love this app because when I lock it. The music plays. And that is why I love the app.,1
My personal experience with Spotify is awesome and I would not change a thing and I love the fact that my family can also enjoy wonderful and joyful keep up the good work,1
Doesn't even let me play the songs I select anymore. From being my favorite to the most annoying app now.,0
Spotify app has a lot of issues on android (maybe IPhone too?). There's no play bar so I can't pause or skip. Now it's gone even in the app! So I have to look through and personally choose the next song I want or kill the app entirely if I want it to stop.,0
There is no multiple select feature is available to add the device songs in the playlists.,0
"Wow what a very good app, it has all the music ðŸŽ¶ that I want?",1
"The song quality, the podcasts and the infinite number of songs is all amazing, but the sometimes the app just stops working on my phone, so I think they should improve the quality and speed of the app itself. Otherwise it's an amazing experience with all your private playlists and millions of songs. I also recommend it, even if my rating is only 3 stars.",1
always updates the new songs!,1
"Android auto stop working with the new update. Matter of fact, the ne update messed up a lot of things.SMH please fix",0
"Best music, thank you so much, I enjoy every day.",1
Great music and easy to locate artist,1
It's bad it doesn't let you pick your own song. It's so confusing,0
"Love your stance on free speech. Only place I listen to music, podcasts and stand up comedy. I love all the features especially the personalized playlists they recommend to me, those are always ðŸ‘Œ",1
Too many ads even for it being free,0
Nice app,1
I love spotify.but thrre is a bug and i wont let me play my music in my playlists so i cant listen,0
"I pay for premium, but here lately it's been acting very weird. I Uninstalled it and re installed it and problem persists. The music/ podcast will stop or it will say nothing playing and I have to kill the app for it to stop playing because it says ""nothing playing"". Please fix this!!! Cuz if it's going to do this I may as well just deal with ads and go back to free version. Just very frustrating. Otherwise, still loving it when it works correctly!!",0
Whatever you are listening too randomly stops. I had to delete the app and reinstall for it to keep happening again. I font pay monthly for a sometime ish app. I May have to go back to apple music.,0
"Wow this is a terrible app. It doesn't even have the capability of playing for more than a fraction of a second without pausing. The interface is horrible too. I was actually looking for an alternative to Apple Music, but this certainly isn't it. Luckily I tried the free version, rather than paying a subscription. Pointless even trying to listen to anything. Uninstalled.",0
Spotify is my companion whilst I sew. It helps me to focus and enhances my mood.,1
"Great music app, premium is a must.",1
Was using Spotify for some time but once they start violating freedom of speech and deplatforming people I am canceling my membership and will not support such a platform. Recommend everyone to cancel their membership from Spotify.,0
Its overall giving the best service but I'm not able to download any song offline I want it as soon as possible ðŸ™‚.,0
"Very good music, good quality Ã nd reliable. Simply the best!",1
I love the endless choices in music styles and genres,1
Fabiless,1
so many good songs but just really hate when your listening to liked songs and random stuff comes up and really really hate that you have to pay for auto play :[,0
I'm not able to find any music for some reason,0
So many ads and it just isn't the app it used to be. I'm a bit dissappinted tbh.,0
I've had the app for a few months with premium. It was great until I went offline for a while and when I went back online none of my Playlists were showing up. I tried logging on to my account from a different device and it showed all my Playlist.,0
Good and fantastic app for Music.,1
Spotify is such a good app if you love music and you don't want to spend a lot of internet. It's very good and I love it! Keep up the great work!!â­â­â­â­â­,1
App keeps self fast forwarding podcast. App turns my volume down every 15 min. 3 android devices has the same issue. Recent updates did not fix it.,0
"I my honest opinion, there is no better way to legally hear music. The options with the lyrics is nice too. Well done.",1
ads are irritating but the app and quality is amazing,1
App freezes when turning off the screen on my phone. It was fixed after a recent update to my android s22 but then another more recent update broke it again. Its getting real exhausting paying for something i cant use.,0
"The best music app, i was a Gaana plus user and recently switched to Spotify. I am very much happy, Spotify app is very much polished and bug free than Gaana and Music recommendations are also spot on.",1
The platform is so good and convenient. Spotify is my main app to listen to music. Thx for this app.,1
"The app is great, but ever since I did one of the new updates my genre/mood filter things above my liked songs stopped working. It only allows me to pick four and I can't scroll left or right on them. It's making me mad.",0
"I have come to a realization on why everyone chooses SoundCloud over yall, and it's the simple fact that every action is a premium action. Like if I want to pick this one song to play, I can't cuz it just plays a preview and never the song. You have to get lucky so that the random play button picks that 1 song out of 100s. And skipping, OH MY GOD.... 6 skips an hour, are yall just advertising that you can only pay to enjoy. I'd rather stick with SoundCloud they are much friendlier to use as well",0
We love a monopoly. Occasionally the updates set it back. Playlists aren't as convenient to organize as they used to be. But overall it does the job.,1
"Its just annoying how you can't play a song in just one tap. I would be better if we could just tap a song and it plays but no. instead, a different song plays. I have to struggle with skipping songs until the song I want plays. Can you please just update the app so it can be easier to listen to songs that you'd like to hear so, instead of listening to random songs that play, I can just listen to the song I want.",0
I enjoy all the music and play time never have a problem!,1
Have issues with app. Let's me play podcast but can watch it or pause or fast forward etc. Only way to stop it playing is by closing app. Also after 5-10 mins cuts off and have to go back in to app to play again.,0
"Except ads being how bad spotify ads are, this is a good app",0
"So disappointed with Spotify. I'm a premium user. I'm having so many issues recently. I'm absolutely fed up! It's getting worse. I cannot get it to stop shutting down , it is happening many times during the course of a podcast/song, I rarely get the bar/arrow at the bottom and most of the time I have little control over the play button. Downloaded/online stuff doesn't even work.Constantly having to close the app and restart. SPOTIFY PLEASE RESPOND WITH A SOLUTION!",0
"Before I say anything else, spotify on PC is good. The app on the other hand completely sucks. Can't do anything without premium. You can't even play specific songs. App sucks, computer version is much better.",0
Gduud Kumar,1
You have to pay to skip songs,0
"When I saw Spotify stand up and have a backbone against the spread of misinformation . And actually let Neil Young hit the road like he deserved . I knew this was a company Worthy of my hard-earned money . As long as they keep up the great service which blows away YouTube music . And stays in their Lane and works for the people , I will be a lifetime customer !",1
I can't even listen to the songs I love and only the songs I love anymore without a whole bunch of other songs come on instead it's so aggravating and you can't even skips as many songs as you want idc abt the ads but the other parts of this new Spotify app just ruined the whole app now I can't even listen to music that I want to pls go back a update.,0
"I use premium, but j hate how unusable free is, like u can't actually specifically choose a song to play and I hate that",0
"premium user for years. Spotify has always been my fav music & pod app but I'm thinking about switching. Never used to have any issues, 2 yrs ago I switched to iPhone for the first time - still no problems. Switched back to Samsung a few months ago, the app is almost impossible to use. You can almost never see 'now playing' to control your show or music. It randomly pauses your podcast for no reason. & It marks podcasts as played after 1 sec so you can't sort by unplayed. Also a million pop ups.",0
All these updates and still no lyrics. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled countless times,0
Best Music Streaming Platform.,1
Best music app i have ever used....but....Please reduce the ads ðŸ˜,0
No longer for music. It appears that Spotify is removing music from it's library and replacing it with podcasts. I'm not here to listen to old dudes blabber on for hours. I want to listen to music. Gonna go back to Pandora.,0
The apps keeps on saying no internet connection that turns out to me to couldn't play a song when in fact I have a strong internet connection,0
Can't subscribe to Spotify while YouTube Music is available,0
"removed the ability to turn OFF shuffle on playlists. WHY? WHY?? WWWHHHHHYYYYYY????? Made it impossible to get to the ""Now Playing"" from anywhere. WWWWHHHHYYYYY???? Monkey clowns making this interface. Several years ago it sucked, then they fixed it, and now it sucks again. My guess is they are trying to coerce you to listen to music that they pay less for (or don't pay at all for), rather than what you actually want.",0
I've never had any problems with the app until this last update. Def. unfortunate.,0
"Buggy offline content. I download content then switch my phone to airplane mode and/or switch to offline mode within the app. Sometimes my downloaded content will not play and displays a grey icon indicating that the content was not downloaded. Upon re-establishing internet connection the green icon shows and will play offline. This is a massive bug and has caused many a curse words directed at spotify. Please fix this bug, it is literally the only reason I pay for spotify.",0
My issue is how it's stops randomly and it will crash. I've been trying to fix the problem but it never seems to work and its getting annyoing,0
"Spotify acts like it is on shuffle, I cannot listen to albums because it plays a random song on my liked list instead of the next track on the album, if this isn't fixed I will be ending my sub.",0
its good but I don't like the fact ive to pay to choose what song i can listin too,0
Allow us to have unlimited swipes even tho not with premium and move the time of our song,1
"Up until now the app has run beautifully, but the past few days it's started to pause and play constantly, while also not allowing me to see what's currently playing or skip the track",0
Now playing section not working. Music randomly stops.,0
"Glitchy app.. first time in years this happened, music played even though i paused it, can't seem to view my current playing music. Please fix it asap (samsung s21+ android 12)",0
Good basic service (free) but I suggest Apple or Amazon for paid subscription since both have better music quality at better prices,0
"Currently cuts audio on my samsung a22, delay of about 3 seconds",0
I'm very dissatisfied with the new popup screen& the split screen & the 60 second preview of songs & the ton of commercials! It's too cluttered & confusing. If a thing works don't try to fix it...leave well enough alone! I love you Spotify inspire of your updating mania!,0
No network congestion affected performance of Spotify ðŸ‘,1
"This app forces premium. I can live with ads and random shuffle, but now Spotify doesn't want to play my playlists I made anymore and spamms premium on me. It's very obnoxious and I can't recommend this app to anyone. I would pay if it was not this forced.. Currently a lot of bugs too.",0
Why do you keep removing lyrics of some great songs. What's wrong with you people? First The 1975's and then the whole Flicker album. Removing the lyrics is nota an improvement. Not appreciated. ðŸ–•ðŸ¿,0
"Too many ads, and it plays louder thsn what you are listening to.",0
"now the app is saying you're offline but does everything except playing music, it brings notifications, new music etc.",1
"Couldn't be happier, if for whatever reason u can't pay for Ur premium plan, they give U about a week after the due by date to pay, which has helped me out plenty of time. Amazing exp. An I love how they make playlist for U, based off the music U listen to an like",1
I would give it 5 stars but for it stops playing unless my phone is always open to main menu. Seems to be working now.,0
"Seems to have bugs making it persistent, only way to remove from screen was to reset the phone. App keeps getting 'dumber' too, with less ways to view/sort/find music. Used to be the best, not anymore",0
I cannot share audio track on other platforms it showing something went wrong and also so many ads after one song very annoying ðŸ˜¡,0
I like this Spotify app ! Whenever I feel to hear music ðŸŽ¶ i like to use it infact my parents also like this because they like to hear old songs in night ðŸŒƒ before going to bed we will go to upstairs of our house . We will pay the songs . And we will enjoy our beautiful day ðŸŽ¶ . I like BTS ðŸ’œ offen I like to hear there songs ! Thanks for this app â˜ºï¸âœ¨,1
"Alright so uhhh, first time with spotify and I'm really happy with the app rn cause of all the recomended playlists and podcasts and I really like how there's an ad or two every half an hour and it lets you play music with your sreen off or having another app open instead of other free music apps (youtubemusic-cough ough) who dont let you do that, or bombard you with ads every song or search.I've gotten really spoiled with all these great songs ""made for me"" so thanks for opening my music tastes",1
It was going pretty well for a long time now until I cleared the app data the third time. I was doing this so clean storage and so the issue is the gapless feature. It keeps turning itself off after a while and when spotify closes after not being used for a little while it clears the previous queue i stopped on until i close and relaunch the app again. This never happened after the third data clearing. I can't find any answer for this issue so I hope you can do something about this.,0
When screen is off Spotify not playing.. please fix this bug,0
Its perfect,1
"Borderline unusable, due to slowness unresponsivness",0
Latest version has a lot of bugs. Too often I cant see what is currently playing and need to restart app. Please fix it.,0
"In general the app is good, but recently when I play music it will occasionally not show the notification to show what song is playing or the app will freeze, I also can't unhide songs. Please fix these issues.",0
I personally think there are so many ads and it make the listener irritative. I'm not a premium member but still....,0
"A very good app, the ads are not too overwhelming, and I like being able to get good music onto easy to make playlists. However, I hate that songs I didn't ask for are added to MY playlist. I end up listening to songs I don't like and can't skip more than my actual music. Sure this my be a nudge to premium, but I feel this addition on mobile may cause for less people even attempting to listen here. Other than that an amazing app!!",0
"Since the last update, the playback screen disappears after I turn off my screen, and then turn it back on. The only way to pause/stop music and podcasts is to close out the app entirely.",0
Very good when you have premium never glitches or messes up and I use it 247 premium def worth it,1
I love Spotify it's the best Spotify chooses song's for you song what u like and it's just perfect and it makes playlist for you according to what songs you like,1
"This app is amazing, sure the ads are annoying but it's fine considering I didn't pay for the premium.. just, can you perhaps release romanized lyrics too? For example, I wanna hear and sing to kpop songs but I can't read korean so it would be good if there's a romanized version of the lyrics.. it would help the international fans so much! Anyway, love this app. Thank you for the great experience!",1
"I swear its too restricting, spotify was a lot better before the update.",0
"App gets worse every upgrade on Android. App crashes, app breaks Android auto and it doesn't display current music in notifications without force stopping.",0
It has many ads,0
This is my only music app...the heck with Apple,0
"Everything in the app is good. But I have a suggestion that if you could add captions to all the audio podcasts as well than it would be nice, as it will help in improving our English I hope you take a look at this suggestion.",1
Kool need find out how to speed up music for faster speed for work out,0
Excellent quality tracks to stream or download. Library quite extensive though can't find every one of my favorites. App seems to crash and corrupt my account leading to my downloaded songs having to be re downloaded every time phone restarts or battery dies which is VERY boring!!!,0
I like play song that this app is best to play song,0
I can NOT turn off shuffle mode.. even though it's off. Half the time the song I pick won't play. And any song that's played won't play again.,0
The new update will not let me listen to all my liked songs,0
Just love it. No more painful searches,1
"The app was working well, but some days ago, an update made the experience using this app very irritating. I restarted the app, the phone, I reinstalled it, but it became worst. I pay premium and now, I can't use the service.",0
I love love this app! I can listen to my music all day long!! Keep it up!,1
Awesome and easy-to-use ... even for someone like me!,1
I don't why it's keep getting closed automatically with out any error,0
Can't even look up and play a specific song if you don't have premium. I'd rather just use YouTube.,0
Your favourite music when and where you want it!,1
Good,1
"Way too many ads, a non premium user has to struggle to listen to any songs. Not even 30mins you'll get ad less listening.",0
I live spotify it made my life easier and more fun. I am always connected to my personal entertainment advisor,1
It's a very nice app. But the reason why I'm giving it 4 star because before even when I off my screen the music will still be there and when i pause for 1 hour 2 hour it will still be there...but now when i off my screen and pause it for like 2 minutes it disappears....please can u fix that please....I recommend this app..but please fix that problem...thank you in advance,0
"The Spotify algorithms work well, but the app has broken UI in dark mode on MIUI Global 12.5.6 (Android 11). The play/pause button has incorrectly set colors, as well as some other elements on the play screen.",0
"Alright Spotify, what'd you do? Did most recent update 2 days ago and now the app crashes upon opening every time. One star until fixed!",0
"Bring back the shuffle button in personal playlists. I'm indecisive, I can't choose but with that button it chose for me, now it's gone. Bring It Back.",0
"Recently my music starts randomly pausing, and the now playing bar that's at the bottom in the app disappears. Making me restart the app everytime. EDIT: the bug is gone",0
Amazing if it was totally free,1
"I used to use this all the time. But recently it deleted everything I had on my Playlist, and forgot who I was, and I've already tried deleting it and reinstalling it. It didn't fix it. What the hell Spotify? Why did your mobile app forget who I was but not my ps4 app version?",0
I am getting too much trouble for login ..into app..,0
"Listening to podcasts, however I sort by.. it will play the previous episode next.. instead of the next episode, any advice?",0
"An excellent song app which has the song that you are thinking of. Extremely user-friendly and super collection of songs from several genres. SPOTIFY, you've got it SPOT ON !",1
I love Spotify so much I would have gave it a five but you already know its the adds but i really dont mind then because i have remebers them all word by word but on my liked songs random songs that are on my dont like pop up,0
It excellent while I play games and the songs are fire I think 4 star I dont know why,1
Excellent quality and great choice,1
This app so bad. I hate your new update now because I can't listen to music what I want. Like I don't wanna waste my money into app. Like why would you force to pay a premium so that he/she can listen to any music like what. This app is like genshin impact. I recommend not to download this if you don't want to pay any. I will take back my words and rates. if you give free audacity to turn off n on the shuffle. THANK YOU ðŸ˜Š,0
I love listening to music so this a a great app for music. I can listen to music anywhere any time.,1
Excellent. Love the service. App works well.,1
"Dope a$$ app for music and podcasts, adds are always annoying but they kinda joke about that and everything free has to make some money",0
Spotify keeps cutting out & losing the forward & back bar. Ive uninstalled this App 3 times today.,0
It could be better. I bought the premium version of it and everything. It's a amazing app but the downside is that it cuts off my music then I gotta go back and click the music again in order for it to play. This happened very often and it's to the point where it's very bothersome having to go and start the playlist again. I have it on shuffle so a new song plays every time I have to click the start button. I hope you can fixed this Spotify.,0
"I love Spotify. All day , every day... Music is life...",1
"Great , affordable Music app!",1
Recently its been cutting my music off and not working..so ive been usung youtube to listen to music but I can't do that at night. I hope you fix this pronto.,0
I  Spotify,1
"Its great, made me easy to go around the world.",1
"For the most part, and I mean about 95% of the time, I don't have any issues. Only issues I have are typically with the connection and the program saying there is no internet connection when there is, but the issues is typically solved fairly quick.",1
Spotify is awesome the music & the podacst are excellent. The main reason I kept membership was for the Joe Rogan podcast the best podcast in the world.,1
Friendly usage. Tons of variety music for all choises.,1
Bad experience always add add add ,1
"Very nice and trendy soundtracks and playlists in this specialised app.Keep up with the current system,however,do add in more skips for the normal spotify account and make the premium account public for all to use and enjoy. However, dont install this because when u play a playlist it will get stuck on it and u cannot fix it.",0
"Love the vast catalog and easy interface. Wish there was just a bit more info provided on songs (release date, album, etc.) when not seeing it on an artist's page.",0
"I've had this for 2 and a half years. Incredibly happy, works amazing for me. However, I can no longer sign in to my account onto my phone and that is driving me mad. I had written the password down and never changed it. I could get into my email that the account is registered to my account, only it's has parental control's and my mom won't allow me into it until im 18, for whatever reason. It won't even allow me in, with the saved password in settings. Please explain this to me.",0
It's nice and easy to use. Very effective for accessing any songs. But i hate the minute-by-minute advertisement that interrupts my usage of the app. Too much advertisements took awatmy interest in this app.,0
This app has gone down hill. I can't even chose my song I want to play without buying premium and there are way to much ads. I would go to SoundCloud or YouTube to listen to songs instead of here.,0
Well it was a little bit glitchy a couple of times.,0
Best for listening music/podcasts.... The recommendation it gives is next level no other app or website can do it like the Spotify does,1
"Latest update is a joke,can no longer skip tracks in any car using steering wheel controls,can't pause,if its not sorted soon I'll cancel my subscription & go elsewhere",0
"I thoroughly enjoy Spotify. I listen to music, podcasts, meditations you name it. It's definitely one of my best apps right after my Bible app.",1
I use Spotify all the time. I love being able to hear whatever song I like at any given time. It's a wonderful app!,1
"Great, for the first 30 days. Actually I signed up for the promo and it's perfect.",1
"okay i love this app, but hear me out, you didn't had to remove the feature where you could tap the preview of the songs to know if you'll like it or not, really bums me out, first i thought it was just a bug but now , yknow. so i really hope you guys add the feature back.",1
"4 years later, spotify... u freaking still rock but more everyday !!",1
"When you search a song up, it'll play a different song then play the song that you wanted later ðŸ™„",0
Excellent collection and clarity,1
Great but they say ads won't come for 30-90 mins but it comes in 10-15 mins... Overall great app love it,1
Very nice app but ads are more,0
"The control bar has dissappeared, songs start and stop, cannot move between songs. Will be ceasing subscriptionif this continues.",0
Same Ad showing again and again sometimes,0
"I loved this app, but for some months now every account I open closes after two weeks and it's been annoying. I have tried contacting the helping centre and even after the help I got they still close after 2 weeks!",0
"Slowly getting worse, my Spotify has been getting super buggy. A lot of random pauses and disconnects with my Tacoma. Bugged so bad it started playing music without knowing it and I could not pause or pull up any screen that would allow me to pause the music. Had to restart my phone, a S10+.",0
Good mix,1
It's got a recent issue where it is playing songs but it does not actually show that. It can have something to do with my earbuds. Thanks,0
"Very happy with the services, i have too many options here even spotify gave a 3 months free subscription...great deal...thank you spotify...",1
Way too many ads,0
I mainly enrolled to listen to the Joe Rogen podcast. So far I'm enjoying it very much. I'm sure I will use other features in the future.,1
Interface is garbage.,0
Spotify is having so many bugs lately and it feels like it has never received an update before from how many bugs I am finding and my just stop paying for any services from this again,0
They provide good quality music and entertainment.,1
Glitching like crazy after this update,0
"The music suddenly stop, there no pop up bar for backward pause or forward. What happen tho",0
They would have gotten 5 stars from me except they from nowhere decided to charge me twice in December and then again this month in January thank God I was a bit smarter and faster than they were although they almost had me convinced to update my payment so that they could unpause a subscription I had already paid for and their plan was to just charge my account again for this month and they can keep their music and their app and shove it up their behinds.,0
It's a great app and definitely a good way to get into a good mood the only reason it's not a 5 is because of the adds after songs,1
The best music streaming app out there,1
"I have more respect for your company as you have not caved to the cancel culture mob. Definitely going to have to get a spotify subscription for sure now!! Thank you for doing the right thing, you have given some of us hope!",1
"Overall satisfied with the app, but I wish to suggest changes in how lyrics are displayed: 1. Users can be offered different font sizes and font styles for lyrics. 2. Lyrics for languages with non-Latin scripts could be displayed in more ways for more inclusivity. Consider Punjabi, which could be displayed in Gurmukhi, Shahmukhi and English transliteration. 3. Artists can be contacted to review their lyrics as well.",0
"Would be 5 but a lot of issues. The app was working perfectly fine but after using it for a while it started to slowly get more and more buggy/glitchy, i use play music on my xbox and use my phone to change the music but now it doesn't even show the same songs or it wont play the song i click unless i add it to queue and skip. A lot more issues but I don't want this too get too long.",0
"Latest update broke the app. Constantly freezes, won't play songs, and can't cast. It's pretty much unusable like this.",0
App is shutting down on is own. I paid for premium and it's been 3 week since i got to listen to music.,0
The fact that those in premium can't download music to their hard drive is a bit unfair. Also at this point spotify should have dolby capability,0
"very convenient, easy to use while on the road its a must have over all the other sites or apps you could use Spotify is hands down the BEST!!!!!",1
Spotify is a horrible place to listen to music made by the musicians we love. Pandora is way better,0
"Great, love the choices and suggestions",1
"Latest update stopped working with BMW media system. Tried everything to no avail. Can only play using Bluetooth, little functionality",0
I Love using this app..listening to music while working is nice..thank you for this. ..,1
Is good but it keep saying to upgrade to premium when i try to select any song and keeps playing recommended songs where i dont even like or listen to the recommended song,1
Good to use,1
To update my opinion before which is now a bad one app keeps stopping for no reason won't show the fastfoward part anymore its insanely annoying,0
"So far so good! I've found all the music I've searched for so far, and you can repeat songs!",1
It ia normal app like all apps. but in this app we can save the songs like playlist i like this option so im rating 2 stars,0
Great app. Everything is pretty accessible and easy to get to. My only complaint is that is sometimes acts weird for about 1 minute if you're in the middle of disconnecting from the wifi.,1
It's amazing and honesty for them to give a free trial is awesome !!! Everything from the quality of the music perfection I just wish that there was specifically somewhere for recommend music,1
No words to say it is awesome. But adds are the problems .,0
"This is the worst app I ever use, I don't Know why I just download it but ""It's my Life It's now or never but aren't gonna live forever I just wanna live while I'm Alive"" So, Spotify AB This app is worst Remove it from playstore, I think the phone is worst, Useless, Where the heck is the Phone 's Founder Give me his/her phone number. By the way this is just for fun , Honestly, This is s nice app I say it because Playstore don't delete my post . ok joke over This is a nice app After all.",0
Great app but annoying when it rehularly thinks I'm off-line and I have to lose and reopen to get it to work. Same on multiple phones too.,0
I love this app! I only wish it were easier to like AND dislike songs to tell the app to never play songs again.,1
Excellent app down side is too many commercials and it pauses to often on my F150 infotainment system.,0
"Mobile app has gotten really bad. Stops and starts, play button disappears",0
Had an account and recently got removed for payment?? Then got a email saying I need to talk to my payment provider when I Am that provider and lost everything and didn't even get the money back I wasted on this app even though the email claimed they were giving the funds back. around 100$ worth on this account. Never again will you see me using Spotify.,0
"I just hope you could improve it a bit by including ""related search song""; where you search for a song and it's relation continue to play. Hope you get that?",1
Whenever I try to listen songs it's exits me out of app. I tried different network connections . I uninstalled app and install it again but nothing works. And it just got me irritated while listening songs .,0
Provides a vast collection of music and podcasts,1
"As they allow misinformation to be spread on their platform it must be a one star. Should have been minus 10, but doesn't have that option...",0
